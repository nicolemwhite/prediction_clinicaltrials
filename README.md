Analysis of clinical prediction models registered with clinicaltrials.gov


### Inclusion criteria:

- Registered study that aims to develop, validate and/or evaluate a prediction model intended for use in a healthcare setting.
- The proposed model must target either the diagnosis of disease or disease prognosis.
- Can be an experimental or observational design.


### Exclusion criteria:

- Studies that do not develop, validate and/or evaluate a clinical prediction model (e.g., a study that aims to identify biomarkers or risk factors only without building a prediction model).
- Model does not target individual-level diagnosis or prognosis (e.g., using AI to develop an algorithm for robot-assisted surgery, or developing a model to predict aggregate measures of a given diagnosis or healthcare event - inpatient fall incidence, for example).
