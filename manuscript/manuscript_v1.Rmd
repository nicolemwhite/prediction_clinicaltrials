# Introduction

* Systematic review of published clinical prediction models have consistently highlighted poor quality, limited applicability in practice. Examples in COVID-19 (BMJ review), oncology (Dhiman 2022), others

* It is likely that many clinical prediction models are planned but never published. Source of research waste.

* One way to assess research waste from non-publication is to follow-up registered studies aiming to develop and/or validate new or already published prediction model (latter is slightly different point - flesh out later)


* Other refs: Evaluating the impact of prediction models: lessons learned, challenges, and recommendations

# Methods

clinicaltrials.gov is a publicly accessible repository from the NIH National Library of Medicine. The database was launched on February 29, 2000.

All study records posted to clinicaltrials.gov until 3 March 2022 were downloaded for analysis (n ). Records were downloaded in XML.



## Record screening

All records classified as observational study designs were included. All other study types were excluded [need to provided rationale here for excluding RCTS]

Search terms were:"machine learning","artificial intelligence","deep learning",
  "prediction model","predictive model","prediction score","predictive score",
  "warning score","risk score","risk prediction",
  "prognostic model","diagnostic model"
