# Introduction

* Systematic review of published clinical prediction models have consistently highlighted poor quality, limited applicability in practice. Examples in COVID-19 (BMJ review), oncology (Dhiman 2022), others

* It is likely that many clinical prediction models are planned but never published. Source of research waste.

* One way to assess research waste from non-publication is to follow-up registered studies aiming to develop and/or validate new or already published prediction model (latter is slightly different point - flesh out later)


* Other refs: Evaluating the impact of prediction models: lessons learned, challenges, and recommendations

# Methods

Clinicaltrials.gov is one of the largest online databases for the registration and reporting of clinical studies. The repository was launched in 2000 by the National Institute of Healthâ€™s National Library of Medicine, in response to legislation passed by the United States government requiring mandatory registration of funded clinical trials (@mccray2000). Since then, over 420,000 unique records have been posted on clinicaltrials.gov, comprising interventional and observational studies that have commenced, are ongoing or have been completed in 221 countries (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/; last accessed: 8 July 2022).


Study registrations follows a standardised template, submitted by a lead study investigator. Mandatory fields at registration cover core study identifiers (title, study type, key dates), a protocol summary covering aspects of study design, the disease or condition of interest, intervention if applicable and outcome mesures, and additional information about participant recruitment, funding and any regulatory oversight. Details of planned statistical analyses are not required as part of study registration, but may be communicated as part of the study summary.


* All study records posted to clinicaltrials.gov until 3 March 2022 were downloaded for analysis (n ). Records were downloaded in XML.

* Studies registered on clinicaltrials.gov are not a respresentative sample (@tse2018) however, can provide a snapshot of studies that aim to develop or validation a clinical prediction models for any disease or condition.

* Pronostic or diagnostic only: add definitions for both.

* All studies eligible for inclusion were screened using the web application rayyan. All studies were independently reviewed by 2 authors with conflicts resolved by all authors.

## Record screening

All records classified as observational study designs were included. All other study types were excluded [need to provided rationale here for excluding RCTS]

Search terms were:"machine learning","artificial intelligence","deep learning",
  "prediction model","predictive model","prediction score","predictive score",
  "warning score","risk score","risk prediction",
  "prognostic model","diagnostic model"
