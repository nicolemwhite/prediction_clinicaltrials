# Introduction

* Systematic review of published clinical prediction models have consistently highlighted poor quality, limited applicability in practice. Examples in COVID-19 (BMJ review), oncology (Dhiman 2022), others

* It is likely that many clinical prediction models are planned but never published. Source of research waste.

* One way to assess research waste from non-publication is to follow-up registered studies aiming to develop and/or validate new or already published prediction model (latter is slightly different point - flesh out later)
