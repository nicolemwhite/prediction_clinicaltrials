NCT00021957,; ESCAPE Mechanistic Substudies - Ancillary to ESCAPE,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:To determine the value of serum markers as surrogate endpoints and hemodynamic biomarkers ofcongestive heart failure.; <br><br>BACKGROUND:The study will develop easily obtained surrogate markers to be incorporated into a model thatcan function in place of hard end-points in the assessment of new treatments in patientswith heart failure. In view of the epidemiologic importance of heart failure and the largeand expensive studies currently required to test new treatments; a successful surrogatemarker model would be a major advance in this field that would both speed the development andreduce the cost of therapeutic advances.The study is ancillary to the NHLBI-supported clinical trial Evaluation Study of CongestiveHeart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE). ESCAPE comparesthe efficacy of Pulmonary Artery Catheterization (PAC)-directed treatment strategy to anon-invasive treatment strategy on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe; class IVNew York Heart Association (NYHA) congestive heart failure. A secondary objective of ESCAPEis to determine costs and resource utilization of PAC-directed treatment strategy compared tonon-invasive treatment strategy.The study is in response to an initiative Ancillary Studies in Heart; Lung; and BloodDisease Trials released by the National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute in June 2000.<br><br>DESIGN NARRATIVE:The ancillary; prospective; observational study is designed to evaluate the potential of theserum biomarkers atrial natriuretic peptide; brain natriuretic peptide; and cardiac troponinsto serve both as prognostic indices and as surrogate endpoints for death and hospitalizationin heart failure trials. The first goal wlll be accomplished by evaluating outcomes. Theinvestigators will develop a risk score for patients with advanced heart failure thatincorporates the serum biomarkers and clinical variables and test for interactions betweenthis score and pulmonary artery catheterization. They will evaluate the ability of serumbiomarkers to serve as objective measures of both clinical and hemodynamic status and willassess the potential of these markers to serve as tools to assist with the selection andtitration of therapies. In addition. they will examine the relations between levels ofnatriuretic peptides; troponins; and catecholamines.This information will be the launching point for the second goal; which will be to examinethe relationship between the serum biomarkers and the treatment effect of pulmonary-arterycatheterization on death and hospitalization. In addition; the investigators will evaluatethe relations between levels of natriuretic peptides; troponins; and the treatment effects ofB-adrenergic antagonists and inotropic agents on clinical outcomes. Ultimately; they intendto construct a statistical model that incorporates the serum biomarkers with greatest promiseand clinical variables demonstrated to predict survival. This final model may prove to be thebest surrogate endpoint possible; as it will capture an array of physiological mechanismsthrough which pulmonary-artery catheter guided therapy may have an effect.This proposed substudy will be conducted within the framework of the ESCAPE trial.Natriuretic peptide levels are currently being collected at randomization; discharge; onemonth; and six months as a secondary endpoint of the trial. Catecholamines are also beingcollected at baseline and three months. In addition; the ESCAPE investigators are all readycapturing detailed demographic; clinical; and physiological information as part of theprotocol for the primary study.The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the End Date entered inthe Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2001-08-10,2001-08-10,2016-02-17,Observational,NA,NA,Heart Failure|Cardiovascular Diseases|Heart Diseases,NA,; ,; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,10,8,2001,blah,1234,1234,1234
NCT00969657,Prospective Validation of a Predictive Model for Pathologic Complete Response After Chemoradiotherapy in Rectal Cancer: A Prognostic Study; Validation of a Predictive Model After Complete Response in Rectal Cancer,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Pathological complete response (ypT0N0); <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Several extra outcomes are registered for research: Local relapse at 2 years; metastases free survival; survival and relapse free survival; <br><br>SUMMARY:Background of the study:Prediction of rectal tumor response after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) might be helpful inindividualizing treatment strategies; i.e.; selecting patients who need less invasive surgeryor another radiotherapy strategy instead of resection. For rectal cancer it is known that10-30% of the patients will respond with a pathologic complete response (pCR) after CRT. Froma retrospective study with multivariate analysis of both clinical and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data; it was found thatadding FDG-PET data collected before and after CRT leads to a more predictive model comparedto evaluating only pretreatment clinical data. To validate this model; this registrationstudy is proposed. Furthermore; it has been found that FDG-PET during treatment is verypredictive for response and a more favorable time point to adapt treatment. Also; there areindications that adding blood biomarkers to the data; results in higher accuracy for responseprediction compared to clinical and imaging data alone. Therefore; FDG-PET during treatmentand blood sampling are included in the protocol to improve the accuracy of the predictionmodels.Objective of the study:The long-term research objective is to be able to select rectum cancer patients who couldreceive a less invasive treatment. If prediction of response is possible; surgery may beavoided when complete response after chemoradiotherapy is expected or performed with smallerincisions if stage reduction is significant. This support decision system helps toindividualize patient treatment and can improve the quality of life for the patient.Study design:28x radiotherapy. On day 15 of radiotherapy en 8 weeks after radiotherapy: 1 PET-CT scanBefore radiotherapy; on day 15 and 8 weeks after radiotherapy: blood sample taken.; General objectiveThe long-term research objective is to be able to select rectum cancer patients who couldreceive a less invasive treatment. If prediction of response is possible; surgery may beavoided when complete response after chemoradiotherapy is expected or performed with smallerincisions if stage reduction is significant. This support decision system helps toindividualize patient treatment and can improve the quality of life for the patient.Aim of the studyThe main aim is to validate a predictive model for pathologic complete response (ypT0N0) inrectal cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy by multi-centric prospective datacollection. The second aim is to collect extra data for improvement of the accuracy of theprediction models with new variables. This new model will be validated later in the modeldevelopment process.HypothesisGeneral hypothesis:The validated accuracy of predictive models for pathologic complete response afterchemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer patients is high enough to tailor treatment(surgery/non-surgery and/or administer extra radiation boosts) in clinical practice.Specific hypotheses:1. The performance of the developed models on the validation data is at least equal to theperformance achieved during the model development process.2.

The study of the lymphocytes TCR and BCRdiversity could permit to better understand how lymphopenia act on overall survival and toimprove detection of high risk patients who could benefit of adapted therapies for bettercare.; The therapeutic management recommendations of patients with metastatic cancer offer standardtreatment in specific situations. But; there is always a subgroup of patients who do notbenefit from treatment and which has a very low survival. The risk of death for patients isvery variable depending on the initial cancer site; tumor aggressiveness and chemosensitivityof tumours.It's therefore important to have relevant prognostic tools to predict such an excess ofrelative toxicity or drug resistance. Simple prognostic factors for survival as theperformance status (PS) have already been highlighted in several studies. Thus; thepossibility to identify a group of patients with a higher risk of mortality could be of majorinterest for clinicians. In fact such stratification will allow:-To limit this risk by adjusting the therapy and/or associated treatments (antibioticprophylaxis; dose reduction ...);-To develop protocols for testing innovative strategies specific to this high riskpopulation.The objectives of these innovative protocols would be designed to correct lymphodivpenia.The main objective is to show that T divpenia (low TCR combinatorial diversity <30%) is arisk factor for early death after chemotherapy (early death: any death occurring within 3months (lung cancer) or within 6 months (breast cancer) after the start of chemotherapy).The secondary objectives are:-To establish that the divpenia factor is independent of clinical and biologicalprognostic factors (PS; LDH; haemoglobin; lymphopenia or ANC) to predict a early death;-To establish that the prognostic score NDL which will combine in a two-dimensional graphthe CD4 count or total lymphocytes count and TCR repertoire diversity will allow abetter stratification of lympho-divpenic patients who will benefit from more appropriatetreatments;-To characterize other circulating markers this could improve the identification of theearly death risk (phenotypic markers; cytokines ...) in combination with the previoussettings.Prognostic models have been established in many tumor types at the initial stage or at timeof the relapse (breast and lung cancers ...). It seems necessary to highlight other clinicaland biological prognostic factors that would estimate a lower survival at 6 months; whateverthe nature or the original site of the tumour.The strong prognostic value of lymphopenia in the early death after chemotherapy orhematologic toxicity of chemotherapy has recently been established in several tumor models.25% of patients with metastatic solid cancers have a systemic immune dysfunction.Further analysis incorporating prior any treatment (D0) a systematic phenotypic analysis oflymphocyte subpopulations in the patients' blood showed that a significant reduction in theabsolute number of peripheral CD4+ T cells (<450/Î¼l) was an independent factor risk of earlydeath and febrile neutropenia in patients with solid cancers of different origin (lymphoma;myeloma; sarcoma; breast cancer) treated with chemotherapy.However; early death remains rare events and a more recent study has established that alymphopenia (<1000 lymphocytes/Âµl) was an independent prognostic factor for overall survivalin patients with solid tumours.Recent studies have shown the importance of combinatorial diversity of T and B lymphocytesrepertoire (TCR/BCR) in the efficiency of the immune response against infection.A preliminary analysis of TCR repertoire diversity; in a retrospective cohort of patientswith metastatic breast cancer; demonstrated the independent predictive value of divpenia foroverall survival in these patients. This research has demonstrated that patients with cancerhad a very large disparity in immune TCR diversity and that it was not always correlated withlymphocyte count.These preliminary data show that the discriminating power of TCR diversity is greater thanthe measurement of cell count. The combined analysis of these data in a NDLÂ® graph may helpto better discriminate patients at risk for which it is necessary to develop new therapeuticstrategies.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2011-02-28,2011-03-01,2015-07-01,Observational,NA,NA,Lung Neoplasms,metastatic cancer|lymphopenia|T cell receptor diversity,Analyse the prognostic value of divpenia; To show that T divpenia (low TCR combinatorial diversity <30%) is a risk factor for early death after chemotherapy (early death: any death occurring within 3 months (lung cancer) or within 6 months (breast cancer) after the start of chemotherapy).,Analyse prognostic value of clinico-biological parameters (PS ECOG; LDH levels; - To establish that the divpenia factor is independent of clinical and biological prognostic factors (PS; LDH; metastasis localization; Hb; PMN; age; sex) Prognostic score NDL Characterization of other circulating markers; Establish that the divpenia factor is independent of clinical and biological prognostic factors (PS; LDH; initial metastasis localization; Hb; PMN; age; sex) to predict a early death; Establish that the prognostic score NDL which will combine in a two-dimensional graph the CD4 count or total lymphocytes count and TCR repertoire diversity will allow a better stratification of lympho-divpenic patients who will benefit from more appropriate treatments Characterize other circulating markers this could improve the identification of the early death risk (phenotypic markers; cytokines ...) in combination with the previous settings,1234,1234,1234,1234,1,3,2011,blah,1234,1234,1234

The lay press is inundated with reports oftragic consequences of concussion; and children are not immune.Persistent postconcussive symptoms (PCS) is defined as the persistence of somatic; cognitive;physical; psychological or behavioural changes lasting more than one month following injury.PCS significantly impacts children and their family's quality of life through schoolabsenteeism; depressed mood and loss of activities.Validated; easy-to-use prognosticators do not exist for clinicians to identify children athighest risk for PCS. As a result;physicians cannot accurately inform children and parentswhether they should expect longer symptoms; nor initiate pharmacotherapy or other managementto reduce the occurrence or severity of PCS.The investigators objective is to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule for thedevelopment of PCS in children and adolescents presenting to the emergency department (ED)following acute head injury. The investigators have three aims: (1) determine PCS incidenceat one-month follow-up in children aged 5-17 who sustain a concussion; (2) derive a rule topredict PCS from variables present in the history and physical examination; and; (3) assessthe accuracy; reliability and acceptability of the prediction rule in a subsequent cohort.Using a prospective; multicentre study at nine large Canadian pediatric EDs; theinvestigators will recruit the largest prospective epidemiological cohort of children withconcussions in the literature.This work will provide rigorous evidence to determine PCS incidence in children and itsimpact on quality of life. The results will enable clinicians to identify children at highestrisk for PCS; optimize treatment and provide families with realistic anticipatory guidance.This study will also establish a strong and vital evidence base to advance concussionresearch.; The full protocol has been published in BMJ Open (open access):Zemek R; Osmond MH; Barrowman N for PERC Concussion Team.

Furthermore; actually no data on the additionaleffects and the feasibility of longterm telemetric care of cardiovascular risk factors exist.The primary hypothesis to be tested is that an intensive longterm prevention program comparedto the standard of medical care; will achieve better risk factor control and consecutivelyless clinical adverse events in patients after myocardial infarctions. The study endpointswill be evaluated after 12 months and during long-term course (after 24 months = one yearafter termination of the prevention program).In a substudy the effects of short reinterventions (Prevention Boosts) during long-termcourse are tested (IPP Prevention Boost Study). Patients with at least one insufficientlycontrolled risk factor at 24-months visit are randomly assigned to a short (2-month)reintervention vs. no reintervention. The effects of the reinterventions on risk factorcontrol are evaluated after 36 months.A further substudy focusing on young patients <= 45 years of age at time of MI (IPP-Y = IPPin the Young) was added after completion of the pilot IPP study.

This will evaluate the success of community engagement. number of women presenting for delivery in a CEmONC facility in control vs intervention clusters<br><br>SUMMARY:This project is being undertaken to test the hypothesis that implementing a community basedpackage of care for women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy will result in overallimprovement in maternal and neonatal outcomes. This is based on the premise that there arethree main modifiable reasons why women (and their fetuses/newborns) die due to pregnancycomplications: 1) delays by the woman herself in recognizing the seriousness of hercondition; 2) delays in her being assessed and then transported to a center capable ofproviding effective and life-saving interventions; and 3) delays in the health facility inproviding those interventions. The treatments for pre-eclampsia that are poorly accessed inLMIC are 1) magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for prevention and treatment of the grand mal seizuresof eclampsia; 2) oral antihypertensive medication to lower maternal BP to reduce the risk ofstroke.The CLIP pilot and definitive cRCT will investigate whether the community level interventionincluding implementation of the CLIP package (oral antihypertensive therapy when indicated;intramuscular (i.m.) MgSO4 when indicated; and appropriate referral to an CEmOC facility whenindicated) of care will reduce the incidence of all-cause maternal morbidity and mortality.; We have designed a two-phased community (including PHC-level) cRCT encompassing both ruraland urban settings to be fully powered in each of:-Ogun State; Nigeria-Maputo and Gaza Province; Mozambique-Hyderabad and Matiari districts in Sindh Province; Pakistan.-Belgaum and Bagalkot districts in Karnataka State; India The trial will be phased fromthe Pilot CLIP trial to Definitive CLIP trial on the basis of a satisfactory rate of use(â‰¥50%) of the CLIP 'package of care' in appropriate women in all countries butMozambique. Mozambique will be unique in that they will rely on an extended period offeasibility to pilot test all Trial systems and tools before directly beginning adefinitive trial. Foregoing the Pilot in Mozambique was felt to be appropriate based ontheir experience with community-based surveillance and will ensure timelines of thetrial are met within a manageable budget.For all other countries; use of the package in the Pilot phase will be defined as appropriatereferral (urgent or non-urgent) to a facility able to provide comprehensive emergencyobstetric care (CEmOC) in appropriate women during the first six months of the Pilot CLIPtrial.A primary component of the CLIP intervention is antenatal risk assessment guided by the PIERSon teh Move mHealth decision aid. The CLIP version of the PIERS on the Move tool (CLIP POM)integrates the miniPIERS predictive score and a clinical data collection system into a singleapplication. Community health workers in each country will assess women according to thevisit protocol; entering clinical data into the CLIP POM mobile application. The applicationwill provide recommendations for care according to meeting one of the trigger events listedbelow; as per this protocol. Triggers identified that will indicate treatment and/ortransport (urgently; defined as within 4hrs) to a CEmOC facility are as follows:1. Unconsciousness (MgSO4 if sBP â‰¥160 mmHg [to be reasonably sure that the unconsciousnessis associated with severe pre-eclampsia and not due to obstetric sepsis]; urgenttransport)2. Signs of recent stroke or seizure (methyldopa if sBP â‰¥160 mmHg [to ensure BP is notlowered too much]; MgSO4; urgent transport)3. Significant vaginal bleeding (MgSO4 if sBP â‰¥140 mmHg [presumed abruption associated withsevere pre-eclampsia]; urgent transport).4. No fetal movements felt in the previous 12 hrs (urgent transport [a threshold foridentifying at risk fetuses that are alive at the time of screening] 39)5. sBP â‰¥160 mmHg (or dBP â‰¥ 110 mmHg in Nigeria only) (methyldopa; MgSO4; urgent transport[consistent with severe pre-eclampsia])6. Heavy proteinuria (â‰¥4+ by dipstick - predictive of stillbirth in miniPIERS cohort;urgent transport)7. miniPIERS predicted probability â‰¥25% (MgSO4; urgent transport)8. Shock index >1.7 in Nigeria only (the Shock index is a ratio of pulse/sBP; high shockindex is an indication of poor prognosis in women with postpartum haemorrhage)Non-urgent transport (by non-ambulance services); meaning assessment at a CEmOC facilitywithin 24 hours; will be advised for all women with non-severe hypertension (sBP 140-159mmHg) who do not meet criteria for one of the above 7/8 triggers.In Mozambique and Pakistan additional CLIP triggers based on use of the audio oximeter willalso be included in the POM decision aid.

And the post-therapeutic heart disease tends to show a wide spectrum of pathologies and multiple risk factors. We will monitor risk factors of underlying disease; family history; metabolism; biomarkers; myocardial perfusion defect patterns; and cardiac functional parameters; in order to delineation of RT-related effects and clinical prognosis.<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Background:Chemoradiation is an important treatment strategy of locally advanced inoperable orunresectable disease. Radiation dose is an independent predictor of a pathological response.In addition; chemotherapy has further impact on the aspect of outcome. Improvements in localtreatment delivery are needed to facilitate dose escalation and to minimize toxicity. Therehave been sequential improvements in tumor localization; radiation planning and delivery overthe years. Helical tomotherapy nowadays provides the most precise data on radiotherapy (RT)dose delivered to thoracic malignancies; and allows greater sparing of the heart from dosesassociated with increased complications. However; heart disease shows a wide spectrum ofpathologies; and multiple risk factors related. The damage of the myocytes may lead to notonly myocardial perfusion defects; but also in functional deterioration; or even inbiomarkers.Since the impact of radiation-induced heart injury in patients with thoracic malignancies(including esophageal cancer; lung cancer; et al) is poorly documented; we try to delineateof RT-related cardiac effects and clinical impacts.Objective:This study aims to investigate the correlation of post-tomotherapy cardiovascular effectswith myocardial perfusion and cardiac functional studies.Methods:The study plans to enroll thoracic cancer patients who will undergo local RT after completestaging. Patients will receive global risk scoring assessment (Framingham Risk Score; FRS);blood sampling for basic biochemistry; inflammatory biomarker; and myocardial perfusion image(MPI) at the time points of before and after RT. The results of MPI will be analyzed inqualitative visual interpretation of perfusion patterns; and functional quantitative data forcardiac functional parameters as well. The patients will be regular followed-up in CV OPD;following clinical judgement and guideline. The association between baseline and follow-upMPI; biomarker and clinical presentation will be further investigated.Expected results:We will obtain myocardial perfusion visual qualitative data in patients who receivedlocoregional RT; respectively. These results will help in the understanding ofpathophysiology; clinical management and follow-up of suspected RT-related heart disease.; The risk of RT-related heart disease is now well recognized but the underlying mechanisms ofits initiation and progression; and the roles played by microvascular damage; fibrosis andatherosclerosis remain unclear. Studying RT-related heart disease have demonstrated thatirradiation affects cardiac structure and microvascular function in a dose and time-dependentmanner; with substantial damage after intermediate and high dose irradiation; and minoralterations after lower doses. Not only structural changes but also functional deteriorationwas noted. Studies disclosing that incidence of post 3D-RT perfusion defect is inapproximately 40%; and the patients had volume-dependent perfusion defects within 2 years ofRT.To better evaluation of the RT-related heart disease; we plan to initiate a prospective studytrail that takes advantage of recent technical advances in tomotherapy; and newCadimium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) cardiac camera.- Estimated Case Number: 100 patients will be enrolled in the study.1. Patients with thoracic cancer will be transferred to CV OPD for initial cardiovascularrisk factors assessment; before starting radiation therapy.2. Past history; family history; basic lab data and Framingham cardiovascular riskassessment will be applied. After approaching risk stratification; patients who wereclassified as intermediated to high risk need further work-up. Who needs to undergomyocardial perfusion study will be enrolled in the study before further RT course.3. All enrolled subjects provide basic demographic data and sign informed consents.4.

Ibrutinib may stop the growth ofcancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs; suchas fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide; work in different ways to stop the growth ofcancer cells; either by killing the cells; by stopping them from dividing; or by stoppingthem from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20;which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. Thismay help the immune system kill cancer cells. It is not yet known whether fludarabinephosphate; cyclophosphamide; and rituximab may work better than ibrutinib and rituximab intreating patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.; <br><br>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:I.

Determine the effect of pretreatment clinical and biological characteristics (e.g. diseasestage; immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene [IGHV] mutation status; fluorescent insitu hybridization [FISH]) on clinical outcomes (e.g. complete response; PFS) of thedifferent arms.VI. Determine if the minimal residual disease (MRD) status as assessed by flow cytometry atdifferent time points during and after treatment is an effective surrogate marker forprolonged PFS and overall survival.VII. Compare the genetic abnormalities and dynamics of intra-clonal architecture of CLLpatients before and after treatment with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) and non-CIT approaches andexplore relationships with treatment resistance.VIII. Explore the effects of FCR and ibrutinib-based therapy on T-cell immune function.IX.

This means that comparison of the outcomes of studies is difficult orinaccurate. By collecting different quality of life tools and patient reported outcome at thesame time; it will be possible to map or model the results of one tool or groups of toolsonto another. 250 patients with IPF will be asked to complete the EuroQoL 5D; Kings BriefInterstitial Lung Disease questionnaire; St George's Respiratory Questionnaire; MRC dyspnoeascale; University of California; San Diego shortness of breath questionnaire and the HospitalAnxiety and Depression Scale; along with spirometry every 3 months; and undergo a 6 minutewalk test every 6 months; over a 12 month period. Prognostic models will be constructed fromall the clinical (questionnaire and function) measures a linear regression model.; There are no validated or accepted tools for assessing health related quality of life (HRQOL)or dyspnoea in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and there are no accepted orrecommended tools for assessing patient reported outcomes in clinical trials of patients withIPF. Assessment of these outcomes is important to patients and may be considered the mostcrucial outcome measures of an intervention in IPF. With this in mind; the majority of therecently reported randomised clinical studies in IPF have evaluated HRQOL and dyspnoea; mostcommonly as secondary outcomes; but this has been achieved by different tools. For examplethe Capacity studies(1) utilised the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire whereas the ASCEND(Efficacy and Safety of Pirfenidone in Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)(http://clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT01366209) study is currently assessing dyspnoea usingthe University of California; San Diego shortness of breath questionnaire. As there is nomethod of directly comparing HRQOL between different clinical evaluations in IPF; there is adesperate need to produce algorithms for relating the different outcome measures in IPF.The St George's Respiratory Questionnaire(2) is the most commonly utilised tool in trials ofIPF(3-5). Although it relates to physiological impairment in IPF(6); it was developed inpatients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and therefore lacks contentvalidity. An abbreviated version (SGRQ-I) containing the questions most relevant to IPF hastherefore been developed and validated(7). The Kings Brief Interstitial Lung disease (K-BILD)questionnaire is a recently validated tool for patients with interstitial lung disease notspecifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(8) but has not been utilised in multicentrestudies to measure treatment interventions in IPF. The EuroQol 5D (EQ5D) is a well-validatedglobal health status instrument designed for use in clinical and health-economic trials(9).This has been validated in chronic respiratory disease and has been used in severalstudies(4; 5; 10). In terms of assessing dyspnoea; studies have utilised the University ofCalifornia; San Diego (UCSD) shortness of breath questionnaire (SOBQ)(4; 11); the medicineresearch council (MRC) dyspnoea score(5); and the transition dyspnoea index(12).The investigators have conducted a brief mapping exercise based on the data from patientsrandomised to the placebo arm of the Treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with the additionof co-trimoxazole (TIPAC) study(5). The SGRQ data were mapped onto the EQ5D data using pairsof data from individuals at the same time point with the addition demographic and lungfunction data(unpublished). This mapping exercise produced an equation with greaterpredictive strength than using data from COPD patients showing that modelling algorithms aredisease specific information cannot be shared between different respiratory conditions. Theinvestigators now wish to undertake a larger study to generate more accurate models toapproximate the EQ5D and also to explore the relationship between other patient reportedoutcome measures. It is only by undertaking this work; that the results of individual studiescan be compared.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Unknown status,Active; not recruiting,2014-06-25,2014-06-27,2016-06-10,Observational,NA,NA,Pulmonary Fibrosis|Dyspnea|Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis|Fibrosis,Lung Function|Exercise Capacity,St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).

Additional time points when these measures will be assessed will also be tested Changes in arterial stiffness over 18 months; cardio-vascular interaction will also be tested<br><br>SUMMARY:Despite advances in cardiovascular care; the occurrence of heart failure (HF) is steadilyincreasing. The increase in HF rates poses enormous challenges; as once an individual becomessymptomatic or requires hospitalization with HF; the prognosis remains poor. Therefore;prevention of HF is essential. HF prevention is a critical issue as HF risk factors thatinclude common medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are also increasing.However; not everyone with these risk factors develops HF. Using novel blood tests; theinvestigators propose to identify and treat subjects at higher HF risk to see if theinvestigators can stabilize or improve ultrasound measures known to be associated with HFrisk. This study will enroll only Veterans.; Recently the investigators have shown that HF risk prediction can be improved using cardiactroponin T measured with a novel high-sensitivity assay (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-typenatriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Furthermore; hs-cTnT seems to identify individuals at higherrisk among those with established risk factors (such as hypertension) for HF. In preliminaryresults; the investigators have shown that individuals with systolic blood pressure of120-129 mm Hg and elevated hs-cTnT have a higher rate of incident HF than those with systolicblood pressure of 140-159 mm Hg and undetectable hs-cTnT. Therefore; the investigatorsbelieve that by using hs-cTnT to estimate HF risk the investigators can identify individualsin whom aggressive modification of risk factors such as high blood pressure will beassociated with a favorable risk-benefit ratio.The investigators' objective/specific aim therefore is to evaluate if treatment of selectedsubjects with Stage A or B HF (i.e.; those with hs-cTnT >5 ng/L and an estimated 10-year HFhospitalization risk of >5%) who have reasonably well-controlled blood pressure withantihypertensive agents (carvedilol or spironolactone) will be associated with improvement ofsurrogate markers associated with incident HF (i.e.; speckle-tracked cardiac and vascularstrain). Carvedilol and spironolactone were chosen for the following reasons: a) they are notroutinely used as first-line antihypertensive agents; b) beta-blockade was associated withdecreases in hs-cTnT in the preliminary analysis of subjects with established HF; and c) themechanism of actions of carvedilol and spironolactone provide a sound scientific rationalefor use in prevention of HF.Using a prospective open-label blinded end point (PROBE) design; the investigators propose torandomize 210 subjects aged >40 years with systolic blood pressure between 120-155 mm Hg;cardiac troponin T (measured with a novel high-sensitivity assay) level >5 ng/L; and 10-yearHF risk >5% (estimated using a validated laboratory model including demographic factors;NT-proBNP; and hs-cTnT) to receive carvedilol (nonselective beta-blocker); spironolactone(aldosterone antagonist); or usual care for 18 months. The primary end point will be changein global longitudinal systolic myocardial strain estimated using 2D speckle tracking.Additionally; changes in vascular strain and biomarkers will be evaluated. This study willhelp us identify whether both or either of the medications can be further tested in largerandomized clinical trials to prevent the incidence of HF.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2014-08-28,2014-09-03,2021-12-14,Interventional,Randomized,Prevention,Heart Failure|Cardiovascular Diseases|Carvedilol|Spironolactone,heart failure|biomarkers|troponin|BNP|carvedilol|spironolactone|prevention,Cardiac Strain; Change in myocardial speckle tracked strain (longitudinal strain) after 18 months of therapy,Change in biomarkers arterial stiffness; Change in levels of high sensitivity troponin and NT-proBNP after 18 months of therapy in blood samples.

EGFR's functional importance in HNSCC resulted indevelopment of the first molecularly targeted strategy; the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodycetuximab. Given the lack of therapeutic options for patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCCafter failure of cetuximab; there is strong scientific interest in understanding resistancein order to identify new therapies for this population. A possible resistance mechanism toanti-EGFR therapy in HNSCC is primary or compensatory activation of alternate growth factorreceptors including c-Met. The MET oncogene encodes c-Met; an RTK bound exclusively by theligand; hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The HGF/c-Met signaling pathway converges with theEGFR network at both the PI3K/Akt and MAPK nodes. Laboratory data suggest the ability forreciprocal compensation between EGFR and c-Met. We hypothesize that HGF/c-Met pathwayinhibition may overcome resistance to cetuximab in patients with HNSCC; such as those withclinical cetuximab resistance.Ficlatuzumab (AV-299) is a humanized HGF-inhibitory immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonalantibody. The primary objective of this phase 1b study is to find the recommended phase IIdose (RP2D) of the combination of ficlatuzumab and cetuximab in patients withrecurrent/metastaticHNSCC. The dose-finding study design will follow a Narayana k-in-a-rowdesign with k set to 2 to target a 33% rate of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). In thedose-finding phase; a total of 8 patients will be treated if no DLTs are observed or 14patients if at least one DLT occurs. An expansion cohort will then proceed at RP2D until 12patients have been treated at that dose level with the combination of ficlatuzumab andcetuximab. We will evaluate biomarkers of HGF/cMet pathway activation in baseline tissue;plasma and immune cells for a preliminary relationship with clinical activity.; This is a phase 1b; single arm; open-labeled study of ficlatuzumab and cetuximab inrecurrent/metastatic HNSCC with biomarker correlatives. The primary objective of this studyis to establish the recommended-for-phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of ficlatuzumaband Cetuximab. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s); treatment maycontinue until disease progression or until one of the following criteria applies:-Disease progression;-Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment;-Unacceptable adverse event(s);-Patient decides to withdraw from the study; or-General or specific changes in the patients condition render the patient unacceptablefor further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.After progressive disease; subjects will be followed for survival every 3 months for 2 years.Cetuximab and ficlatuzumab are administered every other week on day 1 and 15 of a 28-daycycle. Ficlatuzumab will be administered as an IV infusion; over 30-60 minutes;10 mg/kg every2 weeks; on the same day as the first dose of cetuximab. Ficlatuzumab will be administered30-60 minutes after the completion of the cetuximab infusion. Cetuximab will be administeredprior to ficlatuzumab as an IV infusion. The first dose will be administered over 120 minutes(Â± 15 minutes). Subsequent doses may be infused over 60 minutes (Â± 15 minutes).The startingdose of cetuximab (dose tier 1) will be 500 mg/m2 every 2 weeks.Subjects will be monitored for adverse events and toxicity during study treatment and for 30days after last dose of ficlatuzumab.

Despite some advances in treatment; there has been little impacton overall survival for both lung cancer and mesothelioma in the past 20 years in great partbecause patients usually present with disease at an advanced and incurable stage. This studyaims to develop and implement a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening approach forlung cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta.; In Canada; lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer mortality above the next three culpritscombined (breast; colon and prostate cancer). Cigarette smoking is the most important riskfactor in the development of lung cancer. Another population of particular interest inAlberta involves workers with occupational exposure to asbestos as asbestos and tobaccoexposure results in a synergistic effect on lung cancer risk. Mesothelioma is a rare cancerof the lining of the lung with poor prognosis of which 80% of cases are believed to berelated to asbestos exposure.Unfortunately; despite some advances in treatment; there has been little impact on overallsurvival for both lung cancer and mesothelioma in the past 20 years in great part becausepatients usually present with disease at an advanced and incurable stage. Additionalstrategies are desperately needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with thisdisease.The objectives of this study are to develop and implement a LDCT screening approach for lungcancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta; to determine participants'motivation and expectations associated with a screening program; their satisfaction with theprogram; and the psychosocial consequences of the screening program; to determine theaccuracy of a lung cancer risk prediction model modified to include asbestos exposure; and todetermine the 3-year clinical incidence of lung cancer in asbestos-exposed individualsinterested in lung cancer screening but who do not meet minimal risk threshold.The investigators will offer a combined lung cancer and mesothelioma screening program for200 Alberta asbestos-exposed workers based on low-dose CT scanning.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Active; not recruiting,NA,2014-11-27,2015-03-11,2021-03-04,Interventional,Non-Randomized,Screening,Lung Neoplasms|Mesothelioma|Mesothelioma; Malignant,Lung Cancer|Mesothelioma|Asbestos|Screening,Change in SF-12 quality of life score; ,Change in EQ-5D and STAI Lung cancer detection rate Mesothelioma detection rate; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,11,3,2015,blah,1234,1234,1234

CRTrestores contraction coordination between different regions of the left ventricle; whichyields a significant improvement in LV systolic function; symptoms; exercise tolerance andquality of life. In the longer term; treatment with resynchronization induces a reverseremodeling of the left ventricle and a decrease in mortality and morbidity (hospitalizationfor heart failure). Nevertheless; even if a majority of patients treated with CRT feel thebenefit; some (up to 40% depending on the response criteria of CRT) do not experiencesignificant improvement (nonresponders). Echocardiography and imaging have not so fardemonstrated their added value to optimize delivery of CRT. Monocentric promising work onlimited numbers of patients; however; were carried out. Meanwhile; equipment for deliveringCRT evolves and new probes with four poles stimulation of the left ventricle are now used.The objective of this research is to validate new sequences of ultrasound processingestimating the CRT. These tools are based on usual echocardiographic examination of patients; Pilot study for testing tools pre and post-treatment images echocardiography but also MRIwith a descriptive purpose and identification of the computed parameters should besecondarily test a large multicenter cohort .

The annualincidence of Head and neck cancers is more than 650;000 the patients each year. Head and neckcancers are associated with smoking; alcohol consumption; human papilloma virus (type 16 and18) and previous exposure to radiation.So far; most of clinical and research data about head and neck cancers; such as the etiology;pathogenesis; prognosis factors and associated factors; treatment outcomes; are from Westerncountries. However; due to various environmental factors; for example race; genetics;geographical factors; general hygiene and health care system differences; the possibility ofdifferences of disease characteristics between Western and Asian people should be considered.For several decades; there have been many studies about treatment modalities (surgery;chemotherapy; and radiation therapy); complications and side effects for head and neckcancers in the West. Many institutions tried to improve the survival rate and resolve thetoxicity of chemotherapy and radiation treatment for head and neck cancer patients. Howeverthere has been little information about the characteristics of head and neck cancers;effectiveness of treatment (survival rate; recurrence; and complication rate); and prognosis;particularly in Korean as well as in Asian patients.Therefore it is necessary to evaluate and analyze the features of head and neck cancers suchas etiology; pathogenesis; risk factors; prognostic factors; treatment outcomes in a sitespecific cohort (South Korea) separately. It could be helpful to improve the treatmentoutcomes of head and neck cancers overall; to design race or site specific treatments forhead and neck cancers; and to develop management strategy common in Asia as well as the West.The purpose of this study is1.

Need for intra-aortic balloon pump or circulatory support for acute cardiopulmonary failure.<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Evaluation criteria of risk profiles of population (French Overseas Department /Western Europe).; The risk profile categories distribution in the EuroSCORE II grid; in the two subgroups (patients from French Overseas Department sites and patients of European sites).<br><br>SUMMARY:In cardiac surgery; the assessment of operative risk and quality of care is a major challengefor both patient; and surgical team. It is also important for health care decisionmakers tohave predictive tools to compare alternative technics such as conventional cardiac surgeryand interventional cardiology. Since 1998; the European System for Cardiac Operative RiskEvaluation (EuroSCORE); updated in 2012 (EuroSCORE II) is the most universally used system inthis purpose. Its success is the result of a good balance between predictive capability andsimplicity. It consists almost exclusively of clinical variables.However; the objectivity and the predictive ability of some of those clinical items remaincontroversial; particularly those addressing severity of illness for high-risk patients. Forinstance; the degree of priority is submitted to the subjective assessment by the surgicalteam at the time of surgery. Objective data describing the severity of patients arriving inthe operating room are still missing.Many biomarkers are relevant in qualifying severity of syndromes: shock (PH; lactates; LDH);heart disease (N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP); troponin T and I);respiratory disorder (blood gaz analysis); liver insufficiency (TP; factor V); renalimpairment (serum creatinine; creatinine clearance); inflammatory condition (fibrinogen;CRP); or the underlying medical condition such as diabetes (HbA1c; microalbuminuria) andnutritional status (albumin).In ICU; many scores use biological data to measure; on daily basis; the severity of thepatient status. Their routine use is simplified by applications available on smartphones.They are drawn into hospital information systems.In cardiac surgery; some studies seem to demonstrate the measurement of some preoperativebiological variables (eg NT Pro-BNP ...) in risk prediction. In terms of diabetes; HbA1c isof particular interest because it detects underlying diabetes if unknown (emergent situation)or reflects its poor control before surgery. This criterion could be more reliable than thesimple information of patient treated by insulin (EuroSCORE II criterion).Finally; the reinforcement of existing scores with biological variables is recommended by thegroup of recommendations in prognostic research strategy (PROGRESS 2014); rather thancreating new scores ex nihilo.The hypothesis is that adding biological data collected at the time of arrival of the patientin the operating room would better qualify the patients' severity condition and thereforeincrease the risk prediction of early mortality and severe morbidity after cardiac surgery.The purpose of this study is to test this hypothesis and especially test whether thebiological data would increase the EuroSCORE II performance; by improving the prediction forhigh-risk patients.; Main objective: To improve the EuroSCORE II predictive power on the 90-day mortality and/orsevere hospital morbidity; incorporating immediate preoperative biological data.Secondary objectives:1. Analyze EuroSCORE II calibration by risk group (external validation).2. Studying the improvement of the EuroSCORE II-bio predictive power by risk class;especially high risk.3. Refine selection and definition of discriminating criteria for diabetics for predictingsurgical risk in cardiac surgery (the HbA1c value; the existence of microalbuminuria;the nature of treatment etc.).4.

Hematologic relapse was considered when > 5% blasts were seen in 2 bone marrow aspirates obtained at a 15-day interval.<br><br>SUMMARY:Patients aged â‰¥70 years with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a poorer prognosis than thoseaged 60 to 69 years. The poor outcome is the result of treatment-related toxicity in elderlypatients; owing to comorbidities; the greater possibility of other hematopoietic disorders;and a biologically poor risk prognosis. Anthracycline- and cytarabine-based therapy;administered for 3 and 7 days respectively (3 +7); remains the standard induction therapy forthis patient population. This approach improved survival compared with supportive care(median; 5 vs. 3 months) for adults aged â‰¥ 65 years. However; the overall view has been thatthe results of intensive chemotherapy in elderly patients remain poor. Although completeremission (CR) rates of 40% to 80% can be achieved in highly selected populations; long-termsurvival has been poor. Furthermore; most clinical trials have only enrolled patients with anadequate performance status (PS).Prognostic models have been developed from clinical trial data to predict the outcomes forolder patients. However; each model relies on chronologic age. Age is a surrogate measure forboth changes in tumor biology and patient characteristics. Understanding which patients arelikely to benefit from intensive therapies versus low-intensity therapies or supportive careis critical. The definition of fit to undergo intensive induction therapy has not beenestablished; and the therapeutic choice is mainly determined by physician and patientdecision. In older patients; low-dose cytarabine (LD-AraC) has been demonstrated to be morebeneficial than best supportive care and hydroxyurea. The recent availability of new drugsthat could have an improved side effect profile and; in some cases; bioavailability mightoffer future improvement for this patient population. In this setting; the investigators havetended to consider; since 2007; patients aged â‰¥70 years as potential candidates foralternative lower intensity therapy (LD-AraC; hypomethylating agents) even when theypresented in good physical condition.The investigators goal was to determine whether age â‰¥ 70 years could represent a useful andsimple cut off for treatment decision-making in clinical practice and whether low-intensitytherapy could be an alternative therapeutic approach to intensive chemotherapy even forpatients aged â‰¥ 70 years who were theoretically fit (WHO /ECOG/ PS of â‰¤ 2).; ,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2016-07-20,2016-07-26,2016-07-21,Observational,NA,NA,Leukemia|Leukemia; Myeloid|Leukemia; Myeloid; Acute,Acute myeloid leukemia|Chemotherapy|Low-intensity therapy|Older patients|Prognosis|Supportive care,Overall survival (OS); OS was the main endpoint for this analysis.

Therefore investigators will explore the effectiveness of usingbiomarkers; patient reported outcomes (PROs); and patient reported informatics (PRIs) aspredictors to a MACE event.; Accurate assessment of cardiovascular risk is essential for clinical decision making in thatthe benefits; risks; and costs of alternative strategies must be weighed ahead of choosingthe best treatment for individuals. Existing multivariable risk prediction models are vitalcomponents of current practice; and remain the logical standard to which new risk markersmust be added and compared.7 The study described herein applies a practical framework forassessing the value of novel risk markers identified through patient reported outcomes(PROs); patient reported informatics (PRIs);8 and biomarkers in the forms of proteins andlipids. Though the purpose of the study is largely exploratory; it does take preliminarysteps toward answering the question: Do new PRO-; PRI-; and/or bio-markers add significantpredictive information beyond that provided by established cardiac risk factors? STUDY AIMSAim 1: To measure cross-sectional correlations between PRIs; PROs; MACE biomarker candidates;and established MACE biomarker surrogates known to closely predict MACE itself (e.g.ultra-high sensitive troponin I [u-hsTnI]; brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]; and highsensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]; assay 1).Hypothesis 1: PRI metrics; PRO measure scores; and Candidate Biomarkers will correlate withMACE biomarker surrogates.Justification: Usual care may not identify subtle clinical changes that precede MACE. Inorder to justify future efforts to employ remote monitoring at scale to predict MACE; we willfirst evaluate for evidence of basic; cross-sectional correlations between PRIs; PROs; andknown MACE surrogate biomarkers.Aim 2: To measure the longitudinal relationship between PRI metrics; PRO measure scores;Candidate Biomarkers; and changes in MACE surrogates.Hypothesis: Changes in PRI metrics; PRO measure scores; and candidate biomarkers will predictchanges in MACE biomarker surrogates.Justification: If changes in PRI metrics; PRO measure scores; and candidate biomarkers canpredict longitudinal changes in MACE biomarker surrogates; then it will provide biologicalplausibility that remote surveillance may predict MACE itself; this would justify a largertrial of remote digital monitoring vs. usual care and suggest the concept has merit.Exploratory Aim 2b: To assess improvement in risk prediction provided by risk markersidentified in the above aims.Hypothesis: Using PRI-; PRO-; and Bio- marker predictors in combination with established riskfactors will provide incremental prognostic information compared to models using establishedrisk factors alone. Additionally; we will perform in-depth proteomic and bioinformaticsanalysis using baseline samples to explore potential molecular mechanisms driving MACE.Specific Aim 3: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of remote monitoring forMACE. Hypothesis: The incremental cost of remote monitoring will be offset by downstreamsavings engendered by early and precise prediction of unexpected and costly MACE in stablemoderate-risk IHD.Justification: Precision Medicine innovations must be cost-effective in order to be scaledacross health systems and receive payer support. Using summary results from this study; wewill create hypothesis-generating cost-effectiveness; cost-utility; and budget impact modelsto estimate the projected return on investment of remote monitoring.

Stratifying the cardiovascular risk for patients consulting forchest pain is sometimes difficult.The endothelium plays a crucial role in maintaining the tone and vascular integrity and inparticular the secretion of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor mediators. In most vascularpathologies; this equilibrium will be broken by the attenuation of the vasodilating functionof the endothelium. This is called endothelial dysfunction.Several tools for measuring endothelial function have been developed; the maincharacteristics of which are: noninvasive; reproducible; independent operators; predictive ofthe disease; safe for subjects; inexpensive and easy to use.In this study we will be interested in digital plethysmography which has shown itseffectiveness in:-Screening for cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic subjects.-The risk of a new cardiovascular event in the sick.-Evaluation of the response to certain therapies.Goal of the study :The objective of this study is to to determine the prognostic performance of endothelialfunction assessment; using endothelial peripheral arterial tonometry (Endo-PAT); associatedto TIMI risk score; in patients consulting the emergency department for non-traumatic chestpain.To determine the sensitivity; specificity; negative and positive predictive value of thismethod that was not previously used for this purpose; hence the originality of this study.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2017-05-14,2017-05-23,2021-12-01,Interventional,N/A,Other,Chest Pain,endothelial function|chest pain|major adverse cardiovascular events|Endo-PAT,Prognostic performance of Endo-PAT in predincting major adverse cardiovascular events; To determine the sensitivity; specificity; negative and positive predictive value of the Endopat associated to TIMI risk score in the the prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients consulting the emergency department for chest pain,; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,23,5,2017,blah,1234,1234,1234

Progression to AML and resistance tohypomethylating agents (HMA) are important unmet clinical needs. The pathophysiology of MDSand its progression to AML involve cytogenetic; genetic and epigenetic aberrations; and hencebetter understanding of the molecular landscape of MDS has important clinical implications.Also; future treatment strategies for MDS may involve exploitation of genetic information indesigning more effective therapy encompassing single agents or combinatorial approaches.The proposed cohort study aims to establish a registry of clinical and genomic registry ofMDS and secondary AML in Asian patients; which allows the establishment of the mutationalprofile of patients and prognostic model for survival; as well as exploration of treatmentstrategies and prediction for treatment response.; Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorderscharacterized by ineffective haematopoiesis leading to cytopenia; with a significant risk ofprogression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Conventional prognostic scoring of MDS is basedon the degree of cytopenia; the percentage of bone marrow blast infiltration and karyotypicabnormalities. Risk categories based on prognostic scoring determine the therapeuticapproaches. Treatment of high-risk MDS involves the use of hypomethylating agents (HMA); andallogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in younger patients. Clinicalstudies with HMAs including azacitidine and decitabine have shown a response rate of about40% in high-risk patients; and median duration of response of merely 9 to 15 months. HMAfailure is associated with a dismal outcome and a median survival of less than 5 months.Therefore; progression to AML and resistance to HMA are important unmet clinical needs.The pathophysiology of MDS and its progression to AML involve cytogenetic; genetic andepigenetic aberrations. Genome-wide and targeted analyses from next-generation sequencinghave identified mutations that may have prognostic and therapeutic significance. Recurrentmutations in more than 45 genes are found in over 85% of cases. Theses mutations are found ingenes involved in DNA methylation (DNMT3A; TET2; IDH1/2); post-translational chromatinmodification (EZH2; ASXL1); transcription regulation (TP53; RUNX1; GATA2); the RNAspliceosome machinery (SF3B1; U2AF1; SRSF2; ZRSR2); cohesion complexes (STAG2); and signaltransduction (JAK2; KRAS; CBL). Mutations in TP53; EZH2; ETV6; RUNX1; SRSF2 and ASXL1 portendinferior survivals. Specific mutations; such as internal tandem duplications of FLT3(FLT3-ITD); have been observed during disease progression and are potential therapeutictargets. Data arising from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have shown that the clonal evolutionof MDS to AML is dynamic and complex. The selection of clones during transformation is shapedby acquisition of genetic alterations during clonal expansion; as well as exposure togenotoxic chemotherapy.Better understanding of the molecular landscape of MDS has important clinical implications.Firstly; prognosticating MDS based on molecular aberrations will supplement current models instratifying patients for treatment. Secondly; molecular markers may better predict responseand resistance to treatment with HMAs. Thirdly; detection of targetable molecular markersduring treatment resistance or leukaemic transformation may provide an opportunity forspecific therapy; as exemplified by the use of FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-ITD positive secondaryAML. Hence; future treatment strategies for MDS may involve exploitation of geneticinformation in designing more effective therapy encompassing single agents or combinatorialapproaches. There are important gaps in knowledge in the field of MDS. First; there iscurrently no well-established model integrating molecular with clinicopathologic features inprognostic stratification. There is lack of large registry clinicopathologic and molecularinformation in Asian patients with MDS. To-date; there is paucity of data focusing on theimpact of molecular aberrations on prognosis and treatment response.The proposed cohort study aims to establish a registry of clinical and genomic registry ofMDS and secondary AML in Asian patients; which allows the establishment of the mutationalprofile of patients and prognostic model for survival; as well as exploration of treatmentstrategies and prediction for treatment response.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Recruiting,NA,2017-05-25,2017-05-30,2020-11-03,Observational [Patient Registry],NA,NA,Preleukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Syndrome,Myelodysplastic syndrome|Mutations|Next-generation sequencing,Time to progression to secondary AML.

Exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)is a first-line treatment; but clinically significant change is only seen in approx. 50-65%of patients. Patient stratification is a powerful option to increase treatment response;however; developing prognostic markers suitable for single-patient predictions still is inits infancy and crucially requires external cross-validation embedded within an a prioriprediction approach - a procedure yet largely missing in the field of biomarker research.Employing a bicentric strategy the aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that a prioriprediction of treatment outcome based on neurobiological measures is possible in a second;independent sample. Building upon findings from previous mechanistic studies; These will beincorporated into the development of a predictive pattern comprising fear-relevant genotypesand molecules targeting neuropeptides; related epigenetic signatures as well asneurofunctional activation patterns associated with fear circuitry functions; and clinicaldata. Pre-treatment neurobiological signatures will be tested for their potential as apredictive response marker towards behavioral exposure (virtual reality exposure treatment(VRET) and an in vivo behavioral avoidance test) in a model disorder of fear circuitrydysfunctions (spider phobia). Multivariate pattern analyses employing a machine learningframework will be used to generate predictions on the individual patient level and tocross-validate markers in a second; independent sample. While at site A predictions will begenerated following completion of the treatment; response will be predicted at site B apriori; but in a double-blind manner. Comparison of observed vs. predicted response rateswill serve as a test of hypothesis.

Measured by the number of points as a result of participants' answers to the validated Trust in Physician Scale.<br><br>SUMMARY:Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its end stage of kidney failure are major public healthproblems in Canada and worldwide. In the primary care setting; accurate prediction of therisk of kidney failure in patients with CKD can improve patient provider communication;assist in appropriate nephrology referral; improve dialysis treatment planning; and identifypatients who are most likely to benefit from intervention. To aid in accurately predictingthe risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis in patients with CKD; the primary investigatorhas developed and validated the kidney failure risk equation (KFRE); which is increasinglyused in nephrology practices across Canada and the United States.In this current study; a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be done incollaboration with the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). Primarycare clinics that can integrate the KFRE into their electronic medical records will berandomized to receive the intervention (patients and providers receive individualizedinformation explaining kidney failure risk; as well as risk-based criteria for referral;alongside usual care) versus usual care alone (no information on personalized risk and norisk-based referral). In both groups; the investigators will assess management of patients athigh risk of kidney failure (patient); timing of referral for patients at high risk of kidneyfailure (health system); cost of CKD care (health system); CKD-specific health literacy(patient); trust in physician care (patient); and satisfaction with risk prediction tools(provider).The objective of this research study is to develop; implement; and evaluate tools to guidethe care of patients with CKD in the community; including appropriate referral using arisk-based approach. Specifically; this study will address the question: Does providingpatients (and their physicians) with information about their risk of kidney failure improvequality of care; health literacy; and trust in the care they are receiving?; Patients with CKD and kidney failure have poor outcomes and consume a disproportionate shareof health care resources. Therefore; early identification of incident cases by primary carephysicians can delay progression and prevent adverse outcomes. However; the correctidentification and intervention for patients having reduced kidney function is notnecessarily done appropriately in all settings; often resulting in individuals at very lowrisk of progression being referred to a nephrologist; and in other cases; delayed referral ofpatients who are at the highest risk of kidney failure.The investigators propose an integration of the Kidney Failure Risk Equation - a tool thataccurately predicts the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis in patients with CKD - inprimary care practices by integrating the tool into existing reporting mechanisms. This willallow the delivery of kidney disease risk information to clinicians as part of a clinicaldecision aid to guide all aspects of CKD care; including management of vascular risk factors;intensity of follow up; and potential referral for specialist care. Patients and providerswill benefit from the ability to share information about CKD; and their individual risk ofkidney failure using interactive infographics; thereby improving CKD-specific healthliteracy.The investigators will work with the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network(CPCSSN) to recruit and subsequently randomize 32 clinics to either the intervention or thecontrol group. The clinics randomized to receive the intervention will see patients andproviders receiving individualized information explaining kidney failure risk; as well asrisk-based criteria for referral; alongside usual care. This will be executed through theintegration of the KFRE in the CPCSSN Data Presentation Tool (DPT); audit and feedback; andin-person medical detailing. Clinical decision aids for both patients and physicians to guideCKD care and provide information about prognosis will be provided in the format of a staticinfographic; video; and interactive website. Those clinics randomized to the control groupwill receive the current standard of care - information on personalized risk and risk-basedreferral will not be provided.Appropriate management of patients at high risk of kidney failure will be determined usinginformation from electronic medical records (EMRs); for all patients with CKD G3-G5 attendingeach clinic (approximately 13;470 patients from all 32 clinics). Appropriate referral forpatients at high risk of kidney failure will be determined through comparison with provincialguidelines. Direct costs of care will be estimated using linkages with provincialadministrative data. For those clinics in the intervention group; satisfaction with the riskprediction tools (provider) will be measured using a Likert scale. Additionally;10 patientsfrom each of the 32 clinics will be surveyed about their CKD-specific health literacy andtrust in physician care (320 patients in total).The investigators' hypothesis and specific aims are as follows:Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesizes that integration of this approach to CKD care canimprove the patient-provider dialogue by:1. Increasing health literacy and trust; and therefore reduce anxiety for those at lowrisk.2. Providing early and appropriate referral to nephrology for those at higher risks ofkidney failure.Aim 1 - Determine whether providing patients and primary care providers with a patients'predicted risk for kidney failure and risk-based criteria for referral increases appropriatemanagement of and referral for patients at low and high risk for kidney failure; compared tousual care without personalized risk information.Aim 2 - Determine whether providing patients with individualized information on their risk ofprogression increases CKD-specific health literacy and improves trust in the patient-providerrelationship.Aim 3 - Determine the cost-effectiveness of the risk-based care paradigmStudy Design: A matched cluster randomized design of 32 primary care clinics in Manitoba andAlberta; evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of the integration of the KFRE in theCPCSSN DPT; as well as the efficacy of a KT intervention targeting patients with advancedCKD. The unit of observation will be both at the patient and provider level; and the unit ofrandomization will be at the level of the clinic.Team: The investigators' study team includes experts in the clinical epidemiology of CKD andkidney failure; local opinion leaders; as well experts in knowledge translation and clusterrandomized design. In addition to the investigators' collaboration with CPCSSN; theinvestigators are part of and working with the Canadians Seeking Solutions and Innovations toOvercome Chronic Kidney Disease (Can-SOLVE CKD) Network. This network includes individualswith CKD and those affected by CKD (i.e.; caregivers; family members; etc.); they are theinvestigators' patient partners; and will make up the patient engagement panel. They willhelp guide the study to ensure that its findings are relevant to direct patient care.Research Significance: Since most patients with CKD are managed in primary care; the nextstep to reduce the burden of this disease on the population is to implement a strategy forthe Kidney Failure Risk Equation to be used in this setting. The investigators believe thatthe integration of a KFRE based care paradigm can improve management of CKD risk factors andhealth literacy; and ultimately; downstream patient and health system outcomes.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2017-11-28,2017-12-07,2022-01-12,Interventional,Randomized,Health Services Research,Kidney Diseases|Renal Insufficiency; Chronic,Knowledge Translation|Chronic Kidney Disease|Matched Cluster Randomized Trial,Proportion of CKD patients in each clinic who have albuminuria (albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR)) tested.

In this study; the focus will be specifically on nocturnal cough rate. Theplan is to use a longitudinal study design; in order to investigate to which extent trends inthe nocturnal cough rates might have meaningful implications for future asthma control andasthma exacerbations of patients. The incidence of nocturnal cough in asthmatics will bedescribed and visualized over the course of one month in the first stage of the study.Additionally; the aim will be to identify and model trends in nocturnal cough rates.Measuring cough is very time-consuming. Currently; there are no cough frequency monitorsavailable; which measure cough rates in a fully automated and unobtrusive way. Consequently;manual labeling of cough based on video or sound recordings is still considered to be thegold standard for measuring cough rates by medical guidelines. Recently; a machine learningalgorithm was successfully designed to automatically detect cough in a proof of conceptstudy. This machine learning algorithm will be further developed in order to provide robustresults in the field. The focus of this study will be the cough during the night time due tothe limited interfering noise; which greatly facilitates manual labeling and enables a morereliable detection rate of the machine learning algorithm.Apart from developing a machine learning algorithm for cough detection; data will be gatheredfor the assessment of patient's sleep quality based on data obtained from smartphone'ssensors.; Asthma; a chronic respiratory disease; belongs to the most prevalent chronic conditions. InSwitzerland; 7-15% of all children and 6-7% of all adults suffer from it. Common symptoms arebreathlessness; coughing and wheezing. The symptoms often get worse at night and often causeawakenings. Cough is a particularly important symptom in asthma because it predicts asthmaseverity; indicates a worse prognosis and is perceived to be a troublesome symptom.Additionally; asthma is the leading cause for chronic cough; responsible for 24-29% of cases.However; little is known about the utility of cough tracking for self-monitoring purposes inasthmatics. A first cross-sectional study has indicated that the cough rate during both dayand night might be a valid marker for asthma control; rendering it a potentially usefulparameter for self-monitoring. Unfortunately; due to considerable variance of cough rateswithin each category of asthma control (i.e. uncontrolled; partially controlled andcontrolled asthma); the statistically significant relationship between cough rate and asthmacontrol might not be clinically meaningful. Additionally; due to the cross-sectional designof existing studies; it remains unclear whether the cough rate might have any prognosticvalue for predicting future asthma control.Therefore; the purpose of this study is to explore the value which cough rate might providefor asthma self-management in more detail. In This study; the focus will be put specificallyon nocturnal cough rate due to the technical reasons. In general; the plan of this study isas follows: With a longitudinal study design; it is possible to investigate to which extenttrends in the nocturnal cough rates might have meaningful implications for future asthmacontrol and asthma exacerbations of patients. However; in order to analyze the predictivevalue of trends in nocturnal cough rate; the symptom has to persist over multiple nights.There is no research available on the prevalence of nocturnal cough in asthmatics overmultiple nights. Therefore; the incidence of nocturnal cough in asthmatics will be describedand visualized over the course of one month in the first stage of our study. Additionally;the aim will be to identify and model trends in nocturnal cough rates.Measuring cough is very time-consuming. Currently; there are no cough frequency monitorsavailable; which measure cough rates in a fully automated and unobtrusive way. Consequently;manual labeling of cough based on video or sound recordings is still considered to be thegold standard for measuring cough rates by medical guidelines. Nevertheless; a machinelearning algorithm has been successfully designed to automatically detect cough in a proof ofconcept study. Despite using only very limited data for algorithm development (80 coughs from5 healthy subjects); the accuracy reached 83%. However; the data were gathered in alaboratory setting; which limits the generalizability of the results and thus applicabilityin practice. Therefore; the aim is to develop a machine learning algorithm which is alsocapable to provide robust results in the field. This study will focus on cough during thenight time due to the limited interfering noise; which greatly facilitates manual labelingand enables a more reliable detection rate of the machine learning algorithm. It is importantto point out that the analysis of nocturnal cough prevalence described above will not bebased on cough detected by an algorithm; but on the manually labeled coughs in the audiotrack recorded during the night by a study smartphone; which will be provided to subjects forthe course of the study.Apart from developing a machine learning algorithm for cough detection; data will be gatheredfor an algorithm assessing patient's sleep quality. For this purpose; sleep quality will bepredicted based on data obtained from the smartphone's sensors.After concluding the first study stage; the prevalence of nocturnal cough in the study willdetermine whether further analyses of the recorded data will be needed and thereby initiatethe second stage of the study. If nocturnal cough does not occur more frequently than couldbe explained by chance alone; no additional analysis will be conducted implying that theconclusion of the first stage and the end of the project. However; given a sufficientprevalence of nocturnal cough in the first stage (i.e. nocturnal cough prevalence differsfrom zero with statistical significance); the second stage of the study will focus on thevalue of nocturnal cough as a prognostic marker for asthma control. The considerable variancewithin categories of asthma control shown in suggests that the relationship between nocturnalcough rate and asthma control might be moderated by other variables. Prior research hasdemonstrated that sleep quality is associated with asthma control and quality of life: Evenif accounted for concomitant diseases (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease and obstructivesleep apnea); poorer sleep quality is associated with worse asthma control and quality oflife. One reason for the association between sleep quality and asthma control might be thatnocturnal asthma symptoms frequently cause awakenings. Considering the importance of sleepquality for asthma control; the (predictive) value of the nocturnal cough rate and itsinfluence on sleep quality will be explored.In summary; the following asthma-related research question will be explored within each stageof this study: (1) what is the prevalence of nocturnal cough in asthmatics over the course ofone month? (2) Is nocturnal cough; accounted for sleep quality; a valid prognostic marker forasthma control? Additionally; the study addresses two technical objectives: gather data todevelop two machine learning algorithms; which are able to detect nocturnal cough and sleepquality fully automated by means of a smartphone in real-life conditions.Answering these research questions results in multiple contributions: in terms ofasthma-related questions; the hope will be to provide context on the symptom of nocturnalcough in order to increase interpretability of cough rates and to successfully replicate andexpand the findings of; which would support the validity of nocturnal cough as a (prognostic)marker for asthma control. In terms of technical objectives; the hope will be to provide aproof of concept that smartphones are suitable devices for sensing asthma symptoms in anautomated fashion under real-life conditions.The expected results could enable a novel therapeutic option; namely fully automatedtele-monitoring of asthmatics. Using the smartphone of a patient; an unobtrusive earlywarning system for asthma worsening/exacerbations could be envisioned. Such an system couldlower the burden of asthma for both the individual patient (e.g. higher quality of life andasthma control by identifying windows of opportunity; in which patients can change theirmedication according to their asthma action plan to prevent asthma worsening andexacerbations) as well as the healthcare system (i.e. cost savings due to reducedhospitalizations and emergency room visits). Considering the wide spread availability ofsmartphones; such a novel therapeutic option might enable large scale and cost-efficientasthma tele-monitoring. Prior research has indicated the need for such a novel therapeuticoption: the majority of asthmatics suffers from uncontrolled asthma. Half of asthmatics arenot able to assess their symptom severity properly and would thus benefit from an earlywarning system. Additionally; automated systems seem to have a higher long term engagementcompared to traditional interventions; making them particularly suitable for early warningsystems in chronic diseases. Furthermore; tele-monitoring of symptoms could providephysicians with valuable insights regarding a patient's asthma symptoms between visits. Insummary; an automated early warning system might help patients register asthma worseningearlier and inform their physicians in time; so that adverse health consequences can beprevented.The planned study falls into the risk category of health related personal data collectionwith only minimal risk and burdens. It is a prospective observational study; no interventionwill be administered. Only a slight and temporary impact on the participant's health can beexpected; if at all.Throughout the study; a patient's asthma symptoms will be monitored unobtrusively using thesmartphone; thus; minimal risk and burdens are ensured. Between both doctoral visits at thebeginning and end of the study; all control questions and questionnaires will be administeredvia smartphones that we will provide for this study. Thus; the burden should be minimal forpatients as their daily routine will not be disrupted.No invasive procedure will be conducted in the two doctoral visits. The medical examinationfollows the standard protocol for asthma. Additionally; patients will be reimbursed for anyinconveniences encountered during the study.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2018-08-09,2018-08-17,2020-01-22,Observational,NA,NA,Asthma|Cough,NA,Coughs per night assessed by smartphone audio recording; Number of coughs per night measured by means of smartphone audio recording,Detection rates of two machine learning algorithms Sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep quality index); Detection rates of two machine learning algorithms for automated detection of nocturnal cough (sensitivity; specificity and accuracy) Sleep quality measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index filled out daily,1234,1234,1234,1234,17,8,2018,blah,1234,1234,1234

NCT03723317,Associated Balance of Risk Score - Comprehensive Complication Index for the Prediction of Long-term Survival After Liver Transplantation; Associated Balance of Risk Score - Comprehensive Complication Index for the Prediction of Post-transplant Survival,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Five-year post-transplant graft survival; Number of participants experiencing a graft loss for any reason<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Re-transplant rate; Number of participants experiencing a re-transplant for any reason<br><br>SUMMARY:In recent years; several scoring systems have been developed aimed at predicting earlypost-LT graft function. However; many of them showed poor efficacy when long-term survivalswere tested. Moreover; the necessity to find an easy-to-use score represents anotherobstacle; with several scores composed by numerous; difficult to find; variables. Recently;the pre-LT Balance of Risk (BAR) and the post-LT Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) havebeen created; but their external validation and integration in this setting is lacking.This study aims at constructing an easy-to-use score system based on the combination of asmall number of pre- and immediately post-liver transplant (LT) independent variables; inorder to accurately predict long-term graft survival after LT.; In the last years; several scoring systems have been developed with the intent to predictwaiting-list mortality or early allograft dysfunction (EAD) after liver transplantation (LT).The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) is recognised as the most accurate liverallograft allocation model by prioritising patients according to the severity of theirdisease. However; several studies showed that MELD alone failed to predict early and latepost-transplant clinical course. Consequently; other scoring systems based on pre-LT orpost-LT variables have been developed; with the intent to identify high-risk cases for death;graft loss or re-transplantation (re-LT). Among them; two pre-LT scores; namely the D-MELDand Balance of Risk (BAR); showed to well predict early post-LT survival. Similarly; somepost-LT scores were able to estimate EAD; and; thereby; to predict the probabilities of earlyre-LT and patient death. Interestingly; all of these scores; especially those based on pre-LTvariables; resulted in a scarce prediction of long-term (five-year) survivals.Recently; the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) has been developed in order to bettercapture complication rates after surgery. Some reports reported its excellent prognosticability in different fields. However; up to now; no studies investigated the role of CCIconcerning long-term prognostication of graft loss in LT.This study aims at constructing an easy-to-use score system based on the combination of asmall number of pre- and immediately post-LT independent variables; in order to accuratelypredict five-year post-LT graft survival.

In patients with chronic HFrEF; as wementioned before; treatment with statins is not recommended as it has not shown benefits inimproving its prognosis. However; CAD control stands as an approach that could improve thecourse of the disease by preventing microlesions that further weaken the heart. A recentmulticenter study; the BIOSTAT-CHF [3436]; was performed to determine whether the PCSK9-LDLRaxis could predict risk in patients with HF. A multivariate analysis; which included BIOSTATrisk scores; LDLR; and statin treatment as covariates; revealed a positive linear associationbetween PCSK9 levels and the risk of mortality and the composite endpoint (death orHF-related hospitalization). A similar analysis for LDLR revealed a negative association withmortality and the composite endpoint. Future studies must assess whether PCSK9 inhibitionwill result in better outcomes in HF.There is an unmet clinical need: blockade of the neurohormonal activation has providedadvances in patients with HFrEF; yet mortality and morbidity remain unacceptably high.Approaching a strict control of lipid levels and CAD with evolocumab in stable HFrEF ofischemic ethology may represent a complementary pathophysiological pathway to reducemortality and morbidity. The burden of CAD provides a solid rationale for testing the valueof evolocumab in HF patients.Therefore; a pilot trial is proposed to evaluate the beneficial effect of evolocumab bysurrogate biological markers before considering an event analysis study.Evolocumab reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with establishedatherosclerotic disease; so this drug could play a role in HFrEF of ischemic etiology; bylimiting macro- and micro-vascular coronary disease progression. In HFrEF patients due toischemic etiology; there is a continuous troponin release due to persistent myocyte injury;which has been associated with adverse outcomes. Our hypothesis is that evolocumab may havethe potential to reduce circulating hs-TnT levels; as a surrogate of myocyte injury due toatheroma progression in HFrEF.

As anexample; at our institution; medication therapy management (MTM) pharmacists are beingdeployed to patients with heart failure with the intent of improving patient outcomes(through proper medication management and adherence) while reducing cost (e.g.; keeping thesepatients out of the hospital). The success of such strategies will be dependent on theability to effectively direct scarce resources to deliver appropriate/needed care topatients. In this prospective; pragmatic randomized and matched controlled study; theinvestigators hypothesize that the combination of accurate; data-driven benefit models andMTM pharmacist intervention in patients with heart failure will result in reduced 1-yearmortality and hospital admissions. Using our extensive historical electronic health recorddata; the investigators have developed a machine learning model that; for individual patientswith heart failure; predicts risk and benefit (that is; reduction in risk) associated withclosing specific care gaps. These care gaps represent standard evidence-based treatmentsthat may be missing for an individual patient; such as beta blockers or flu shots. Theinvestigators will use this model to define three cohorts to be studied: 1) a high risk/highbenefit group to be referred for MTM pharmacist intervention; 2) a high risk/high benefitgroup to continue with existing standard of care (not necessarily involving MTM pharmacy);and 3) a high risk/low benefit group to be referred for MTM pharmacist intervention.Comparison of groups 1 and 2 (for which assignment is randomized) will evaluate theeffectiveness of the MTM pharmacy intervention; while comparison of groups 1 and 3 willevaluate the accuracy of the benefit model prediction and importance of appropriate patientselection for treatment. The primary study outcomes will be mortality and number of hospitaladmissions during 1-year follow-up following study enrollment.; Heart failure is a highly prevalent; complex disease associated with significant morbidityand cost. For example; Geisinger manages over 900 heart failure admissions per year; witheach admission costing an estimated $10;000-$12;000. As payment models continue to shift fromfee-for-service to value-based; significant investments are occurring in care team resourcesto help manage populations of patients with heart failure. These care team resources havedemonstrated effectiveness. For example; internal Geisinger metrics indicate thatinterventions led by clinical pharmacists aimed at poorly controlled type II diabetics haveresulted in a sustained median 1% (absolute) drop in hemoglobin hemoglobin a1C (glycatedhemoglobin). In this new environment; intelligent deployment of limited resources is criticalto drive quality and contain costs.In heart failure; current risk prediction have demonstrated poor prognostic abilities andpresent a barrier to precision delivery of care team resources. Currently approaches arelimited due to not fully utilizing rich; highly granular objective data such as imaging;laboratory values; and vital signs; and therefore are not optimized to accurately predictoutcomes. The investigators have generated a machine learning model to predict both 1-yearsurvival and heart failure hospitalization within 6 months of echocardiography. This modelutilized 169 input variables including clinical data; imaging measures; and 18 care gapvariables. Our results showed not only that the machine learning model had far superioraccuracy to predict the morbidity endpoints compared to current approaches utilizing billingcode data; but also that care gap variables were important for predicting 1-year survival.Moreover; the investigators showed that closing four of the care gap variables (fluvaccination; evidence-based beta blocker treatment; ACE (angiotensin-converting-enzyme)inhibitor/ARB (angiotensin receptor blockers) treatment; and control of diabetic a1C (i.e.;values in goal)) resulted in a predicted improvement in 1-year survival of ~1200 (out of~11;000) patients. This study therefore aims to apply this machine learning approach todirect care team resources in a clinical setting to evaluate its impact on patient survivaland healthcare utilization.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Enrolling by invitation,NA,2019-01-11,2019-01-15,2021-08-02,Interventional,Randomized,Health Services Research,Heart Failure,Heart Failure|Machine Learning|Medication Therapy Management|Supervised Machine Learning|Population Health Management,All-cause mortality.

The complex interaction of human; vehicle and environmental factors along withlack of sustainable preventive programs has contributed to this 'silent epidemic' ofinjuries. Amongst Injuries; Traumatic Brain Injuries is the leading cause of morbidity andmortality.The young working men of age 20-40 years are the most vulnerable group to suffer a TraumaticBrain Injury[3]. Around 60% of those with TBI do not resume work[3]. A study done in Delhi;India showed that patients with severe TBI who were unconscious at discharge; 50% of themdied at six months and another 30% remained in vegetative state[4].Clinicians have to answer about the prognosis of the injured patient to the anxious near oneson arrival as well as throughout the course of treatment. Researches have shown prognosticmodels are statistical models that combine data from patients to predict outcome are likelyto be more accurate than simple clinical predictions[5]. A multicenter randomized controltrial published a prediction model for traumatic brain injury patients[6]. Unlike otherprediction models this model was based on data from High Income and Low Middle-IncomeCountries. However; the external validation of this prediction model was not done in LMICsdata[7]. Hence to fill this gap we aim to study the outcome of patients with Traumatic BrainInjury and also validate the CRASH trial prediction model in traumatic brain injury patient.e.g. A 45 year old male ; came with road traffic accident leading to traumatic brain injury.His Glasgow Coma Scale was E4V4M5; both the pupils reacting to light and CT scan brainsuggestive of Sub-dural hematoma of thickness approximately 3 mm along left basi-frontalsuperior and middle frontal convexities without significant underlying mass effect. Thesedetails inserted in CRASH PROGNOSTIC MODEL calculator as shown below. As per this themortality at 14 day is 4.4% and morbidity at 6th month is 12.6% i.e. unfavorable outcome.Data collection Data collection will be done by a resident and a medical student of the samehospital. Patients will be prospectively followed in the ward till discharge or death.Information will be entered in the case record form based on patients file. Written; validinformed consent will be taken to follow up patients on day 14th day and 6 months after thedate of injury by telephonic conversation.Outcomes:Outcome of the study is mortality at 14th day and mortality and morbidity at 6th months afterhead injury. This morbidity at 6th months will be measured by using GLASGOW OUTCOME SCALE bytelephonic conversationVariables:Demographic Variables; mechanism of injury; transfer status; vital parameters on admissionlike systolic blood pressure; heart rate; Glasgow coma scale will be noted from case records.Patients pupillary response will be collected from case record sheet. Ct scan findings andwhether or not patient was operated (neurosurgery) will be noted. Other injuries will also berecorded.Sample Size The sample size for an external validation study should have at least 100patients with the outcome and 100 without the outcomes[8;]. The short-term outcome ismortality at 14 days. The mortality in all groups of TBI is 23%. So; to have 100 events wewill need a sample size of minimum 500 patients. An interim analysis will be done at one yearto see if the sample size is met and a further decision on the study duration will be made.Analysis Data will be entered in Microsoft Excel 2016 and statistical analysis will be doneusing SPSS version 17. We will assess the performance of the models in our dataset in termsof discrimination and calibration. Discrimination describes how well a model distinguishesbetween patients with and without the outcome of interest. Calibration indicates how closelypredicted outcomes match observed outcomes.To assess discrimination; we will calculate the area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve (AUC). An AUC of 1 implies perfect discrimination; whereas an AUC of 0.5implies that a model's discrimination is no better than chance.To assess calibration; we will plot observed versus predicted outcome. Ethics Informedconsent will be taken by the co-investigator of this study from the patient/relative (legalrepresentative); after patient is admitted in the ward. The informed consent will be tofollow up the patient telephonically at 14 days and 6 months from the date of injury.

The target vessel will be defined as the treated vessel with 2nd generation DES which was assessed by post stent fractional flow reserve.<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Independent predictors for target vessel failure; Clinical; angiographic and physiologic covariables will be evaluated using machine learning for identifying the independent predictors (ex. random survival forest model).<br><br>SUMMARY:The prognostic factors after a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have not beencomprehensively investigated. The investigators sought to develop a risk model to predictfuture clinical events after PCI using contemporary coronary stents.; Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a standard treatment strategy for coronary arterydisease (CAD). With the presence of myocardial ischemia; PCI reduces the risks of death;myocardial infarction (MI) and revascularization compared to medical therapy. However; therisk of future clinical events still remain high and about 10% of patients experiencedfurther cardiovascular events after PCI. There are several factors that are associated withthese poor outcomes. Known patient-related risk factors are diabetes mellitus; chronic kidneydisease; left ventricular dysfunction; previous MI and presentation with the acute coronarysyndrome. Procedure-related factors; such as stent underexpension; malapposition; edgedissection; the number of the used stent and total stent length; are also related to poorprognosis after PCI. Recent studies reported that fractional flow reserve (FFR) aftercoronary stenting; or post PCI FFR; was associated with future clinical outcomes after PCIand low post PCI FFR value was associated with procedural factors. However; all of these riskfactors were identified in individual studies there have been no studies that comprehensivelyevaluated these risk factors. Therefore; the investigators sought to investigate the riskpredictors of future clinical events in patients after PCI and develop a risk model;incorporating clinical; angiographic; and physiologic factors; to predict the clinical eventsafter PCI using contemporary coronary stents.The study population of this study is from the International Post PCI FFR Registry; whichincluded 4 different registries from Korea; China; and Japan. All patients in this registryare available with clinical; angiographic and physiologic data and used 2nd generationdrug-eluting stent (DES) for PCI. The COE-PERSPECTIVE registry (NCT01873560) was designed toevaluate the clinical relevance of post PCI FFR from 9 hospitals in Korea and Japan andenrolled a total of 835 patients available post PCI FFR value after angiographicallysuccessful PCI between May 2013 and December 2016. The 3V-FFR-FRIENDS registry (NCT01621438)enrolled a total of 1;136 patients (3;298 vessels) who underwent 3-vessel FFR measurementsfrom 12 centers in Korea; Japan; and China between November 2011 and March 2014. Among them;266 patients with 337 vessels who measure post PCI FFR values were included in thisinternational registry. The DKCRUSH VII registry (ChiCTR-PRCH-12001976) enrolled a total of1;476 patients from 9 hospitals (5 hospitals in China; 2 hospitals in the United States; 1hospital in Asia and 1 hospital in European country) between May 2012 and September 2013 toevaluate the prognostic value of post PCI FFR on patients' future outcome. For thisinternational registry; 780 patients with 794 vessels from Nanjing First Hospital in China;who were available with whole clinical; angiographic and physiologic data; were included inthis registry.

CC-1 binds to human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate cancer cellsas well as to tumor vessels of CRPC; thereby allowing for a dual mode of anti-cancer action.CC-1 was developed in a novel format which not only prolongs serum half-life but mostimportantly reduces off-target T cell activation with expected fewer side effects. Togetherwith preemptive IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blockade using tocilizumab; this allows for applicationof effective bsAb doses with expected high anticancer activity. The study comprises twophases. The first phase is a doseescalation phase with concomitant prophylactic applicationof tocilizumab to evaluate the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-1. This is followed by adose-expansion phase (also with prophylactic IL-6R blockade using tocilizumab); as thisapproach has been shown to be efficient and beneficial for patients. A translational researchprogram comprising; among others; analysis of CC-1 half-life and the induced immune responseas well as molecular profiling in liquid biopsies will serve to better define the mode ofaction of CC-1 and to identify biomarkers for further clinical development.; Study rationale with regard to patient populations and test drugCRCP is an aggressive malignant disease with poor prognosis after failure of establishedtherapies. Any drug employed after third-line treatment is associated with only limitedclinical benefit. Therefore; there is a high medical need for new therapeutic approaches inthis patient population. While progress has been made in the field of immunotherapeutics forother tumor types; no relevant progress in immunotherapeutic options in CRPC has beenachieved over the last years. The rationale for the therapeutic use of CC-1 is based on itsproposed mode of action as a bsAb being specifically designed to direct T cells via its CD3binding part towards tumor target cells via its PSMA binding part. Furthermore; CC-1 alsoreacts with tumor vessels of CRPC thereby allowing for a dual mode of anti-cancer action byalso attacking tumor blood supply and allowing for improved influx of immune effector cells.Due to its unique ability to redirect T cells via CD3 for PSMA-expressing tumor cell lysis;CC-1 can elicit repeated target cell elimination by cytotoxic T cells and a polyclonalresponse of previously primed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Compared to other immunotherapeuticspresently being approved or in development (bsAbs with alternative formats like theauthorised bsAb blinatumomab or other antibodies or CART cells); CC-1 is expected to offerthe following major advantages:(i) Reduction of off-target T cell activation and thus reduction of side effects due to itsoptimized format (ii) The possibility to tightly steer anti-target activity via serumlevel-controlled antibody application which; in contrast to CART cells; allows fortermination of activity if desired.On the background of the poor prognosis of patients with CRPC after third-line therapy; thebsAb CC-1 holds promise as a new treatment option of immunotherapy for these patients.Study rationale with regard to objectives and further development of CC-1 In nonclinicalstudies; in vitro and in vivo; proof of concept; preliminary PK and PK/PD effects as well astoxicology have been evaluated as described in detail in the IB; section 5. However; due todifferences between animal models and the human situation; some aspects have to be assessedand further characterised in humans. For example; the target mediated drug disposition(TMDD); an effect that largely influences the serum half-life of antibody moleculesparticularly at low concentrations; cannot be properly addressed in mice. Furthermore;nonhuman primates (NHP) and rodents have several limitations as predictive models fortoxicity and immunogenicity evaluation of CC-1. The CD3 binding part of CC-1 does notcross-react with CD3 of macaques and thus it is not possible to evaluate in these NHPs doselimiting side effects. Likewise; although CC-1 is cross-reactive with macaque-PSMA; PSMAdistribution in macaques significantly differs from that in humans. The same holds true forrodents. Therefore; a First in Human study is planned for CC-1 to overcome these limitationsand to characterise the effects of CC-1 in humans.The planned phase I trial is designed to confirm and further explore the safety andtolerability of the PSMAxCD3 bsAb CC-1 in adult patients with CRPC after third-line therapy.The primary objective is incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) under therapy withCC-1. Furthermore; the trial aims to expand experience on pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamicsand toxicology of CC-1 from nonclinical studies to the human situation in relation to the PK;expected efficacy and safety. A focus will be on the following specific aspects/parameters:-Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CC-1 in humans-Immunogenicity of CC-1 in humans based on both absolute (number and percentage ofsubjects who develop human anti-human antibody (HAHA).-Absolute changes from baseline in the tumor marker (PSA)-Absolute changes from baseline in laboratory parameters-Change in cytokines from baseline-Assessment of response rate by ReCist on routine imaging-Overall and progression free survivalRationale for preemptive IL-6R blockade by Tocilizumab prevent development of CRS in thefirst place than to treat CRS once it has arisen. This strategy holds promise to increase thesafety of study patients and timely study conduct.By starting the study treatment with CC-1 directly with prophylactic tocilizumab; all studypatients will benefit from the expected advantage of this combination with regard to safetyand can be treated with sufficiently high doses of CC-1 to achieve dose levels high enough tohopefully result in efficacy effects.The rationale for preemptive IL-6R blockade bytocilizumab treatment is based on i. The firmly established efficiency and safety oftocilizumab for the treatment of CRS ii. Lack of clear evidence for increased tumor growth aspotential drawback of IL-6R blockage iii. Observations that IL-6 activity; while beingresponsible for the undesirable sequelae of CRS; appears not to be required for thetherapeutic activity of CC-1 CRS that was induced by therapy with the approved bsAbblinatumomab was reported to be successfully treated by tocilizumab. Most importantly;despite rapid disappearance of clinical CRS symptoms; the therapeutic activity of the bsAbblinatumomab was maintained. Furthermore; tocilizumab was also used in the very recent FIHstudy with the REGN1917 (CD20xCD3) antibody (Bannerji et al.; 2018). Our own nonclinicalstudies demonstrate that tocilizumab does not impair the therapeutic activity of CC-1;neither in vitro nor in vivo. This is in contrast to steroids which are currently recommendedand used as pre- and concomitant treatment to prevent CRS upon blinatumomab therapy. Due tothe mechanism of action of tocilizumab; there is a theoretical risk of tumor development ortumor progression due to immune modulation. On the basis of the current literature derivedfrom large studies conducted in Japan; the USA and Europe; however; there is no evidence foran increased tumor risk upon application of tocilizumab. Only one Japanese study described aminimally increased risk of de novo lymphoma development. However; this could not beconfirmed in any other study. Especially for prostate cancer; there is no evidence for anincreased incidence rate. Furthermore; tocilizumab is currently being investigated in severalPhase I/II studies for the treatment of solid and hematological neoplasias without availableevidence for an influence on tumor pathophysiology. Based on these findings; no relevantnegative effects of tocilizumab on the efficacy and safety of CC-1are expected.Trial Duration and Schedule A treatment cycle consists of 21 days; comprising 7 days (d1-7)of CC-1 application as continuous infusion; followed by a treatment free period with furtherclose monitoring for safety. The duration of the trial for each patient is expected to be atleast 3 months including the first treatment cycle of 21 days and a safety follow-up on day90 (end of study; EOSf). Thereafter; a continuous survival follow-up every three months isconducted for one year after EOSf. In case of clinical benefit; treatment period can belonger.Screening period; enrollment and baseline The screening period is part of the study andbegins 14 days prior to first treatment. The patient is informed about the study by theinvestigator and has to sign informed consent. In the following; further measures andanalyses are performed to check whether the patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria.If a patient meets all criteria; he is enrolled in the study. If he does not meet allcriteria; he is not enrolled but documented as a screening failure.Baseline values are the following:-Routine imagingimaging and analysis of HAHA are both assessed in the screening period(up to day -14).-Baseline values for Quality of Life are assessed in the screening period (up to day -14)-Baseline values for PSA; cytokines; pharmacokinetics and liquid biopsy are takendirectly before start of CC-1 infusion (on day 1)-Baseline values for hematology and blood chemistry as well as coagulation parameters aretaken directly before start of CC-1 infusion (on day 1)-Baseline for signs and symptoms of disease as well as vital signs (for evaluation ofCRS) are documented directly before start of CC-1 infusion (on day 1)Treatment Cycle Each treatment cycle of an individual patient is 21 (Â±2) days. Every cyclecomprises a treatment period (d1-7) with a continuous infusion (daily) of CC-1 afterpreemptive tocilizumab application and an infusion free period (d8-21). While for d1-9 thepatients are hospitalized and closely monitored; day 10-21 is planned as outpatient periodwith outpatient self-monitoring and visits at the hospital at d15 and d21 (EOT). Discharge ofthe patient is planned at day 9 but depending on the patientÂ´s condition. At the discretionof the physician; the patient can be also discharged at day 10 (or later). Justification ofcontinuous infusion Continuous infusion has been utilized in several phase I/II studies withthe bsAb blinatumomab: In a phase I/II study in children with refractory ALL; blinatumomabwas applied as 24 continuous infusion over 4 weeks. A 24h continuous infusion of blinatumomabwas also applied in first investigations in adults (NCT00274742) as well as in a phase IIstudy in adults with refractory B-ALL. Overall; continuous infusion is expected to providereasonable safety due to avoidance of peak serum levels with subsequent rapid decline.Justification of length of treatment (infusion) with CC-1: A treatment duration of 7 days waschosen for the following reasons:It is expected that no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be identified in the dose expansionphase and that patients will receive the maximum tested dose. At higher dose levels; forreasons of safety we implemented step dosing on day 1 and day 2 of each cycle followed byapplication of the target dose (to be determined; possible maximum tested dose) over 5 days.This is based on our published observations that CD3-mediated activation of T cells withinPBMC populations in vitro requires 3 days until full activation is achieved. Notably; inthese in vitro analyses high antibody concentrations (3Î¼g/ml and thus several orders ofmagnitude more than those that will be achieved in our study patients) were utilized. It wasalso observed in a previous study that the presence of human serum reduces CD3-mediated Tcell activation. For these reasons; we conclude that exposure to active drug levels foradditional 2 days (and thus 5 days in total after day 2) may ascertain optimal T cellactivation.Justification of length of cycle:A cycle length of 21 days was chosen for the following reasons:The calculated half-life in mice of about 48h is based on the simplified assumption of anexponential decline within the first 24h. Thereafter serum concentration declined at a slowerrate indicating a biphasic elimination. For calculation of the cycle interval we thereforeassumed a half-life of 48h. Considering that CC-1 application is completed on day 8; a marginof 5 half-lifes (equaling to 10 days) results in an overall interval of 18 days.Additionally; based on our reported findings that after achieving maximal T cell activation adecline of activity over 3 further days is observed; for reasons of safety we plan to allowfor 3 additional days until the end of treatment (EOT) visit is conducted (18 plus 3 days)and treatment can potentially be repeated. Notably; in the dose escalation cohort; approvalof the DSMB is required before a new patient can be treated with the next dose level; forwhich we calculate an additional 7 days. Thus; a second cycle of treatment can be applied atday 21 to the same patient; but treatment of new patients; for reasons of uniformity; isgenerally conducted at day 28 of the antecedent patient at the earliest.Additional Cycles It is assumed that additional treatment cycles do not increase the risk butwould rather benefit patients. Therefore; in case of positive response; the patient isallowed to continue treatment with up to 5 further treatment cycles. This is intended toallow patients to benefit better from therapy in case it is effective. Positive response toCC-1 treatment in previous cycle comprises (but is not limited to) a substantial PSA drop(>20% reduction compared to day 1 pretreatment as determined on day 15). To obtain additionalcycles; patients must still meet the initial key eligibility criteria assessed between 6-8days prior to the next cycle (excluding cardiac ultrasound; lung function; virology;tuberculosis testing; CT/MRI imaging). Patients are required to sign the informed consentform for additional CC-1 cycles. Study visits and investigations are performed as describedfor the first cycle of CC-1 treatment. This includes all obligations for safety-reporting anddocumentation. The dose of CC-1 in additional cycles is the same as in the patientÂ´s firstcycle. In case of additional cycles; the end of safety follow-up (EOSf) visit is prolonged to90 days after start of the last CC-1 cycle. Routine imaging is planned every 90 days (+/- 7days).Post-Treatment Follow-Up until End of safety follow-up (EOSf)After the treatment cycle (s); follow-up of patients is planned as follows:After the last visit of the last treatment cycle at d21 (EOT); a follow-up visit is plannedat d 90 (Â± 7) (69 days after EOT). In case of only one treatment cycle; this visit is theEOSf for this patient. This time point was chosen based on clinical practice and assessmentaccording to RECIST criteria (see secondary endpoints). A comprehensive workup is planned onthis visit. In case of additional cycles; the EOSf visit is prolonged to 90 days after startof the last CC-1 cycle.Follow-up after EOSf until EOS After EOSf; each patient is followed every 90 days (Â± 7) forup to one 1 year. EOS will be the last visit one year after EOSf; unless study treatment isterminated earlier.In case the patient is reported to have progressive disease on routine imaging; theinvestigator may decide to perform an additional visit 28-42 days later.Patient care after last follow-up After finishing all study-relevant procedures; therapy andfollow-up period as described above; the patient are followed in terms of routine care andtreated if necessary; by the primary responsible oncology center. Any attempt should be madeby the investigator to follow the patient in particular with regard to any safety issues evenafter the last assessment at EOS.Estimated timelines The recruitment period may vary substantially based on observedtoxicities; but is expected to be 2 years; and an overall study duration of 3.25 years isanticipated.

NCT04122131,Characterization of Fibrotic Focus as a Prognostic Marker in Breast Cancer; Fibrotic Focus in Breast Cancer,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Prognostic value of fibrotic focus; AUC in percentage (%) in prognostic model based on fibrotic focus features<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Despite the ongoing refinement of current breast cancer staging; clinical outcome is stillvaried among patients of similar stage. Further exploration of novel prognostic factors is ofgreat clinical value. In our earlier findings; we have demonstrated the added value offibrotic focus (FF) in the current staging. However the precise composition in differentcomponents within FF and underlying mechanism involved remain to be determined. In fact;there is unappreciated heterogeneity in FF. All these have limited its application inclinical practice. In this proposal; a systemic evaluation on the FF features in breastcancers will be performed. We aim to further characterize FF at morphological; cellular andmolecular levels as well as its collagen characteristics. Given the multiple lines ofevidence showing its relationship with immune components; additional attention will be put onits interaction with immune tumor environment. Finally; we plan to develop prognostic modelintegrating these different FF features for a more accurate risk stratification. Accumulatedevidence suggested that the significance of FF in breast cancer prognosis. Moreover; theimpact of fibrotic stroma on tumor immune environment may be implicative in immunotherapy.The more complete understanding of FF is pre-requisite for its development as an applicableprognostic marker in breast cancer.; Background Breast cancers exhibit a wide scope of morphologic features with demonstratedprognostic significance. These features have the advantage of easily evaluated in routinereporting; thus offering great clinical potential. In our earlier analysis; fibrotic focus(FF) was demonstrated to have added value to the current staging. FF refers to the centralscar like area in an invasive tumor; and is surrounded by a highly cellular zone ofinfiltrating tumor cells. It is composed of fibroblasts and collagen fibers forming aradially expanding fibrosclerotic core; with an incidence of around 20%. The precisecomposition of the different components within FF may affect its prognostic value in breastcancer.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and collagen components are the most prominent featuresin FF. FF with proliferative CAF was associated with higher risk of metastasis. Moreover;CAFs identified by fibroblastic markers were correlated with breast cancer recurrence. Inbreast cancer; different subsets of CAF by differential fibroblastic markers have beencharacterized recently. They were present in varying proportions in breast cancer subtypesand conferred dissimilar impact on the immune tumor microenvironment (TME). Nonetheless; therelationship of CAF subtypes and FF and whether they will affect the FF prognostic impactremain elusive. Apart from CAF; the potent influence of collagen content in cancer isincreasingly appreciated. Collagen stroma can modulate immune TME by inhibiting CD8 Tlymphocytes infiltration. The expression of collagen and other extracellular matrixcomponents is prognostic in different types of cancer patients; including breast cancer. ForFF; detailed analysis on the collagen content is still lacking. The distinct collagencomposition and organization could also impact on the prognostic capabilities of FF. Theunderlying mechanisms for effects of FF are largely unknown. To date; there are very fewreports of molecular analysis of breast cancers with FF. FF has been associated withincreased angiogenesis; hypoxia markers expression and activation of hypoxia-induciblefactor-1Î± pathway; and concordantly increased tumor associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration.Exploration of other key biomarkers involved in will provide additional information on FFprognostication.In this proposal; a systemic evaluation on the FF features in breast cancers will beperformed. We aim to further characterize FF at different levels in detail. Finally; we planto develop prognostic model integrating the different FF features for a more accurate riskstratification.Study design To characterize FF based on morphologic; structural and molecular features Thedifferent morphologic features of FF will be examined and correlated with theclinico-pathologic parameters and breast cancer subtypes. To characterize the collagenstroma; the expression of these different collagens will be determined by IHC analysis. Thestructural characteristics of the collagen fibers will be determined on SHG signal and/orpico-Sirius red staining. The collagen composition and structural features in cases withdifferent FF morphological features will be compared.For the characterization of fibroblastic components; CAF populations will be determined byIHC analysis. Based on the reported CAF phenotypes; CAF markers will be examined on theconsecutive IHC slides. Co-expression of CAF markers will be evaluated using multiple IHCalignment. The relationship of CAF subpopulations on FF and collagen features as well asclinico-pathologic characteristics will be examined.The candidates from top differential genes and pathways implicated in FF will be examined.The candidates will be prioritized also based on survey of published literatures and theirbiological relevance.Hierarchical clustering analysis will be performed to classify FF based on the differentfeatures. The correlation of defined FF subsets and clinico-pathologic features will beinvestigated.To determine the impact of FF in immune TME To examine the effects of FF in the immune TME;we will investigate several immune cell populations in situ simultaneously using mIHC.Patients will be clustered based on their immune cell profiles. The immune cells density;their relative ratio; immune profile and spatial relationship with tumor cells will beassessed in relation to different FF features and compare between FF and non-FF cases. Theinterplay of immune features and FF in prognosis will be evaluated.To investigate the prognostic value of FF in breast cancer. Having examined theclinico-pathologic correlation of various features of FF and its relationship of tumor immuneenvironment; their prognostic value on overall survival; recurrence and metastasis will beanalyszd using the Kaplan-Meier method. Their prognostic impacts will be compared with eachother using univariate Cox proportional hazards model. Their independent prognostic valuewill be determined by multivariate analysis together with other conventional prognosticmarkers.

Radiation therapyuses high energy x-ray to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Androgens; or male sexhormones; can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs; such as apalutamide; may helpstop or reduce the growth of prostate cancer cell growth by blocking the attachment ofandrogen to its receptors on cancer cells; a mechanism similar to stopping the entrance of akey into its lock. Adding apalutamide to the usual hormone therapy and radiation therapyafter surgery may stabilize prostate cancer and prevent it from spreading and extend timewithout disease spreading compared to the usual approach.; <br><br>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:I. Compare metastasis-free survival (MFS) of salvage radiation therapy (RT) and gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) agonist/antagonist versus (vs.) RT/GnRH agonist/antagonist withapalutamide for patients with pathologic node-positive prostate cancer after radicalprostatectomy with detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA).<br><br>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I.

Mostchildren with moderate and severe TBI have long term sequelae including neurological deficit;cognitive impairment and behavioural disorders. In the acute care setting; neither cliniciansnor researchers are able to adequately predict the long term outcome of children with TBI;consequently limiting their ability to tailor medical care; rehabilitation and supportservices. Improving our understanding of a TBI patient's exact cerebral status and prognosisis a critical step toward optimized and personalized patient management. In this researchstudy; an innovative and integrated model will be developed to improve the prognostication inthe early phase of a TBI. This model will combine key clinical variables commonly collectedin the acute care setting and combine these with cutting-edge empirical measures: 1)biomarkers; 2) a new physiological monitoring based on heart-rate variability (HRV) to assessthe integrity of the autonomic system; and 3) a computerized classification tool developedusing the concept of artificial intelligence to continuously categorize the patient'scerebral status.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Not yet recruiting,NA,2019-11-06,2019-11-08,2019-11-07,Interventional,N/A,Other,Brain Injuries|Brain Injuries; Traumatic|Wounds and Injuries,outcome|paediatric critical care,Association with poor neurological outcome; A poor neurological outcome will be defined as on death or neurocognitive dysfunction in survivors,Adverse events; Adverse events will be defined as increased intracranial pressure; decreased cerebral perfusion pressure; seizure or cardiac arrest,1234,1234,1234,1234,8,11,2019,blah,1234,1234,1234

Sickness absence costs will be calculated based on data from the NAV registry<br><br>SUMMARY:Musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions are a leading cause of years lived with disability worldwideand for the last decade they have also been the most common cause of sickness absence anddisability pension in Norway.Although most sickness absence is short-termed; a small proportion of people with MSKconditions are on long-term sick leave; contributing to large cost due to disbursement ofbenefits; productivity loss and extensive use of health care. There is growing evidence thatlong-term sickness absence is harmful to mental and physical health; with a reducedprobability of return to work (RtW) with prolonged sickness absence. Thus; focusing on earlyRtW in people on sick leave due to MSK conditions is important to reduce the burden on boththe individual and the society. However; to provide interventions to reduce the duration ofsickness absence to all people on sick leave would require enormous resources. By targetingthose at risk of long-term sickness absence; resources may be used differently; e.g. moreresource-saving. By using information on modifiable risk factors from simple risk assessmenttools; health care providers and other stakeholders may facilitate RtW in a better way.The overall purposes of this project are 1) to identify the most accurate screening tool toidentify people at a high risk of prolonged sickness absence due to a MSK condition; and 2)to investigate severity of MSK health; health-related quality-of-life; health careconsumption; and costs across different risk profiles in people on sick leave due to MSKconditions. We will use registered data on sickness absence from 1 year before to 1 yearafter inclusion in the study.; Main aims are:-To compare the predictive ability of the STarT MSK tool and the Ã–MPSQ-SF; and otherestablished risk factors for long-term sickness absence (e.g. symptoms of depression andemotional distress; low motivation for returning to work; low self-efficacy; workexpectancies) for identifying prolonged sickness absence at 6- and 12-months follow-updue to MSK conditions-To develop a prognostic model to predict risk of prolonged sickness absence at 12-monthfollow-up in people with MSK conditions-To assess predictors for high costs (productivity loss and health care use) at 6- and12-months follow-up in people on sick leave due to MSK conditionsThe study will also include additional methodological and descriptive aims.Prior to the data collection we translated and culturally adapted the Keele STarT MSK andMSK-HQ following the Beaton guidelines.The study is conducted within the Norwegian Welfare and Labor Administration (NAV) system incollaboration with OsloMet - Oslo Metropolitan University. Data on sickness absence from theNAV registry will be retrieved prospectively in the period from study inclusion to 12 monthsfollow-up; and retrospectively 12 months prior to inclusion in the study.Previous studies show that 30-40% of people with MSK conditions have not RtW after 3 to 12months.

Numerous parameters such as demographic; clinical andfunctional factors drive the deterioration of the kidney; ultimately leading to ESRD.Although some ESRD prediction models have been derived in the past years; none of thesemodels are dynamic: they do not integrate the repeated measurements recorded throughoutindividuals' follow-up.As highlighted in several studies; kidney function repeated measurements (i.e.; trajectories)are highly associated with graft survival after kidney transplantation. The investigatorsmade the hypothesis that these trajectories may bring relevant information in the context ofgraft survival risk prediction model. Hence; combining these trajectories with standard graftsurvival risk factors may enhance prediction performance. This could permit to derive arobust tool that could be updated over time by continuously capturing patient' personalevolution.; 850 million individuals suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD); while diabetes; cancer; andHIV/AIDS affect 422; 42; and 37 million individuals; respectively. End stage renal disease(ESRD) hence places a heavy burden on health systems worldwide. Linked to that; thekidney-disease-associated mortality rate worldwide has risen over the past decade; nowcausing the death of 5 to 10 million individuals every year.In kidney transplantation; numerous parameters such as demographic; clinical and functionalfactors drive the deterioration of the kidney; sometimes leading to graft failure. Currentapproaches for investigating the relationship between these factors and graft failure havebeen limited by standard statistical approaches and by registries with an overall lack ongranular data; including infrequent kidney function measurements for a single patient andconvenience clinical samples.

Toreach this; three groups will be involved in the study.Provider Focus Group (n = 40):Following obtaining their agreement to participate; the Providers will be given a date; time;and venue for his/her participation in the focus group and will meet for one hour. An agendaand script for the conduct of the focus group session will be developed by a trainedmoderator. The focus groups will be conducted by a member of the research team. Data from thefocus group sessions will be analyzed and used to evaluate clinicians' interpretation ofpatient-reported outcomes (PROs) and acceptability of PRO data in routine clinical care. Aformal provider training program will be designed and implemented by a subject matter expert.The focus group session will be repeated at 12 months; with the 12 month administrationhaving an increased emphasis on barriers; facilitators; and value of PROs in clinical care.Patient Interview Group (n = 100):Following obtaining agreement to be interviewed; a trained professional interviewer willconduct a one-time; one-hour; semi-structured telephone interview of each subject to betterunderstand patient experiences with HF; the treatment process and quality of lifedeterminants. Two semistructured interviews will be conducted with the first 30 patients whohave had left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy (of the 100 patients who agreed to beinterviewed); before and 12 months after device implantation. The goal of these interviewswill be to describe patient experiences with LVAD therapy; examine factors influencingquality of life; and determine whether currently available PRO tools are likely to capturethe intended experiences in HF as they relate to LVAD therapy.PROs/Clinical Data Integration Group (n = 3500):The patients' electronic medical records will be reviewed and protocol-required informationwill be obtained. PRO capture will be expanded in a large population of patients across thecontinuum of HF patients. A plan has been developed that will integrate PRO scores into theirmedical records. Information will be obtained from 2 instruments (Kansas City CardiomyopathyQuestionnaire (KCCQ12) and NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System(PROMIS)) that are routinely administered as part standard of care. PRO and clinical datawill be obtained from electronic medical records of patients seen in the heart failure clinicduring the study period. Patient information will be stored in a secure research database.The data will be used to build prognostic models of 1-year survival with favorable quality oflife in patients with various forms of heart failure.No follow-up visits will be required for the PROs/Clinical Data Integration Group. Allprotocol-required information will be obtained from the subjects' electronic medical recordsover a period of 3.5 years after enrollment into the study.Biologic Determinants of Patient Health Status in HF (n = 1000):Subjects in the Integration Group that meet the inclusion criteria for this subject subsetwill be contacted in person by the Principal Investigator or his/her delegate. Subjects willbe asked if they are willing to provide their blood samples.Blood samples will be obtained approximately every six months for the duration of the study(i.e.; about 4 years). Approximately 40 ml (or 2.71 tablespoons) of venous blood will beobtained on each scheduled blood draw.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Enrolling by invitation,NA,2020-02-07,2020-02-11,2021-04-01,Observational,NA,NA,Heart Failure,NA,Time necessary for PRO completion by patients.

The diseases caused bySARS-CoV-2 is COVID-19. As of March 8; 2020; more than 100 000 COVID-19 patients have beenreported globally (more than 80 000 cases in China; more than 20 000 in other countries); and3 600 patients (3 100 in China; 500 outside of China) have died. The outbreak of COVID-19constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.Among COVID-19 patients; around 80% are mild (non-severe) illness patients; who usually healwithin two weeks. However; another 20% of patients may aggravate into a severe or criticalillness which results in a longer hospital stay; and the mortality rate for such patients is13.4%. Therefore; inchoate identification of the high-risk severe patients is extremelyimportant for patient management and medical resource allocation. General quarantine andsymptomatic treatment can be used for most non-severe patients; while a higher level of careand green channel to the intensive care unit (ICU) are helpful for severe patients. Previousstudies have summarized the clinical and radiological characteristics of severe COVID-19patients; while which factors are important predictors is still unclear.Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables us to learn knowledgeand potential laws from the given data and to build a model for solving problems as humanneeds. In recent years; machine learning has been developed as a novel tool to analyze largeamounts of data from medical records or images. Previous modeling studies focused onforecasting the potential international spread of COVID-19.Therefore; our purpose is to develop and validate a machine-learning model based on clinical;laboratory; and radiological characteristics alone or combination of COVID-19 patients in theearly stage without severe illness from multiple centers for the prediction of severe (orcritical) illness in the following hospitalization to facilitate risk Assessment before andafter symptoms and triage (home; hospitalization inward or ICU).,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2020-04-06,2020-04-07,2020-04-06,Observational,NA,NA,Coronavirus Infections,NA,Predictive performance; AUC; accuracy; sensitivity; and specificity,; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,7,4,2020,blah,1234,1234,1234

Recent case series reported the use of HyperbaricOxygen Therapy (HBOT) on 5 severe COVID-19 patients who developed respiratory insufficiency.HBOT mechanisms of tissue oxygenation and anti-inflammatory effect may explain thesefindings.The purpose of the current study is the evaluate the efficacy of HBOT in moderate-severeCOVID-19 patients in a randomized controlled manner.; The 2019-20 coronavirus disease; caused by COVID-19; is an ongoing pandemic. The outbreakstarted in Wuhan; Hubei province; China; in December 2019 and the World Health Organization(WHO) recognized it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Up to Apr 9. 2020 there are more than 2million confirmed cases; and over 140;000 deaths. In Israel; COVID-19 was confirmed in more12;000 cases and took the life of 140 victims. There are 323 mild admitted cases; 170moderate admitted cases and 170 severe admitted cases (16.04.2020) .Even though the general mortality rate is low (0.2-7%; country based); patients who developAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have a significantly higher mortality rate; up to61-90%. COVID-19 ARDS is different; causing a rapidly progressive disease includingrespiratory insufficiency and pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism behind isn't clear yet; butevidence points to the direction of an acute cytokines storm which include: IL-2; IL-7; GCSF;InterferonGamma; TNF-alpha; Macrophage chemoattractant protein . Poor prognosis include highlevels of IL-6 and Ferritin.More than 160 clinical trials have been registered; but as of April 2020; there is no proveneffective treatment.The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) includes breathing 100% oxygen in pressureshigher than 1 absolute atmospheres (ATA); increasing the amount of oxygen dissolved in theplasma and the different tissues. In the last month; Chen et al. reported a case series of 5severe COVID-19 patients treated with 3-8 HBOT sessions in addition to the standard therapy.In all cases; they reported an increase in oxygen saturation; arterial oxygen content;lactatelevels reduction;fibrinogen levels decrease and increase in lymphocytes number.In addition;the patients chest CT showed improved signs. Symptomatic relief started following the 2ndsession. No significant adverse events were reported.These findings may be explained by the known physiological effects of HBOT; related to theSARS-CoV-2 virus pathogenesis:1. Increased competitive binding of oxygen to the hemoglobin molecule - it has beenpostulated recently the SARS-CoV-2 bind to the heme component in the hemoglobin moleculeand reduces the oxygen affinity to hemoglobin. During HBOT; the increased amount ofavailable oxygen molecules increases the binding to the hemoglobin molecules. This hasshown significant beneficial effects in cases of another competitive molecule such ascarbon monoxide intoxication.2. Tissue oxygenation - The oxygen content in the different tissues is multiplied by 25-30times. This effect has two therapeutic aspects: First; overcoming pulmonary hypoxia(either shunt or VQ mismatch) by increasing the FiO2 significantly. By increasing thepulmonary oxygen gradient; oxygen diffusion increases and can overcome the inflammationin the alveoli and the thickened fibrosis caused by ARDS. Second; during HBOT; theamount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma becomes significant and enables tissueoxygenation without the need of red blood cells.3. Anti inflammatory - HBOT reduces the following inflammatory cytokines both in theprotein level and genes expression (mRNA): IL-2; TNF-alpha; IL-6; IL-1beta. Theanti-inflammatory effect has been shown in chronic diseases as well as models of acuteinfection and massive hemorrhage.The purpose of the current study is the evaluate the efficacy of HBOT in moderate-severeCOVID-19 patients in a randomized controlled manner.ProtocolDue to the national IRB requirements the protocol includes 2 phases:The first phase includes 5 patients who following signing an informed consent will be treatedwith 8 sessions of HBOT ; 2 sessions per day; in 4 consecutive days. During the sessions; thesymptoms and vitals will be monitored. 1 day following the last session; revaluation will beperformed.The second phase will include 24 patients; who following signing an informed consent; will berandomized 2:1 to hyperbaric oxygen therapy group and standard of care control group.Following the randomization the patients will undergo baseline evaluation including symptoms;vitals; pulmonary function and blood tests The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure(PaO2 in mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen at 5 days after enrollment was determined as theprimary endpoint of the study. However; the ability to draw arterial blood gases with fullCOVID-19 protection gear was found to be challenging; more than usual inconvenient to thepatients and many of the patients asked to avoid it (especially the draw of second arterialblood gas). Therefore; this endpoint was not completed and changed from the originalprotocol.. The HBOT group patients will undergo 8 sessions of either hyperbaric oxygen therapy; 2sessions per day; in 4 consecutive days. During the sessions; the symptoms and vitals will bemonitored. 1 day following the last session; revaluation will be performed.The control group will continue standard of care and undergo similar vitals and symptomsmonitoring. 5 days after baseline evaluation; revaluation will be performed.The long 30 days outcomes of both groups will be collected.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2020-04-21,2020-04-24,2021-02-01,Interventional,Randomized,Treatment,COVID-19,NA,SpO2.

Two cohorts will be defined: the 'pandemic'cohort; which will include all patients [COVID-19-positive or negative] operated on foremergency digestive pathology during the months of March to June 2020; and the controlcohort; which will include all patients operated on for emergency digestive pathology duringthe months of March to June 2019.Information will be gathered on demographic characteristics; clinical and analyticalparameters; scores on the usual risk scales for quality management in a General Surgeryservice (POSSUM; P-POSSUM and LUCENTUM scores); prognostic factors applicable to allpatients; specific factors for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; complications andpostoperative mortality (at 30 and 90 postoperative days). In the pandemic cohort it will bedetailed whether or not the patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2.The main objective will be to determine the incidence of postoperative complications andmortality. This variable will be analysed in the full analysis set population. Secondaryobjective will be to develop a specific postoperative risk propensity model for SARS-CoV-2infected patients.; COVIDCIR is an observational; multicenter; cohorts' study of patients undergoingemergency/urgent gastrointestinal surgery during the period of maximum impact of the COVID-19pandemic in Spain (from March 1st to June 30th; 2020).The study conforms to the stipulations of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol wasapproved by the local Institutional Review Board (Ethics and Clinical InvestigationCommittee) and a waiver for written informed consent was given. The level of protection ofconfidentiality; in terms of protection of personal data as required by Spanish Law (LOPD3/2018); was also ensured.A total of 30 surgical teams from different Spanish hospitals have been proposed asparticipants in this study; which has been coordinated by the Department of General andDigestive Surgery of Bellvitge University Hospital (L'Hospitalet del Llobregat; Barcelona;Spain). All hospitals participating are from Spain; with different surgical capabilities.Patients operated on for emergency/urgent gastrointestinal surgery constitute the targetpopulation.Inclusion criteria: â‰¥18 years; both genders; and operated on for urgent/emergencygastrointestinal pathology.Exclusion criteria: patients who have undergone a scheduled surgical intervention or patientsoperated on by a service other than General and Digestive Surgery.Three cohorts will be defined:Cohort 1: Covid-19-positive (infected by SARS-CoV-2) patients who required emergency/urgentgastrointestinal surgery from March 1st to June 30th; 2020 Cohort 2: Covid-19-negative (notinfected by SARS-CoV-2)patients who required emergency/urgent gastrointestinal surgery fromMarch 1st to June 30th; 2020.Cohort 3: Consecutive patients who required emergency/urgent gastrointestinal surgery fromMarch 1st to June 30th; 2019 (control cohort of a pre-pandemic period; all patientsCovid-19-negative).Primary outcome is 30-day postoperative mortality. Secondary variables are 90-day mortality;postoperative complications; severa complications (graded as Clavien-Dindo score >= IIIA);and length of stay.Main variables related to postoperative mortality and complications will be: Age;comorbidities; ASA score; type of surgical pathology; type of performed surgery; POSSUMscore; P-POSSUM score; LUCENTUM score and specific analitic parameters for Covid-19 patients.Baseline characteristics will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics; and adescriptive and exploratory comparative analysis between cohorts will be carried out.The cumulative incidence of mortality (and its 95% confident interval) and the incidence ofmorbidity (and its 95% confident interval) at 30 and 90 days will be estimated by SARS-CoV-2infection status (cohort 1) and in the control groups (cohorts 2 and 3).To minimize the selection bias effect of potential confounders; propensity scores will beestimated using a multinomial model to estimate the probability that subjects wereSARS-CoV-2-positive; SARS-CoV-2-negative. Then; subjects will be matched using the propensityscore. After matching; to identify imbalance between groups; the standardized mean differencewill be estimated and plotted. In the matched sample; the cumulative incidence of mortality(and its 95% confidence interval) and the incidence of morbidity (and its 95% confidenceinterval) at 30 and 90 days will be compared using a generalized linear model with a binomialdistribution and a logarithm link function. Those variables that remain imbalance betweengroups after matching would be added to the model with an adjusting purpose.A generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and a logarithm link function will beused to estimate relative risk as a measure to indentify prognostic factors associated with30 and 90 days mortality and morbidity incidences. Five predictive scores of postoperativecomplications and/or mortality will be calculated: POSSUM-mortality; POSSUM-complications;P-POSSUM; LUCENTUM-logistic regression and LUCENTUM-CHAID.

All patients scheduled for open heart surgery in Fayoum university hospital startingfrom August 2020 will be enrolled in this prospective observational study until fulfillingsample size. A detailed informed consent will be signed by the eligible participants beforerecruitment ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE All patients will be preoperatively assessed andinvestigated by complete blood count; coagulation profile; Liver and kidney functions andserum electrolytes. Chest X-ray; Electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography will beroutinely done. Coronary angiography and carotid arterial duplex will be requested if needed.Patient will be premedicated by 10 mg morphine intramuscularly at morning of the operation.Prior to induction of anesthesia; standard monitoring will be applied including a five-leadelectrocardiography system; a pulse oximeter probe. A peripheral intravenous (IV) cannulawill be placed. An arterial will be inserted using a 20 G cannula either right or left radialartery under local anesthesia. After pre-oxygenation; general anesthesia will be inducedusing midazolam 2-5 mg; fentanyl (3-10 Î¼g/kg); propofol (1-1.5 mg/Kg); followed by atracurium(0.5 mg/kg).After trachea intubation; patients will be mechanically ventilated with oxygen in air so asto achieve normocarbia. A main stream capnogram; an esophageal temperature probe and a Foleycatheter will also be placed. A triple-lumen central venous catheter will be placed usuallythrough the right internal jugular vein.Maintenance of anesthesia will be achieved by inhaled Isoflurane 0.4 to 1% and atracuriuminfusion at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/h. After initiating extracorporeal circulation; Propofolinfusion at a rate of 50-100 Âµg/kg/min will be added to replace isoflurane inhalation.Patients will receive intravenous heparin (300-500 IU/kg body weight) before the initiationof cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of more than 480seconds. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted with the use of a non-pulsatile blood flow at2.4 L/min/m2; a non-heparin-coated circuit; and a membrane oxygenator. Mean arterial pressurewill be adjusted to exceed 60mmHg before; during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) .Cardiac arrest will be induced using St Thomas crystalloid solution (Hamburg). LactatedRinger's solution will be added to the CPB circuit to maintain reservoir volume if needed;and packed red blood cells will be infused when hemoglobin level drops to less than 7g/dl.After rewarming the patient to 37Â°C and weaning from CPB; Protamine sulfate will be used toreverse the effect of heparin.After skin closure and wound dressing; patients will be transferred to the intensive careunit intubated with manual ventilation and full monitoring during transfer.Intensive care Tracheal extubation will be performed when the patient meets the followingcriteria: awake or arousable; hemodynamically stable; no ongoing active bleeding; warmextremities; no electrolyte abnormalities; no or minimal inotropic support and a satisfactoryarterial blood gas with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) < 0.5; Ventilator pressuresupport reduced to 10 CmH2O with Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) 5-7 CmH2O.ICU management and decisions will be left to the intensivist who is responsible of thepostoperative cardiac critical care.Patient will be discharged from ICU when the following criteria are met: Awake patient withoxygen saturation (SpO2) < 90% at FIO2 > 0.5 by facemask; adequate cardiac stability; nointravenous inotropic or vasopressor supportive therapy; no hemodynamically significantarrhythmia; not dependent on epicardial external pacing no major bleeding i.e. chest tubedrainage less than 50 ml/h; urine output of more than 0.5 ml/kg/h and no vital threats toother organ systems such as kidneys and liver.Lung Ultrasound scan (LUS) All patients will be examined at 12 hours postoperatively as perour institution routine using a convex ultrasound probe; any other LUS will be done upondemand.LUS will be performed by an experienced radiologist according to standardized protocols.This will be used to calculate total LUS-score (calculated as a sum of all quadrants score)and individual areas score.Sample size was calculated using (G power). Minimal sample size of patients was 191 needed toget power level 0.80; alpha level 0.05 (two tailed) and 0.20 as expected Î² (slope ofregression line) for predicting intensive care Length of stay .Data management will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version22.0; SPSS Inc.; Chicago; IL; USA). Descriptive statistics (mean; standard deviation forquantitative data; and number and percentages for qualitative data) will be used to summarizethe data.

Pregnancy and the postpartumperiod are associated with unique changes in the immune system that may impact the naturalhistory of autoimmune diseases and immune-mediated infections. In the postpartum period. ALTï¬‚ares have been reported in 20%-60% of untreated women and were more likely to occur inhepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients. It has been postulated that postpartum ALTï¬‚ares may arise to rapid immune restitution against hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens in theliver; when may be a timing of antiviral treatment. A large number of previous studies havefocused on studies on the interruption of mother-to-child transmission in women with chronichepatitis B(CHB); but studies on the prognosis of mothers undergoing pregnancy and deliveryare very limited. What are the factors that affect the clearance of HBeAg or HBsAg? What kindof antiviral treatment protocol should be adopted for mothers with CHB? It is not only aproblem that needs to be solved urgently in clinical practice; but also can provide someclues for understanding the occurrence and development of HBV infection in women ofchildbearing age.Overall; this study intends to carry out a multi-center two-way cohort study on Eantigen-positive CHB women in 9 hospitals in Shaanxi Province.

The EBI scoring system is used to stage disease severity in these subjects. Min=0; max= 80; higher scores refer to higher severity of eczema<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Inflammatory skin disorders are usually assessed by disease scoring system such as Scoring AD(SCORAD)/Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)for atopic eczema and psoriasis respectively. The current approach to score the severity ofthese inflammatory skin disorders is through clinical observations and questionnaires. Thesescores however do not reflect the structural characteristics of the skin such as morphology;vasculature architecture and dermis thickness and are subject to inter and intra-assessorvariability. Objective inflammatory diseases indicators through non-invasive imagingtechniques have the potential to be an important clinical tool to shed light on its severityin an objective manner. Furthermore; given the abundance of cutaneous vasculature;non-invasive imaging in patients with chronic inflammatory skin conditions allows theinvestigators to evaluate in detail how co-morbidities of metabolic syndrome; especially type2 diabetes; further affects the vasculature or the epidermis in the skin. It helps to answerthe question of whether a tighter control of the overlying skin condition helps inmanagement of the underlying co-morbidities.Currently; there are many skin imaging modalities available to visualize the morphology andvascular architecture non-invasively; but they are hindered by their penetration depth andlack of contrast. Examples include optical coherence tomography (OCT); high-frequencyultrasound; and Doppler based ultrasound. In this study; these shortcomings will becircumvented through the usage of photoacoustic mesoscopic imaging; a non-invasive; highresolution; intrinsic or contrast-enhanced imaging technique; which can provide functionaland metabolic information at greater depths; and an optical fibre-based handheld confocalRaman spectroscopy system with inbuilt data processing algorithms and software; which allowsfor highly effective and accurate analysis of various skin constituents; such as ceramides;filaggrin; and hydration. These technologies will allow the investigators to studyinflammatory and skin barrier markers in; as well as correlations between; psoriasis; eczema;diabetes; and obesity. In addition; by studying the skin before and after therapeuticinterventions; this study will aid in understanding the mechanisms of action and efficacy ofvarious interventions.; Inflammatory skin diseases are increasingly common in various industrialized westernsocieties. In 2015; eczema or dermatitis; the most common inflammatory skin disease; isestimated to have affected 245 million people worldwide. In fact; the biggest percentage ofcases seen in National Skin Centre (NSC); Singapore is for dermatitis (34.1%) while otherinflammatory skin diseases such as contact dermatitis and psoriasis account for 4.7% and 3.3%of the cases respectively. Inflammatory skin diseases can cause remodeling of thevasculature. This vascular remodeling is brought about by the imbalance between pro- andanti-angiogenic mediators under conditions of chronic inflammation; resulting in eithervessel growth or recession. Vascular remodeling of affected skin usually display vascularenlargement during inflammation. In psoriasis; for example; the skin capillaries expand andbecome tortuous; making the lesions appear red due to the thinned epithelium.Emerging evidence reports that chronic inflammatory skin diseases are closely related tosystemic complications such as atherosclerosis; type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome due tosystemic inflammation. One possible theory linking cutaneous and systemic vascular diseasesis from the release of products such as inflammatory cytokines produced in affected skinlesions into the systemic circulation; resulting in the increased risk of inflammation inother organs or tissues. It was reported that individuals with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) in theadult US population tend to have a self-reported history of hypertension and adult-onsetdiabetes even with control of body mass index and other comorbidities. An analysis ofdifferent studies indicated that both individuals from Asia and North America with pediatricand adult-onset of AD have a higher chance of being overweight; which can lead to othermetabolic diseases. It was also reported that there is an increased number of inflammatorycells around vessels seen in histopathology biopsies of the human forearm skin for diabeticpatients compared to non-diabetic populations. The density of vascular network also tended tobe higher in diabetic patients in the forearms compared to non-diabetic subjects. However; nodifference in vascular networks were observed between subjects with Type 1 and Type 2diabetes. The mechanism to explain the increased vessel density in diabetic subjects is notknown; though inflammation plays a role due to the presence of inflammatory cells. Sinceinflammatory skin diseases are systemic disorders due to the co-morbidities; it would shedlight on the understanding of these diseases and their linkages to metabolic disease such asdiabetes.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Recruiting,NA,2021-03-15,2021-03-22,2021-03-18,Interventional,N/A,Diagnostic,Psoriasis,NA,Quantify various photoacoustic imaging based parameter variations characterising psoriasis; eczema; and diabetes mellitus (total blood volume; epidermis thickness; size of vessels).

Theinvestigators will employ rapid-cycle approaches to optimize the framing of nudges toclinicians and patients prior to initiating the trial and mixed methods to explore contextualfactors and mechanisms.The investigators will conduct a four-arm pragmatic cluster randomize clinical trial to testthe effectiveness of nudges to clinicians; nudges to patients; or nudges to both inincreasing the frequency and timeliness of SIC documentation in cancer patients vs. usualcare (UC). The investigators hypothesize that each of the implementation strategy arms willsignificantly increase SIC documentation compared to UC and that the combination of nudges toclinicians and to patients will be the most effective.; Patients with cancer often experience physical and emotional distress; utilize unplannedacute care; and undergo medical interventions that are discordant with their wishes. Giventhe COVID-19 pandemic; these adverse outcomes are amplified; particularly for racial/ethnicminorities. Serious illness conversations (SICs) that elicit patients' values; goals; andcare preferences; particularly early in the disease trajectory; are an evidence-basedpractice; improve patient mood and quality of life; and are recommended by nationalguidelines. Preliminary data suggests that SICs among patients with cancer are associatedwith improved quality of life; increased hospice utilization; and decreased acute careutilization. However; most patients with advanced cancer die without a documented SIC andthere are well-documented health disparities in implementation for racial and ethnicminorities. Current strategies to promote SICs; including the multi-component strategies ofthe Serious Illness Conversation Program; focus primarily on clinician education and havemarginally increased the timeliness and frequency of SICs and reduced patient anxiety anddepression. While core elements of this program are transferable-such as its structuredguide-clinical use remains low. For example; even after training; clinicians at Penn Medicinedocument SICs for fewer than 5% of patients with advanced cancer. There is critical need todevelop; test; and disseminate strategies to improve the frequency of SICs.Implementation strategies informed by behavioral economics are ideally suited to address thisproblem; which is fundamentally one of clinician and patient behavior change. Clinicianbarriers to initiating SICs include optimism bias; or the belief that one's own patient isunlikely to experience a negative event; uncertainty about prognosis and appropriate timing;and fear that bringing up end-of-life issues may be distressing to patients. Patient barriersto SIC initiation include fear of discussing the end of life and beliefs that SICs are notappropriate until late in the course of cancer. While previous studies have tested financialincentives for SIC documentation; little research has evaluated behavioral economics-informedstrategies to align both clinicians and patients towards earlier SICs.By intentionally modifying the way choices are framed; behavioral nudges can lead todesirable changes in clinician behavior while preserving clinician choice. The investigators'preliminary work demonstrates the effectiveness of an implementation strategy focusing on aclinician nudge; consisting of performance feedback and targeted text messages identifyingpatients at high risk of mortality based on a validated machine learning prognosticalgorithm. This strategy led to a threefold increase in SIC documentation for high-riskpatients; equitably across racial/ethnic minority subgroups; and is now in routine use acrossPenn Medicine practice sites. However; clinicians still did not document SICs for over halfof patients; illustrating the limitations of a clinician-directed implementation strategyalone.This study will expand on these preliminary findings to evaluate the synergy betweenclinician- and patient-directed nudges to increase SIC documentation. The main purpose ofthis research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of nudges to clinicians; to patients; orto both in increasing Serious Illness Conversation (SIC) documentation; and to identifymoderators of implementation effects on SIC documentation. The investigators will employrapid-cycle approaches to optimize the framing of nudges to clinicians and patients prior toinitiating the trial and mixed methods to explore contextual factors and mechanisms. Theinvestigators will conduct a four-arm pragmatic cluster randomize clinical trial to test theeffectiveness of nudges to clinicians; nudges to patients; or nudges to both in increasingthe frequency and timeliness of SIC documentation in cancer patients vs. usual care (UC).Rationale for clinician nudge using mortality prediction and peer comparison: Due to optimismbias; clinicians routinely overestimate the life expectancy of patients with advanced cancerand delay SICs until too late in the disease course. In part because of this; cliniciansreinforce a social norm that early SICs are not part of routine oncology care. Providing anobjective assessment of predicted mortality risk may help counteract optimism bias amongclinicians and help them identify patients most likely to benefit from SICs. Moreover; thatindividuals desire to conform to an approved behavior (an injunctive norm) and the behaviorof others (a descriptive norm) may contribute to low observed SIC rates; and may also affordan opportunity for intervention. The investigators expect that periodically remindingclinicians of their own performance on SIC documentation; while providing both an injunctivenorm (citing national and institutional guidelines) and a descriptive social norm (displayingthe behavior of their best performing peers); will lead clinicians to conform more closely tothese norms; as has been shown in studies conducted in other contexts.Rationale for patient nudge using priming: Priming is a type of nudge that frames informationto activate one's self-efficacy and willingness to engage in behavior change. This type ofnudge has not previously been evaluated as a tool to promote SICs for patients with cancer.The investigators will test the added impact of a patient nudge designed to prime patientsand; in turn; their clinicians to having a SIC.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2021-04-27,2021-04-30,2021-09-10,Interventional,Randomized,Health Services Research,NA,Cancer|Serious Illness Conversation|Machine Learning|Behavioral Economics,SIC Documentation - High Risk Patients; Measured at the patient level as a binary outcome (yes/no) among high-risk patients based on date of documented note including the SIC template in the Advanced Care Planning (ACP) section of the electronic medical record by any provider,SIC Documentation - All Patients Palliative Care Referral - High Risk Patients Aggressive End-Of-Life Care - Decedent High Risk Patients; Measured at the patient level as a binary outcome (yes/no) among all cancer patients based on date of documented note including the SIC template in the Advanced Care Planning (ACP) section of the electronic medical record by any provider Measured at the patient level as a binary outcome (yes/no) among high-risk patients based on presence of a scheduled palliative care appointment Measured at the patient level as a binary outcome (yes/no) among high-risk patients who die based on the presence of any of the following three criteria: chemotherapy within 14 days before death; hospitalization within 30 days before death; or admission to hospice 3 days or less before death,1234,1234,1234,1234,30,4,2021,blah,1234,1234,1234

Collected data involves postoperative complications of thecentral nervous system; cardiovascular system; kidney; respiratory system; infection; pain;and other perioperative complications. Based on the database; the investigators intend toexplore:-The incidence and risk factors of perioperative morbidity and mortality in elderlypatients;-Perioperative risk assessment methods and early warning models for elderly patients;-Practical; safe; and effective risk prevention and control system through subsequentstudies.; As the population aging is speeding up; senile diseases have become a significant and severepublic health problem; influencing national health. More than 20 million elderly patientsundergo surgery each year in China; accounting for a quarter of the population who undergosurgery. Advanced age and comorbid diseases render the elderly at increased risk ofpostoperative morbidity and mortality. The incidence of postoperative complications is twiceas non-elderly patients; and mortality rates are five times higher than non-elderly patients.Thus; it is a significant challenge to safely and stably ensure the elderly in an optimalperioperative period.For the good of optimizing perioperative management; it is urgent to build a large-sample;multi-center database. Based on this database; the investigators can explore new riskassessment methods and establish a perioperative risk prediction model and early warningsystem suitable for elderly patients. It will help improve this group of patients' short- andlong-term outcomes and thus reduce the economic burden of national health and medicalresources.In this context; establishing a clinical database including data for all perioperativeelderly patients is of high interest. This database will allow the investigators to carry outclinical researches on:-Clinical; biological; and genetic factors predictive of perioperative complications anddeaths;-Systematic and individualized evaluation tools for elderly patients;-Prognostic factors for improving short- and long-term outcomes. This is particularlysignificant for rare clinical evidence of perioperative elderly patients for which thecurrent knowledge is scarce.The database will also allow the investigators to develop or participate in multi-centertrials; national or international; and facilitate the formation of perioperative datacollection standards.In the construction of the database; the investigators will build a four-level qualitycontrol system:-Primary self-check including manual check and system self-check (automatic check andabnormal data reminder);-In secondary supervision; data management will carry out real-time monitoring andverification by tests and scrutiny to ensure the quality of the database;-In third-level inspection; Clinical Research Associate (CRA) is initiated to conduct aregular review into the database;-In the four-level inspection; the expert steering group will conduct a regular surveyfor follow-up and data entry quality and progress.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2021-03-28,2021-06-03,2021-06-02,Observational,NA,NA,NA,central nervous system complications|heart injury|acute kidney injury|lung injury|infection|pain,the incidence of postoperative complications; including central nervous system injury; heart injury; acute kidney injury; lung injury; infection; and pain; collection of clinical data in the medical record and follow-up update,the incidence of survival rate; collection of clinical data in the medical record and follow-up update,1234,1234,1234,1234,3,6,2021,blah,1234,1234,1234

It can be usedfor disease classification; disease severity grading; genetic testing; image analysis;adjuvant treatment recommendations; and predicting patient prognosis. Because sublingualmicrocirculation can be used for guiding shock resuscitation; a real time automated analysisis required for rapid changes of clinical condition. This study aims to use machine learningto analyze the parameters and patterns of sublingual microcirculation.; The sublingual microcirculation videos are extracted from the 11 clinical trials conductingin the National Taiwan University Hospital.In the first stage; the microcirculation videos and the related information are included in ade-identified manner. Each microcirculation video in the database will have a unique code.The video-related data will include the patient's height; weight; blood pressure; heartbeats;health status; major diseases; laboratory examination values; video quality description;automated vascular analysis (AVA) 3 software analysis results including total vessel density(TVD); perfused vessel density (PVD); proportion of perfused vessels (PPV); microvascularflow index (MFI); and heterogeneity index (HI). The length of each micro-cycle video is 4-6seconds; and there are 25 frames per second. Take a picture as a representative image; eachvideo can correspond to 4 images; and each micro-circulation image will also be marked withits image quality. Machine learning model will be trained for distinguishing the quality ofvideos and images. Only good-quality videos and images will be used for further analysis.In the second stage; 80% of the microcirculation videos and images will be used for trainingand validation to find the best model; and then the remaining 20% of microcirculation videosand images will be used to test the model performance. The first training purpose is toautomatically distinguish the size of blood vessels; calculate TVD; and draw a histogram ofthe number of microvessels of different diameters. The second training purpose is to measurethe blood flow velocity in each small vessel and calculate PVD; MFI; and HI values.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Recruiting,NA,2021-06-23,2021-07-12,2021-06-30,Observational,NA,NA,NA,NA,Perfused vessel density; Training machine learning models to view the videos of patients' sublingual microcirculation images and calculate the perfused vessel density.

Sex-specific data focused on cardiovascular disease have beenincreasing steadily; yet is not the subgroup of young women. This study focuses on classicaland novel risk factors of cardiovascular disease in young women compared with older women.; This is the introduction of a new study at Istishari entitled: The Classical Risk Factors inYoung Middle Eastern Women with Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease This is aninvestigator-initiated; cross-sectional; non-interventional; observational study.Medical research in Jordan is a basic responsibility of all medical sectors in the country.Despite the drastic growth and advances of medical services; the volume of the local medicalresearch is; at best estimate; scarce. The emerging role of private medical groups; privatehospitals; and residency programs in cooperation with other medical sectors and medicalschools; in conducting; presenting; and publishing such studies should be encouraged andsupported. A major indicator of judging the credibility and quality of any medical researchproject is to look at the conferences the research was presented at and the journals it waspublished in.This is the 10th major project of the Jordan Collaborating Cardiology Group (JCC) and thefirst in cooperation with the Istishari Hospital Internal Medicine Residency Program (seeAppendix 1. Timeline of JCC Group studies) The first project was JoHARTS that evaluatedcoronary risk factors and dyslipidemia in 5000 individuals with ACS; stable CAD; and non CADpatients. The 2nd project was CAPRIS evaluated the prognostic implications of hs-CRP in ACSfrom admission to 1 year. The 3rd project was MINTOR that evaluated onset; triggers;reperfusion strategies; and hospital mortality in more than 950 Jordanians with acuteST-elevation MI. The 4th project was GLORY study that evaluated the prevalence ofglucometabolic states among ACS patients; prognosis up to 1 year; and TIMI risk score . The5th was JoPCR1 that evaluated outcome post PCI in 2426 ACS and non ACS patients in 12tertiary care centers for the incidence of death; stent thrombosis; revascularization;bleeding; impact of gender; DM; renal dysfunction; and age on outcome; GRACE; and CRUSADErisk scores. The 6th is the colchicine study of AF prevention in open heart surgery; one iscompleted with 1 mg dose and one is ongoing with reduced dose. The 7th and 8th projects areongoing and study statin eligibility in patients admitted with MI (Statin EPIC) and decade ormore survivors after coronary revascularization. The 8th was the Jordanian AF study whichevaluated patients with AF in ambulatory and out-patient settings. The 9th was the JoCOREstudy that evaluated acute CV events due to the stresses of the covid-19 pandemic.One population subgroup is under studied in the world literature as well as the localliterature.

Wound healing rates; Freedom from major limb amputation Freedom from any interventions to the index treated lesion Patency of the treated lesion at index procedure Healing of index wounds and whether there is any recurrence<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:There is no hard and fast rule guiding the clinical decision between angioplasty andamputation. As such; this decision is greatly dependant on each clinician's experience andpreference as to whether treatment should be conservative or aggressive.Angioplasty can help restore blood flow and long-term patency of the blood vessels can helpprevent major surgeries; such as amputation which affects patient's quality of life. However;some of these patients do not benefit from angioplasty and eventually had to undergoamputation. On the other hand; there are patients that undergo amputation; but may stand tobenefit from angioplasty. Hence; it is essential to identify patients that will likelybenefit from angioplasty to increase limb salvage rate. Many studies performed have alsoconcluded that before amputations are performed; surgeons should consider angioplastyprocedures.Through a medical record review of patients that have undergone angioplasty to evaluatepost-angioplasty outcomes; we hope to identify factors that potentially affects theseoutcomes. Ultimately with a better understanding of these factors and their impact onangioplasty outcomes; a predictive model or guideline can be developed to identify patientsthat stands to benefit from angioplasty. Such a model can help clinicians to better counselpatients on the risk and benefits; alternatives and prognosis. Patients can also make abetter informed decision regarding their treatment; ,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2021-08-22,2021-08-24,2021-08-22,Observational [Patient Registry],NA,NA,Peripheral Arterial Disease|Peripheral Vascular Diseases|Ischemia,NA,Amputation Free Survival.

Average Bp of greater than 140/90 will be taken as hypertensive.<br><br>SUMMARY:Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of morbidity; disability; mortality; and healthexpenditures worldwide. A wealth of studies has demonstrated that people of South Asianancestry have a higher risk of CHD and particularly premature CHD than most otherracial/ethnic groups; and recent research suggests that this risk is higher in Pakistanisthan in Indians-the two largest SA groups. Pakistan is the 5th most populous country in theworld; and despite these concerning trends; so far there has been a scarcity of large studiesevaluating the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical coronaryatherosclerosis in young-to-middle-aged Pakistanis. Also; there is currently nocardiovascular risk score specifically tailored to younger Pakistani men and women. ThePAKistan Study of prEmature coronary atHerosclerosis in young AdulTs (PAK-SEHAT) aims ataddressing these important gaps. PAK-SEHAT is an ongoing prospective cohort study that willenroll 2;000 asymptomatic Pakistani men aged 30 to 45 years and women aged 45 to 55 yearsfrom the general population; free of clinically overt cardiovascular disease. Participantswill undergo a comprehensive baseline exam including coronary computed tomographyangiography; and will be followed for incident events and repeat testing for 5 years.PAK-SEHAT will allow to determine the prevalence; severity; determinants; and prognosticsignificance of early atherosclerosis in apparently healthy young-to-middle-aged Pakistanis.This knowledge can help inform primordial and primary prevention strategies; enhancedcardiovascular risk stratification; and potential plaque-screening approaches in Pakistan;all of which can ultimately help reduce the burden of CHD in the country. In this reportinvestigators describe the rationale; objectives; methods; and discuss the potentialimplications of the PAK-SEHAT study.; Study Objectives The primary objectives of PAK-SEHAT are: 1) characterize the prevalence andseverity of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis among young-to-middle aged Pakistani men andwomen free of clinical CVD; and 2) understand the impact; in terms of 5-year rates of CVDevents; of using the prognostic information provided by CCTA and the other study tests andmeasurements to optimize cardiovascular prevention management in young-to-middle-agedPakistani adults.The secondary objectives of the study are to 1) determine the prevalence ofknown and unknown diabetes; hypertension; dyslipidemia; and other cardiovascular risk factorsamong young-to-middle aged Pakistani men and women free of clinical CVD; 2) identify thedeterminants of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in this population; 3) estimate theincidence of diabetes; hypertension; dyslipidemia; and other cardiovascular risk factors at 5years of follow-up; 4) identify independent risk factors and markers of incident clinical CVDamong young asymptomatic Pakistanis; and 5) develop a 5-year risk score for the prediction ofincident CVD events in young-to-middle-aged Pakistani men and women.Study Design PAK-SEHAT is an ongoing; observational; community-based; prospective cohortstudy; with a target study population of 2;000 participants and a planned prospective followup of 5 years after study enrollment.Study Population Investigators plan to recruit 2;000 young-to-middle aged adult Pakistani menand women with no known clinical ASCVD. Because the focus of this study is to investigate theprevalence; severity; and determinants of early coronary atherosclerosis in Pakistani adults;focus will be on apparently healthy (i.e.; without known clinical CVD) young-to-middle nativePakistanis. Also; because premature coronary events are more frequent and usually observed atyounger ages in men than in women; the age range of male participants at enrollment will be30-45 years; while this will be 45-55 years for female participants; and enrollment will usea 3:1 male:female ratio.Sampling Strategy: PAK-SEHAT aims to be as representative as possible of the generalPakistani population; and a multi-stage cluster sampling strategy will be used to identifycandidates to participate in the study. A cluster is defined as a Union Council (UC); whichis the smallest administrative division in Pakistan defined by the Government; with anapproximate population of 30;000 people each. The first stage of the sampling process occursat the province level; which is the largest administrative division in the country; andparticipants will be recruited from all four Pakistani provinces and the Federal territory ofIslamabad. Next; districts will be selected; and within those; the UCs. Using the country'smost updated census data; one district from each province will be selected. Stratifiedsampling will be done using rural and urban proportions declared by Pakistan's government.The sampling of the districts will be stratified based on their rural and urban distribution;which should be representative of the province's rural/urban proportion. Within eachdistrict; one urban and one rural UC will be selected based on convenience. Households withinthe UC will be selected by systematic sampling. The sampling interval will be calculatedusing census data on population size and desired sample from each UC. The last stage isparticipant selection from each household. Only one member of each will be allowed toparticipate.Participant Enrollment Community based door-to-door surveying will be the primary method ofparticipant recruitment both in rural and urban areas. However; a critical first step will beto identify the local stakeholders of the selected area/community. The research team willarrange meetings with these leaders to inform them about the study and have their support towork with the local community. Once engaged; those leaders will be asked to help disseminatethe study and contact individual participants for enrollment. Another important resource whenidentifying and enrolling eligible participants are Government front-line health workers;known as Lady Health Workers. These are residents of the area and their primaryresponsibility is to provide preventive healthcare and promote health among women; men; andchildren. They maintain logs of the residents living in their area of action and can serve asa good resource to identify and reach potential participants.After receiving the line-listing of potential candidates for participation; study personnelwill visit those individuals at their households and screen them for eligibility using astructured questionnaire. Individuals who are deemed eligible to participate in the studywill be provided with detailed information about the study; invited to ask questions; andasked to provide written informed consent for participation. If the potential participant isnot literate; then; in the presence of a family member; the consent form will be read to theparticipant; and thumb impression will be taken for consent. The family member will serve aswitness and will provide the signature or the thumb impression (as appropriate) on theconsent form.All the participants will undergo study measurements at mobile health set-up except first 100participants. The first 100 participants will be from urban Sindh and will have theirmeasurements at the study hospital to have a dry run of the study procedures. It will help usto identify the challenges in the study flow and to rectify them before starting the mobileset-up. For rest of the participants; measurements will be taken at the mobile health set-up.After consenting; participants will be inquired about convenient times for them to visit themobile health set-up that will be used for data collection in those areas .Then; the studyteam will visit the participants' households on the agreed time and bring them to the mobileset-up. Participants will be brought in groups of 4-5 at a time to utilize working hours andtransport resources efficiently.Baseline Evaluation Once enrolled; all participants will undergo a comprehensive set ofbaseline evaluations; some of which will be repeated using identical methods during studyfollow-up .Study interview and questionnaires. Participants will be interviewed by trained studypersonnel. Sociodemographic data; and information on past and present medical history; familyhistory; lifestyle will be collected using structured questionnaires.Blood pressure and ankle-brachial index (ABI). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will bemeasured in each participant using a DINAMAP monitor (General Electric); With participantssitting in a comfortable position for 5 minutes. Three readings will be taken and theiraverage will be used in subsequent analyses. Lying blood pressure will also be measured inthe participants' arms and legs and the ankle-brachial index will be calculated.Anthropometry and body composition. Height (cm) will be measured through wall mountedmeasuring tape. Body composition will be analyzed using the Tanita-MC-780 U body compositionanalyzer.Blood measurements and genetics. Trained study personnel will draw approximately 30 mL ofvenous blood from each participant. Approximately 10 mL of blood will be biobanked and storedat -80C to allow for future additional research studies; including genetic testing. Thelatter will include but not limited to testing for ApoE Genotype (information about risk ofheart disease and response to amounts of dietary fat); 9p21 Genotype (risk of MI and CAD atan early age); KIF6 Genotype (risk of heart disease and reduction of MACE with statins); LPAIntron 25 (increased risk of heart disease); 4q25 A-Fib genotype (risk of atrial fibrillationand risk of stroke due to atrial fibrillation). In participants who do not consent forgenetic testing; their 10 mL of biobanked blood may be used in non-genetic analyses but notfor studies involving genetic testing.Cardiac CT scans. Participants will first undergo a non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CT forcoronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring; followed by a contrast-enhanced CCTA. Toshiba AquilionMultislice CT scanners and prospective ECG triggering will be used. Participants will beevaluated before the CT scan by study personnel and if the heart rate is above 65 bpm will bepre-treated with a Î²-blocker (or ivabradine if contraindicated) to achieve a target heartrate of ~60 bpm. Sublingual nitroglycerin will be administered as per standard protocolsapproximately 3 minutes before the CCTA scan; and intravenous contrast will be injected at arate of 5.5-7 ml/s depending on the body habitus of the participant; for an average patient;the dose of contrast is expected to be approximately 60-80 mL. The non-contrast-enhancedimages will be transferred to the Cardiology CT core lab at Tabba Heart Institute andevaluated by trained radiologists who will quantify CAC according to Agatston's method.Carotid ultrasound imaging . All participants will undergo carotid ultrasound imaging forassessment of presence of carotid plaque and for carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT)evaluation. This will be assessed with automated measurement over bilateral carotid arteriesusing a Toshiba Aplio 500 ultrasound system (Otawara; Japan); using B-mode ultrasoundexamination with a 10-MHz multi-frequency linear array transducer. Participants will beexamined in the supine position; and standard measurements will be performed.Baseline testing sequence. At the mobile set-up; first participants will undergo BPmeasurement; ABI; anthropometric measurements; and body composition analysis; Thenparticipant will be prepared for CCTA. Blood specimens will be collected when canulated forCCTA; then CCTA will be performed and then carotid ultrasound.Baseline Data Management and Quality Study data will be collected in tablets and otherdigital platforms and will be transferred periodically to a central server. The centralizedstudy database will be stored at the Tabba Heart Institute using a secure server; and dataprivacy and confidentiality will be secured at all times. For quality control purposes; thedata collection application in the tablets will have in-built features to limit erroneousdata entry and inconsistency in recording of participant's responses. Also; a fieldcoordinator will monitor data collection and spot check 5-10% of the interviews. At thecentralized study database; data error reports will be generated on a monthly basis tomonitor completeness; invalid values; and inconsistencies in responses. In addition; a livedashboard will be developed for pre-identified key variables to monitor and evaluate theproject's progress.Follow-Up and Event Ascertainment As part of the study follow-up; participants will becontacted at 12; 30; and 60 months (5 years) after baseline. Besides repeat blood tests andimaging testing at 30 and 60 months (Table 2); in each of the three follow-up visits aquestionnaire will be used to collect information on ASCVD outcomes. In case of anaffirmative answer; participants will be asked to provide additional evidence (e.g. hospitaladmission records) so that the event can be confirmed. ASCVD events will include myocardialinfarction; unstable angina; stable angina; stroke; transient ischemic attack; coronaryrevascularization; and cardiovascular death.Published definitions will be used to define each of these incident events. An independentTwo cardiologists from the centralized PAK-SEHAT adjudication committee and blinded to theresults of the study tests will classify events as definite; probable; or absent; basedprimarily on available hospital documentation. They will also classify CHD-; CVD- or stroke-related deaths based on hospital records (if available) and verbal autopsy interviews withfamilies. If there is disagreement in event adjudication between the 2 assigned experts; athird independent physician adjudicator will review the evidence to break the tie.The repeat CCTA at 60 months of follow-up will be used to evaluate the progression/regressionof coronary plaque burden.Statistical Analyses For analyses using baseline data; the frequency and distribution ofcardiovascular risk factors (known; unknown); coronary plaque burden; and other key baselinevariables using number and frequency (%) for categorial variables and mean (standarddeviation) or median (interquartile range) for normally and not normally distributedcontinuous variables will be described. Specifically for coronary plaque characteristics; theCAC score will be categorized as 0; >0-<100; â‰¥100; and the distribution of CAC scores andproportion of each stratum will be reported. With regards to CCTA findings; the proportion ofparticipants with any coronary plaque and the distribution of plaque subtypes will bereported with 95% CI. Investigators will also report the frequency of having a maximalcoronary stenosis â‰¥50% and â‰¥70%; respectively; and the proportion of participants withhigh-risk plaque features. The distributions of number of coronary vessels with plaque;number of coronary segments affected per participant; and the location of coronary plaques(left main; anterior descending; circumflex; and right coronary artery) will also bedescribed.In analyses of incident events during follow-up; investigators will use standard survivalanalysis and time-to-event techniques. Cumulative incidence at 5 years (in %) and incidencerates per 1;000 person-years (with 95% CI) will be computed for the primary and secondarystudy outcomes. The ASCVD event rates in the PAK-SEHAT population will be compared with thoseof Pakistanis of the same age and sex free of clinical ASCVD and not included in the study.Analyses of incidence of cardiovascular risk factors during follow-up will be restricted toindividuals at-risk of each of those risk factors.Investigators will use Cox Proportional Hazards regression models to evaluate the associationbetween important baseline characteristics and incident ASCVD events during follow-up.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2021-11-30,2021-12-14,2021-12-13,Observational,NA,NA,Atherosclerosis|Coronary Artery Disease|Myocardial Ischemia|Diabetes Mellitus; Type 2|Plaque; Atherosclerotic,ATHEROSCLEROSIS|CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE|SOUTH ASIAN|YOUNG|PAKISTAN|EPIDEMIOLOGY,Burden and progression of atherosclerotic plaque assessed via coronary computed tomography angiography; Burden and progession of atherosclerotic plaque will by measured by coronary computed tomographical angiography (CCTA).

Unfortunately; this remains elusive because no single clinical measure or testcan reflect complex pathophysiological changes in patients with sepsis. However; multipleclinical and laboratory parameters indicate impending sepsis and organ dysfunction. Screeningtools using these parameters can help identify the condition; such as SIRS; quick SOFA(qSOFA); National Early Warning Score (NEWS); or Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS). The2016 SCCM/ESICM task force recommended using qSOFA; while the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaignstrongly recommended against its use compared with SIRS; NEWS; or MEWS as a single screeningtool for sepsis or septic shock. We hypothesised that qSOFA has greater prognostic accuracythan SIRS and EWS (NEWS/NEWS2/MEWS).; Over the past decade; medical advances in sepsis continued to focus on sepsis as a prevalentcondition that accounts for 10% of admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) and isassociated with a 10-20% in-hospital mortality rate. Standardised protocols and physicianawareness have significantly improved survival; but mortality rates remain between 20% and36%; with ~270;000 deaths annually in the United States. However; of patients with sepsis;80% are treated in an emergency department (ED); and the remainder develops sepsis duringhospitalisation with other conditions. In 2016; the Society of Critical CareMedicine/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (SCCM/ESICM) task force redefined sepsisbased on organ dysfunction and mortality prediction. Sepsis now is defined aslife-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Thisdefinition emphasises the complexity of the disease that cannot be explained by infection orbody response to it. Acute change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score â‰¥2indicates sepsis-related organ dysfunction; a predictor of excess in-hospital mortality.Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis terms were omitted fromthe most recent definition. SIRS has been criticised for its poor specificity; while severesepsis may underestimate sepsis's seriousness. A subset of patients may develop septic shockwith underlying profound organ dysfunction and excess mortality. Clinically; septic shock isdefined as persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure(MAP) â‰¥ 65 mm Hg and serum lactate level â‰¥ 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) despite adequate volumeresuscitation. Early identification of a patient with infection who may develop sepsis is ofutmost importance.

For the post-operative model; the investigators will also include patient information available up to 12 hours after surgery.<br><br>SUMMARY:The PARADISE study aims to develop and validate prediction tools to identify patients at riskof Atrial Fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery.; Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common abnormal heart rhythm. AF causes the heart to beatirregularly and sometimes very rapidly. About 30-50% of patients develop AF after heartsurgery. These patients stay longer on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after surgery; are morelikely to develop complications and have a higher risk of dying. Avoiding AF is important.Some drugs; including beta blockers and amiodarone may help prevent AF if given aftersurgery. However; these may also lead to complications (such as lung damage). It is thereforeimportant to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from these treatments (i.e.;where the benefits outweigh the risks). There are existing tools designed to predict the riskof suffering AF after heart surgery. However; they are unreliable and therefore not used inclinical practice. A modern; reliable risk prediction tool is needed.The PARADISE study will develop and test new prediction tools to identify which patients aremost at risk of developing AF after heart surgery. The investigators will focus our tools onthose patients who most commonly develop AF; such as those who have had surgery to repair avalve or blood vessel in their heart.To do this the investigators will:-Review the medical literature and assemble a panel of medical experts to create a listof known factors that affect patients' risk of AF after heart surgery-Use a large UK general practice database (CALIBER) to see whether the investigators canfind new risk factors.-Ask the expert panel to agree a list of known and new risks factors to be included inthe prediction tool.-Develop two new prediction tools using an existing American cardiac surgery database(the Partners research Database). The first will be used before surgery; the secondimmediately following surgery. Two models are needed as events during surgery may alterthe risk of AF.-Test how reliably our new tools predict which patients suffer AF after surgery; withdata from large UK NHS heart centres; one US Hospital (Brigham) and a UK clinical trial(Tight-K).-The investigators will work with two charities (AF Alliance and StopAfib) to share ourresults with patients and the wider public.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Active; not recruiting,NA,2022-02-07,2022-02-24,2022-02-21,Observational,NA,NA,Atrial Fibrillation,New Onset Atrial Fibrillation|Cardiac Surgery,Model discrimination (c-statistic) to predict Atrial Fibrillation in external data set.

Progression-free Survival. Tumor Response. To Determine and Compare the Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE Version 3.0 for the Regimens Administered on This Study.; The observed length of life from randomization into the study to death or the date of last contact. Disease that can be assessed clinically (physical examination) should be evaluated every cycle (every 3 weeks). Disease assessed by imaging modalities (CXR; CT; MRI) should be evaluated every other cycle unless other evidence of a change mandates earlier assessment. Tumor measurements should also be done after the final cycle (if the patient is taken off of study therapy for a reason other than progression) and then every 3 months x 2 years (followed with every 6 months x 3 years) until progression is documented. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0); as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions assessed radiographically and 50% increase if the only target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam; or unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion; or the appearance of new lesions; or similar definition as accurate and appropriate.

NCT01353131,Personalized Risk Identification and Management for Arrhythmias and Heart Failure by 12 Lead Electrocardiogram and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging.; Personalized Risk Identification and Management for Arrhythmias and Heart Failure by ECG and MRI,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Prevention of myocardial functional deterioration and sudden cardiac death among individualsof intermediate risk remains one of the most elusive frontiers of contemporary medicine.While most of these individuals are known to have had contact with the medical system; theyare frequently not considered to be at high risk until far advanced along one or multipledisease processes leading to irreversible myocardial loss and electric instability. The goalof this proposal is to determine the prognostic power of combining specific measures ofventricular architecture; myocardial structure and electrical function for the earlyidentification of individuals at risk to develop ventricular arrhythmias and progressivemyocardial failure leading to severe cardiovascular outcomes and death.; During C-TRIP Stage 1 we refined a risk stratification algorithm based on the electronicanalysis of 69;088 routine 12-lead ECGs performed in a large medical institution during a 6month period by combining previously established indices of abnormal repolarization (wideQRS-T angle) with validated measures of myocardial damage (Selvester QRS score). Amongpatients considered at risk; 4.9% had perished 18 months later and among the survivors those> 70 years of age or with LV ejection fraction â‰¤ 35%; or at a high risk of dying within 3years from cancer; end stage cardiac; pulmonary; renal; immunologic or neurologic diseases;were excluded using a simple and reproducible screening arborescence based on the digitalmedical record. From the pool of remaining at risk patients derived from the application ofthe same screening methods in three other similarly large academic institutions; a sample of1100 individuals will be recruited for further risk stratification as participants of theC-TRIP Stage 2 prospective study. For C-TRIP Stage 2; patients will undergo detailedphenotypic studies including contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI; ECG Holter recordings at rest andduring a 6 minute walk; signal averaged ECG and biomarkers of inflammation; myocardialischemia and stress; as well as indices of collagen synthesis and turnover. Patients will befollowed for 3 years for the development of a combined clinical outcome including mortality(all cause; cardiac and sudden cardiac death) and hospitalization for non-fatal myocardialinfarction; acute coronary syndromes; ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure. From thecombination of selected phenotypic markers of poor outcome; a risk score will be developedand used for the design of prophylactic strategies aimed at curbing premature sudden cardiacdeath and end-stage cardiac disease among patients currently classified as havingintermediate levels of risk.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2011-05-11,2011-05-12,2018-11-02,Observational,NA,NA,Heart Failure,electrocardiogram|cardiac magnetic resonance|heart failure|sudden cardiac death|ECG scoring|Delayed enhancement,; ,; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,12,5,2011,blah,1234,1234,1234
NCT01936571,Use of Blood Biomarkers to Predict Overall Survival for Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients Treated With (Chemo)Radiotherapy.; Usefulness of Blood Biomarkers for Overall Survival in NSCLC,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Correlation of blood biomarkers to overall survival; <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Lung cancer is the most common cancer type worldwide; with more than 1.1 million annualdeaths. There are two types of the disease; namely non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) andsmall-cell lung cancer (SCLC); with the first accounting for 85% of the total number ofcases. The 5-year survival across stages remains disappointingly low; around 10% in mostcountries; due to a high incidence of both loco-regional and distant failure [3]. However;during the last decade improved radiotherapy techniques allowed an increase of the radiationdose; while at the same time more effective chemo radiation schemes are being applied. Thesedevelopments have lead to improved outcome in terms of survival. As the TNM staging system ishighly inaccurate for the prediction of survival outcome for non-surgical patients; attemptshave been made to develop a more accurate risk stratification for these patients [1;2]. Amodel based on clinical variables yielded an AUC of 0.74; which was encouraging; but alsoleft room for improvement [2]. An extended model; which included clinical as well asbiomarker variables; reached a higher AUC; but the limited number of patients included inthis study made it impossible to draw definitive conclusions [1].New prognostic parameters can be retrieved from several sources; which include anatomic;molecular and functional imaging; genomics; proteomics and clinical analysis of patients. Theunlimited amount of information is expected to lead to more accurate predictions ofindividual treatment outcome [4].The analysis of biomarkers; including proteins; is a fast developing; promising andchallenging area of research. Biomarkers can measure or evaluate normal biological processes;pathogenic processes; or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention.Oncoproteins are produced by; or in response to tumor cells; and may be secreted in thecirculation of patients. As tissue sampling is often not possible in lung cancer patients;blood sample collection by venepuncture offers an attractive alternative; which is safe andeasy to implement. A number of studies described the prognostic and predictive value of bloodbiomarkers for NSCLC [5-7]. In this study we will investigate the prognostic value of bloodbiomarkers related to 1) hypoxia: Osteopontin (OPN); carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-9); andlactate dehydrogenase (LDH); 2) inflammation - interleukin 6 (IL-6); IL-8; and C-reactiveprotein (CRP); and Î±-2-macroglobulin (Î±-2M); and 3) tumor load: Carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA) and cytokeratin fragment (CYFRA 21-1).1.

The value of radiomics is evaluated in this perspective.; Sensitivity is low for prediction of long term survival of currently available prognosticscores for brain metastases. First the current clinical models will be optimized with a newprognostic model and nomogram. Radiomics is a tool to analyze tumor characteristics based onCT and MR images. These tumor characteristics may reflect tumor biology and outcome.Therefore it is investigated if radiomics improves prediction of long term survival afterstereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases.

In this study the investigators doacute CT angiography; a non-invasive imaging method to explore etiology and prognostic riskfactors of ICH. Further the investigators will aim to develop and validate a risk score forpredicting 1-year functional outcome after ICH.; Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 10 %-15 % of all strokes and is one of leadingcauses of stroke related mortality and morbidity worldwide. Despite advances in medicalknowledge; treatment for ICH remains strictly supportive. ICH accounted for 26.7ï½ž51.5% ofstroke in China; the proportion was higher than in Western countries. There were lack of dataand analysis about medical management; etiology; and long-term outcome of ICH in Beijing.In this study we do acute CT angiography (CTA); a non-invasive imaging method to exploreetiology and prognostic risk factors of ICH. Further we will aim to develop and validate arisk score for predicting 1-year functional outcome after ICH. There are some studies of CTAto assess the cause of ICH and functional outcomes; but lack of multi-center; large samplestudies to support and validate these findings; particularly fewer application ofpostcontrast CT. This would allow an early intervention base on different causes and Selecttreatment decisions according to risk score.We are planning to:When patients with ICH arrive in stroke department of the topic cooperation hospitals within72 hours after symptom onset; they will be subject to CTA with the protocoled sequences.Standard sequences: Pre- and postcontrast head imaging is acquired from the skull base tovertex with parameters: 120 kVp; 340 mA; 4x5 mm collimation; 1second/rotation; and a tablespeed of 15 mm/rotation. CTA was performed immediately after initial noncontrast CT(NCCT)performance using a bolus-tracking method by injecting 90 mL of nonionic iodinated contrast(OPTIRAY 350) at 5 mL/s. The protocol for the circle of Willis was 120 kVp; 360 mAs; 0.5second/rotation; 0.75 mm thick with a pitch of 0.65. Postprocessing procedure includingmultiplanar reconstruction was performed by a CT technologist at the CT operator's discretionfor assessment of contrast extravagation and etiologies of ICH such as vascular malformation;and venous sinus thrombosis. Coronal and sagittal multiplanar reconstructed images werecreated as 10.0-mm-thick images spaced by 3 mm. Axial reformed images were 4 mm thick with2-mm spacing.Clinical data of patients with ICH will be collected by 2 neurologists blinded to theradiological data during patients' hospitalization and at the 3-month; 6-month; and 1-yearfollow-up. The collected demographic and clinical variables included gender; age; body massindex; alcohol and tobacco use; history of hypertension; diabetes; hyperlipidemia; stroke;coronary heart disease; and medications (antihypertensive; antiplatelet; and anticoagulationagents). The systolic and diastolic blood pressure of patients will be recorded. Strokeseverity on admission will be evaluated by Glasgow Coma Scale and National Institutes ofHealth Stroke Scale. Laboratory tests on admission included white blood cell count;hemoglobin; platelet count; serum glucose; serum creatinine; fibrinogen; activated partialthromboplastin time; and prothrombin time as expressed by the international normalized ratio.Length of hospital stay was recorded. The patients' clinical outcome will be assessed bymodified Rankin Scale on discharge and 30-day; 3-month; 6-month; and 1-year.To sum up the purpose of this present study is to explore etiology and prognostic riskfactors of ICH by acute CTA and develop and validate a risk score for predicting 1-yearfunctional outcome after ICH.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Unknown status,Not yet recruiting,2015-01-07,2015-01-29,2015-01-26,Observational,NA,NA,Cerebral Hemorrhage|Hemorrhage,Etiology|Prognostic risk factors|Intracerebral Hemorrhage|non-invasive imaging|CT angiography,one-year functional outcome and mortality of Intracerebral hemorrhage.; Good functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) â‰¤2.,; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,29,1,2015,blah,1234,1234,1234

A total of 122 recession defects without CAL and with an amount of CAL equal orsmaller to the buccal CAL ; located at upper and lower incisors and canines were treated withCAF+CTG. IPH; AERSA and CAL parameters were analyzed for possible correlation with CRC after6 months.; The coronally advanced flap (CAF) with connective tissue graft (CTG) has been confirmed asthe gold standard for treatment of gingival recessions ). CTG-based procedures provide thebest outcomes with superior percentages of mean root coverage (MRC) and complete rootcoverage (CRC) and keratinized tissue (KT) gain. Data in previous reports show CRC range from18% to 83% after CAF+CTG in Miller Classes I and II defects which are associated with nointer-dental clinical attachment loss (interdental-CAL) (Recession Type 1-RT1)The use of CTG under CAF significantly enhances the probability to achieve CRC (%57) inrecessions in which interdental-CAL is equal or smaller than the buccal attachment loss(Recession Type 2-RT2). It has been emphasized that CRC percentage was very similar to theresult (60%) of a multicentre study on the treatment of RT1 recessions (Cortellini et al.2009). Moreover; CRC was higher than most of the reports on treatment of RT1 or Miller I andII defects (more than 80%) when baseline interdental-CAL was between 1 and 3 mm Therefore;various CRC outcomes of the literature indicate that there is need for additional defectdefining criteria for predicting the outcomes of root coverage (RC) in RT 1 and RT2(interdental-CALâ‰¤ 3mm) recession defects.Predetermination of final RC which is important for distinguishing 'expected versus actual'amount of RC was found to be related to inter-dental papilla height (IPH) and inter-dentalclinical attachment level (ICAL) by the clinical studies which reported correlation betweenthese two anatomical characteristics and CRC. Recently a new predictive classification ofgingival recessions using the baseline avascular exposed root surface area (AERSA) as anidentification criterion has been proposed. AERSA resulted as a strong predictor of final RCafter laterally positioned flap (LPF) leading to a prognostic model with AERSA explaining 86%of the mean root coverage. In addition; due to anatomic variations; some Miller Class Idefects may have larger AERSA than Miller Class II and III defects or there may be smallerMiller Class III defects than Miller Class I and II defects which may significantly influencethe treatment results. These results could help to explain the outcome variations amongprevious studies.The prognostic anticipation of a certain amount of RC is a complex process includingpatient-related; tooth/site-related (GRD; root abrasion; ICAL; tooth type; the dimension ofinter-dental papilla; AERSA) and technique-related (e.g. quality of the CTG) factors andoperator's skill. It is essential to define the most potent prognostic factors' combinationwhich can increase the success and predictability rates; to make CAF+CTG the most convenientRC technique for patients and clinicians. Therefore the aim of this study was to explore thepredictive values of baseline IPH; AERSA and ICAL measurements on the final RC outcomes afterCAF+CTG in RT1 and RT2 class GR defects.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Completed,NA,2015-06-17,2015-06-24,2015-06-19,Interventional,Non-Randomized,Diagnostic,Gingival Recession,prognostic factors,values of baseline interdental papill height; in mm,avascular exposed root surface area interdental clinical attachment level; .n mm2 in mm,1234,1234,1234,1234,24,6,2015,blah,1234,1234,1234

After complete resectionand postoperative chemotherapy (POCT); 20%-40% of cases have a risk of locoregionalrecurrence (LRR). Postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) should be an integral component ofthe multidisciplinary treatment for patients with stage IIIA(N2) disease. PostoperativeRadiotherapy (PORT)-first strategy may have an advantage of the early administration oflocoregional therapy to the mediastinum; in which the tumor burden is presumed to be higherthan that of systematic micrometastases. It is not yet known for subsets with specificprognostic factors that confer higher LRR risks; what is the optimal timing of PORT and howto integrate with POCT (in a sequential fashion or concurrent fashion) when PORT isconsidered for patients with completely resected stage IIIA(N2) NSCLC.Purpose: This randomized phase III trial is studying the optimal timing of PORT to evaluatewhether the PORT-first strategy (PORT administered first with concurrent or subsequent POCT)may be more effective than the PORT-last strategy (PORT administered sequentially followingPOCT) in treating high risk of LRR patients with completely resected pathologic stageIIIA(N2) NSCLC.; <br><br>OBJECTIVES:1. Primary- Investigate the optimal timing of PORT for completely resected pathologic stageIIIa(N2) NSCLC by comparing the disease-free survival of patients with high risk of LRRtreated with PORT-first vs PORT-last strategy.2.

The clinical risk prediction model for LRRhas been established based on our large institutional database. On multivariate analysis;heavy cigarette smoking history; cN2 status; and number of involved lymph nodes>4 wereindependently significant factors predicting high risk of LRR.

The study objective is to improve thesafety of extubation by harnessing hidden information contained in the patterns of variationof heart and respiratory rate measured over intervals-in-time.; As a standard of care for patients who are intubated in the ICU; to assess ability to beextubated; a Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) is performed; where the level of ventilatorsupport is reduced; and patient's response is observed to predict if they will tolerateextubation.Spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) are standard of care in assessing extubation readiness;however; there are no universally accepted guidelines regarding their precise performance andreporting.Given that health is associated with a high degree of variation of physiologic parameters(e.g. heart and respiratory rate); and illness & stress are associated with a loss ofvariability; the investigators have demonstrated that maintaining a high level of heart rate(HRV) and respiratory rate variability (RRV) prior to and throughout the SpontaneousBreathing Trial (SBT) will predict successful extubation; and a reduction in heart rate (HRV)and respiratory rate variability (RRV) predicts extubation failure.Research to date has already demonstrated the added prognostic value and the investigatorshave derived a predictive model based on continuous monitoring of respiratory ratevariability (RRV). The investigators are now poised to evaluate Extubation Advisor (EA)software with the overall goal to transform monitoring and improve care.This study is a mixed methods; pilot phase I observational study of the clinicalimplementation of a novel clinical decision support product; Extubation Advisor.TM In thisstudy the investigators will evaluate the feedback of RTs as well as the feedback of MDspost-treatment (extubation) decision.Questionnaires will be sent to Respiratory Therapists (RT's) and Medical Doctors (MD's) tosolicit feedback on the electronic Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) Case Report Form (CRF)and the Extubation Advisor TM (EA) report.

NCT03024463,The Multi-center Validation Study of Breast Cancer Internal Mammary Lymph Biopsy; The Multi-center Validation Study of Internal Mammary Lymph Biopsy With Modified Injection Technique in Breast Cancer Patients,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:The accuracy (false negative rate) of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy; <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:The number of internal mammary non-sentinel lymph node metastases in patients with positive axillary node and internal mammary sentinel lymph node Factors influencing the number of internal mammary non-sentinel lymph node metastases in patients with positive axillary node and internal mammary sentinel lymph node; <br><br>SUMMARY:In addition to axillary lymph node (ALN); internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) chain is alsothe first-echelon nodal drainage site for metastasis and it provides important prognosticinformation in breast cancer patients. However; decision about local treatment of IMLN isstill being made based on ALN status. The 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer NetworkGuidelines recommend internal mammary lymph node irradiation for patients with more than 4positive ALNs (category 1); and strongly consider irradiation for patients with 1 to 3positive ALNs (category 2A). Therefore; there will be patients in positive ALN subgroup whojust face complications of an unnecessary radiation to IMLN and there will be patients innegative ALN subgroup who do not receive adjuvant radiation therapy they really need. Thus;these inclusion criteria of National Comprehensive Cancer Network might lead toover-treatment and under-treatment. Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB)provides a less invasive method of assessing the IMLN than surgical dissection. However; lowvisualization rate of IM-SLN has been a restriction of IM-SLNB. A modified radiotracerinjection technique was established in our previous study. This technique could significantlyimprove the IM-SLN detection rate. The investigators have validated the accurate of thehypothesis and the modified radiotracer injection technique in the previous study.For axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy; the success rate and the accuracy are the mostimportant technical indicators. The relatively lower false-negative rate is a preconditionfor the widely application of SLNB. Axillary SLNB needs to be accomplished with thecooperation of multi-disciplinary teamwork; including the breast surgery; the radiologist;the nuclear medicine doctor and the pathologist; in order to obtain a better success rate anda lower false-negative rate. Our previous studies confirmed that the modified radiotracerinjection technique can greatly improve the IM-SLN detection rate. However; whether theIM-SLNB based on the modified radiotracer injection technique has a low false negative rateor not still need to be confirmed by a further validation research.Furthermoreï¼Œrecently; the investigators propose that if IM-SLN is the only metastatic lymphnode and there would be no positive node else in IMLN chain; the radiotherapy and itsassociated complications could be avoided in these patients. On the other hand; if there isthe presence of metastatic non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) in IMLN chain after IM-SLNB; it isimportant to predict the risk of IM-NSLN metastasis in IM-SLN positive patients. As there iscurrently no such model; a predictive model for IM-SLN positive patients to avoidradiotherapy is needed in this situation. Therefore; a new study will be conducted to verifythe issues above.In the current study; all the participants (18~70 years of age) would have the preoperativepathology of invasive breast cancer and positive fine-needle aspiration result in theirclinical or ultrasonic suspicious axillary lymph node. 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid wasinjected into the parenchyma under the ultrasound guidance 3 to 18 hours before surgery. Twosyringes of 9.25 to 18.5MBq 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid in 0.5 to 0.7mL volume were injectedat the 6 and 12 o'clock positions 0.5 to 1.0 cm from areola (about 2.0~4.0 cm from thenipple). IM-SLNB was performed in all participants with IMSLN visualized on preoperativelymphoscintigraphy and/or detected by the intra-operative gamma probe. All hotspots in theinternal mammary basin were harvested and intra-operative identification of the IM-SLN wasbased on gamma probe detection. The IM-SLN was sectioned along the long axis into two blocksand all blocks were tested by the frozen section and the touch imprint cytologyintra-operatively. Those participants with positive intra-operative results received IMLNdissection. Finally; all the IM-SLN blocks and IM-NSLN dissected were assessedpost-operatively by H&E and Cytokeratin 19 stained immunohistochemistry.

The optimal VTAprediction model will be constructed using logistic regression and bootstrap models. Patientswho experience primary end point should undergo secondary SCD prevention using implantablecardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35%; 40 days post acute myocardial infarction (AMI); will be candidates for primary SCDprevention.; Study design Predict-VT is an investigator-initiated; prospective; open-label; single-centerclinical trial. The research protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of theClinical Center of Serbia. All participants will have to provide their informed consent inwriting. The trial design will ensure that all participants abide by good clinical practiceand the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki II.Study population The study will include 600 patients with acute myocardial infarction with STelevation (STEMI) who are eligible for treatment with primary percutaneous coronaryintervention (PPCI) within 12 hours from the onset of symptoms. Enrollment started on January2017 . Recruitment will continue until 600 patients have been randomized. The end of therecruitment period is planned for January 2020. The trial will continue until all availablesurvivors have been followed for at least 4 years.Objectives; end points and definitions The primary objective of PREDICT-VT trial is to testthe hypothesis that the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA) and sudden cardiacdeath (SCD) is predictable with acceptable accuracy among STEMI patients undergoing PPCI.Therefore; the PREDICT-VT specified primary end point is the analysis of independentpredictors of VTA and SCD in a period of 3-40 days following STEMI.

Descriptive measures.<br><br>SUMMARY:Acute pancreatitis (AP) is inflammation of the pancreas usually triggered by gallstones ordrinking excessive alcohol. 80% of people who have an episode of AP will recover withoutcomplications. However; 20% will require treatment in high dependency or intensive care formultiple organ dysfunction (AP-MODS). It is known that this negatively affects recovery andcan have a lasting effect on health although it is incompletely understood what causes this.Aim: To recruit 500 patients with acute pancreatitis. Participants will be assessed atrecruitment and and again at 3 and 36 months. Recovery of organ function will be seriallymeasured and the presence of novel factors important in recovery assessed.; Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common and devastating disease with an annual incidence of 22-30per 100;000 in the UK. The incidence is increasing. AP is most commonly triggered bygallstones or alcohol excess and has a range of outcomes; from complete resolution to death;with an overall mortality in Scotland of 5.2%. AP is characterised by acute inflammation ofthe pancreas; which initiates a cascade of inflammatory events throughout the body that canlead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in approximately 25% of AP patients.Mortality in AP is greatest in those patients who develop MODS; with death rates reported tobe up to 28%.The development of persistent organ failure characterises severe AP (SAP) as defined in therevised Atlanta classification; and is strongly predictive of a fatal outcome. A significantproportion of research has focussed on reducing mortality and morbidity in the first week. Asa consequence; it remains to be seen whether the patterns of early organ dysfunction arereflected in the causes of long-term mortality and morbidity.Recently published data from a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the RoyalInfirmary of Edinburgh with acute pancreatitis has shown that the early development of MODSis associated with an increased mortality rate up to 10 years after the index presentation.This strongly suggests that MODS in acute pancreatitis (AP-MODS) has a persistent anddeleterious impact on patients' physiological status; though the exact nature of thispathology remains to be characterised. Recent data has indicated that the severity of thefirst attack of AP significantly influences the risk of progression to chronic pancreatitis;and therefore subsequent long-term morbidity.This observational clinical cohort study aims to characterise the nature and extent of thepathophysiological impact of SAP on organ function over the first 3 years following the indexevent and the long-term deleterious effect of SAP. This will be achieved by prospectivelyevaluating the pathophysiological consequences of an episode of AP by measuring organ systemfunction in patients recruited during a hospital admission with AP. We will obtain anin-depth assessment of patients' health at presentation; and at 3 months and 36 months afterthe first episode of AP using markers of organ function and/or disease in the peripheralblood. In a nested cohort within the main study cohort; we will conduct cardiorespiratoryevaluation tests (including exercise testing); specialised blood tests of the immune system;tests for precision medicine; and imaging to assess structure and function of key organsystems.The results of this study will inform the design of future interventions designed to improvethe long-term prognosis of patients.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Active; not recruiting,NA,2017-09-29,2017-11-17,2021-12-07,Observational,NA,NA,Pancreatitis,Pancreatitis|Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome,Annual incidence of new-onset type 3c diabetes mellitis in patients with AP.

The main purposes of thismulticenter registry are to: 1) determine CMR findings; and specifically late gadoliniumenhancement (LGE) features; T1 mapping; and extracellular volume (ECV) that predict suddencardiac death (SCD) and ventricular arrhythmia; 2) provide a comprehensive clinical andimaging score that effectively improves the selection of patients who deserve a prophylacticICD therapy; 3) evaluate the contribution of machine learning to predict major adversecardiac events (MACE) as compared to standard clinical scores.; The current guidelines provide indications for primary prevention implanted cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) therapy based on left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) and New YorkHeart Association (NYHA) class. This strategy is able to intercept only part of fatalarrhythmic events and; on the other hand; led to useless ICD implantations mainly among thosepatients with severe heart failure (HF) who will never incur in sever arrhythmias but ratherwill die because of decompensated HF. Cardiac magnetic resonance offers the possibility ofidentifying and quantitatively assessing myocardium fibrosis both localized in a specificarea and diffuse and has already proved a significant prognostic meaning. DERIVATE is aprospective; international; multicenter; observational registry of stable HF patients withreduced LVEF who underwent clinical evaluation; transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) andcardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Specifically; the primary aim of DERIVATE is to determineCMR findings that predict outcomes; with incremental value over LVEF and NYHA classification.The DERIVATE registry uses a collaborative design with contribution and merger of similarprospectively enrolled cohorts from 33 sites in 6 countries in Europe and North America. Thetargeted population for the DERIVATE registry is a large sample of patients with clinicalhistory of chronic HF who have undergone CMR by referral physician. Indication for CMR examswas recorded and classified according to the known causes of HF. All DERIVATE study patientsare followed for all-cause mortality; sudden cardiac death (SCD); cardiovascular death(including death caused by acute myocardial infarction and stroke); sustained ventriculartachycardia (VT); aborted SCD; hospitalization or cardiac death related to chronic HF.

The NORDSTEN-DS (Degenerative spondylolisthesis) (NCT02051374);a randomized controlled trial comparing the outcome of surgery with decompression withoutfixation and decompression with fixation in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis andconcurrent degenerative spondylolisthesis.; Objectives:1. A longitudinal observation of clinical- and radiological development with 5- and 10years follow-up. Variables predicting clinical deterioration or improvement; and outcomemeasurements including time from inclusion to time for surgery; will be analyzed. Wewill use predictive models appropriate to the type of data each prognostic outcomemeasure represents. For example the repeated pain and disability measures will beanalysed using linear mixed models. Logistic regression models with no more than 1variable per 10 events will be used to analyse associations between prognostic factorsand disability. Multivariate analysis will identify the predictive prognostic factors inthe demographic; physical; social and radiological domains. The number of factors thatwill be entered in the multivariate analysis will be condensed by univariate pre-testingand omitting highly correlated factors. The prognostic value of both single and combinedvariables will be addressed by calculating sensitivity; specificity; positive andnegative likelihood ratios in a standard way.Time to surgery will be modeled using Kaplan-Meier plot. Depending on number of treatedpatients the effect of selected covariates on time to surgery will be evaluated usingthe Cox model.2. 1) To investigate differences between patients in the observational cohort and patientstreated surgically in NORDSTEN-SST and NORDSTEN-DS; by comparing baseline demographic-;clinical-; and radiological data. Patients in the NORDSTEN-OS with lumbar spinalstenosis and a verified degenerative spondylolisthesis of â‰¥ 3mm will be compared topatients in the NORDSTEN-DS. Patients in the NORDSTEN-OS with lumbar spinal stenosiswithout degenerative spondylolisthesis will be compared to patients in the NORDSTEN-SST.We will use descriptive statistics to compare the patient groups. For each of thevariables we will compare measures of central tendency such as mean and median; andmeasures of variability such as variance and quantiles. We will also plot distributionsof certain variables using histograms or fitted densities; in order to easier compareand see similarities and differences between the groups.Baseline data Demographical data: Age; gender; BMI; education and native language.

Scale 1 to 6 (1 Good overall performance; 2 Mild overall disability; 3 Moderate overall disability; 4 Severe overall disability; 5 Coma or vegetative state; 6 Brain death/death).<br><br>SUMMARY:Each year around 2000 children have a cardiac arrest in the United Kingdom (UK) andapproximately one fifth are admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Many of these childreneventually die and among those who survive; some will be left with brain damage which couldaffect their quality of life. Currently; it is difficult for doctors to predict how muchbrain damage there is at an early stage after cardiac arrest and if this will improve intime.NEURO-PACK aims to follow up children 3 months after their cardiac arrest to assess theirquality of life and current functional status (has the child returned to usual routine asbefore cardiac arrest/mild disability; can the child not participate in certain activities asthey were before the cardiac arrest/moderate disability; or if the child has near to nomobility/severe disability). Investigators will find this out by using a questionnaire andthe research team will telephone patients and their families 3 months after the child'scardiac arrest. This telephone call should take no longer than 30 minutes. This will then beanalysed and will help towards constructing a tool which will help doctors to predict whichchildren who have had a cardiac arrest may survive with minimal brain damage.; Patients will be recruited from participating PICU's. There is currently lack of accuratedata to enable clinicians to predict which of these children die or survive with braininjury. This affects clear communication with families as well as decisions to apply criticalcare interventions by clinicians. There is also an important knowledge gap with regards tooutcome of children who are admitted to pediatric intensive care after a cardiac arrest andthen survive to discharge.Inclusion Criteria:1. Patients aged 24 hours up to 16th birthday2. Requiring > 1minute cardiopulmonary resuscitation3. Admitted to PICU after Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest or In Hospital Cardiac Arrest4.

Sepsisis a complex process that ultimately leads to circulation disorders; organ perfusionabnormalities; capillary leakage; tissue hypoxia; and organ failure. The difficulty ofclinical treatment is microcirculation and mitochondrial dysfunction in septic shock. Onceshock enters the stage of microcirculation failure; conventional treatment is ineffective.ECMO can effectively support the circulatory system and provide good oxygen delivery; butthere are many controversies in clinical treatment. 1) whether ECMO can effectively improvethe clinical prognosis of children with septic shock; 2) appropriate timing for ECMOintervention; 3) which key clinical factors affect the effect of ECMO treatment. This studyintends to adopt a multi-center; prospective; non-randomized controlled trial design; and themain research hypothesis is whether ECMO treatment can improve the success of dischargesurvival of children with septic shock.; In this study; a variety of statistical analysis methods will be used to screen the clinicalindicators and truncation values suitable for starting ECMO; and to construct a comprehensiveprediction model; so as to determine the basis for the optimal timing of ECMO treatment inthe future. The efficacy of ScVO2; lactic acid; and vasoactive inotrope score (VIS) on theECMO treatment timing will also be evaluated.

Thishas been translated into major UK health policy change through inclusion in the 2017/18 GPcontract; which supports frailty stratification using the eFI; and UK National Health ServiceLong Term Plan.AimTo develop and evaluate the eFI+; a prognostic tool supplementing the original eFI including4 integrated prognostic-decision models. The eFI+ will stratify older people with moderate orsevere frailty into subgroups most likely to benefit from key interventions (communityrehabilitation; falls prevention; comprehensive geriatric assessment; advance care planning).MethodsDesignPrognostic model development; internal validation and external validation using largedatasets (ResearchOne; SAIL databank; Leeds Data Model) and cohort study data (CARE75+); withlinked DAM and health economic analysis.PopulationPatients â‰¥65 with moderate or severe frailty; defined by the existing eFI.Key outcomes12-month outcomes for prognostic models:-New/increased home care package-Emergency Department (ED) attendance/hospitalisation with fall/fracture-Nursing home admission-All-cause mortalityStatistical methodsi) Prognostic modellingThe investigators will build 4 separate prognostic models for our 4 key outcomes by combiningthe eFI with additional individual-level routine data; informed by reviews to identifyprognostic factors. Each model will be developed and internally validated in one largedataset; to adjust for potential overfitting; with subsequent external validation ofpredictive performance in a second large dataset.Separately; the investigators will use CARE75+ (nâ‰ˆ1;200) to investigate additional predictivevalue of clinical measures practical for primary care (e.g. gait speed; activities of dailyliving; loneliness).ii) Decision analytic model (DAM)The investigators will translate the prognostic models into a framework to support clinicaldecision-making; in co-production with stakeholders/PPI. The investigators will integrateprognostic models with effect size estimates from systematic reviews/meta-analyses toidentify relevant thresholds of predicted risk; above which implementation of our keyinterventions would be warranted.iii) Health economic evaluation12-month and long-term cost effectiveness models will be developed; informed by the DAM.; Health technologies being assessedThe eFI+ will be developed using components of the original eFI; supplemented with additionalroutine primary care EHR data; and guidance on the added benefits of implementing simpleclinical measures in routine primary care practice. The eFI+ will be suitable for rapidimplementation in UK primary care EHR systems; building on existing close links with systemsuppliers (SystmOne/EMISWeb/Vision/Microtest).The investigators will develop; then internally and externally validate the eFI+ using theSecure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank; the ResearchOne database; and theLeeds Data Model (LDM).In addition; the investigators will analyse Community Ageing Research 75+ (CARE75+) cohortstudy data (CI Clegg; nâ‰ˆ1;200) as the only national cohort study to include eFI scores; toinvestigate how simple measures that can be assessed in primary care; but are not availablein routine EHR data (e.g. gait speed; timed-up-and-go test; activities of daily living;loneliness) may improve prediction.Study designPrognostic model development; internal validation and external validation using routineprimary care research data (ResearchOne); linked datasets (SAIL databank and LDM) and cohortstudy data (CARE75+); with integrated Decision Analytic Modelling; including health economicanalysis.Databases1.

Community Ageing Research 75+ (CARE75+) cohortNational prospective cohort study (nâ‰ˆ1;200) collecting detailed sociodemographic information;frailty measures (including eFI scores); simple instruments suitable for use in primary care(e.g. gait speed; timed-up-and-go test; activities of daily living; informal care;loneliness); and key outcomes at six; 12; 24 and 48 months. CARE75+ is a very rich datasetthat provides a highly efficient method to investigate how simple instruments might augmenteFI performance.Eligible populationPatients â‰¥65 years with moderate frailty (eFI score 0.24 to 0.36) or severe frailty (eFIscore >0.36) and registered with a ResearchOne; SAIL or LDM practice on 1st April 2018.All CARE75+ participants with moderate frailty (eFI score 0.24 to 0.36) or severe frailty(eFI score >0.36) will be eligible.Outcomes for risk prediction (all 12 months)-New or increased home care package-ED attendance/hospitalisation with fall or fracture-Nursing home admission-All-cause mortalityPredictorsComponents of the eFI; supplemented with variables available within routine primary care EHRdata and clinical assessment measures practical for use in primary care.Prognostic modelsEach prognostic model will be developed and internally validated in just one of thedatabases; and then externally validated in a second databaseSample size for prognostic model developmentSAIL and ResearchOne extracts will each include â‰ˆ600;000 patients aged 65 or over; with anestimated 72;000 having moderate frailty; and 24;000 severe frailty. LDM extract will includeâ‰ˆ150;000 patients aged 65 or over; with an estimated 18;000 having moderate frailty and 6;000severe frailty.For model development; a key indicator of the effective sample size is the number of outcomeevents. Previous research into the outcomes of interest; and feasibility estimates usingCARE75+; ResearchOne and SAIL; inform estimates for anticipated number of events within 12months.-New or increased home care package: Anticipated 15;864 events in SAIL; based on 14.9% 12month incidence in moderate frailty group (10;080 events); and 24.1% 12 month incidencein severe frailty group (5;784 events).-ED attendance/hospitalisation with fall or fracture: Anticipated 8;064 events in SAIL;based on 7.4% 12 month incidence in moderate frailty group (5;328 events) and 11.4%incidence in severe frailty (2;736 events).-Nursing home admission: Anticipated 2;160 events in ResearchOne; based on 2.0% 12 monthincidence in moderate frailty group (1;440 events) and 3.8% 12 month incidence in severefrailty group (720 events).-All-cause mortality: Anticipated 12;216 events in ResearchOne; based on 10.6% 12 monthincidence in moderate frailty group (7;632 events) and 19.1% 12 month incidence severefrailty group (4;584 events).Therefore; even when taking the lowest estimate of incident events by 12 months (for nursinghome admission); for each outcome the investigators would expect at least 2;160 events ineach of ResearchOne or SAIL. This enables us to robustly estimate a prognostic model for eachoutcome even with up to 108 predictor parameters; corresponding to 20 events per potentialpredictor parameter (2160/20). This exceeds 'rule-of-thumb' recommendations of 10 or 15events per predictor parameter.Furthermore; conservatively assuming the new models will have a Nagelkerke R-squared of 15%;Riley's sample size formula suggests that at least 7.5 events for each predictor parameterwill ensure overfitting and optimism are minimized; when the outcome proportion is 3%. Whenincreasing outcome proportion to 20% (home care package); 9% (fall/fracture); or 15%(mortality); the minimum sample size required is 18; 11.5 and 15 events per predictorparameter; respectively. The investigators exceed all these; due to the large datasetsavailable.Sample size for external validationCurrent recommendations are that at least 100 events and 100 non-events (ideally 200) arerequired for prognostic model external validation. Our estimates indicate considerably morethan this; such as 2160 events for the least prevalent outcome of care home admission in SAILand ResearchOne; and 540 in LDM (which will only be used for external validation of models).Missing dataHandled using multiple imputation and Rubin's rules; under a missing at random assumption;including outcome in the imputation model; accounting for practice clustering.Analysis plani) Prognostic modellingThe investigators will build 4 separate prognostic models within the development datasets topredict risk of our 4 key stated outcomes in individuals with moderate or severe frailty asthe startpoint.For each outcome; for those with moderate frailty (eFI score 0.24 to 0.36) or severe frailty(eFI score >0.36) the investigators will develop and internally validate a prognostic modelcontaining just eFI (as a whole as it currently stands) and then containing components of eFI(included as predictors) along with additional routine primary care EHR data. The regressionmodel will be logistic regression or flexible parametric survival; for binary ortime-to-event outcomes (as appropriate when the investigators observe the database coding andcensoring etc.); to produce outcome risks by 12 months.Due to the large sample size; overfitting is expected to be small; but the investigators willadjust for it using penalisation via a global shrinkage factor estimated via bootstrapping.Where variable selection is considered important for parsimony; the investigators will ratheruse penalisation via elastic net. Internal validation will use bootstrapping of the entiredevelopment dataset; and optimism-adjusted estimates of predictive performance produced forcalibration (e.g. calibration-in-the-large; calibration slope; Observed/Expected);discrimination (e.g. C-statistic) and overall (e.g. Nagelkerke R2) performance of predictedrisks. Continuous variables will not be categorised and potential non-linear effects examinedusing splines or fractional polynomials. Non-proportional hazards for predictors will also beexamined with interaction terms with time.All models will be externally validated in a different database. Predictive performancestatistics will be derived as described above (e.g. C-statistic; calibration slope);alongside calibration plots showing agreement between observed and predicted risks; acrossthe spectrum of predicted risks; using a loess non-parameter smoother.Separately; the investigators will use the CARE75+ dataset to investigate the additionalpredictive power of clinical assessment measures of prognostic factors identified from thereviews that are practical for use in routine primary care.ii) Decision modellingPrognostic models will be translated into a framework to guide clinical decision making byidentifying relevant thresholds of predicted risk; above which implementation of our statedinterventions is warranted. This will allow us to generate a decision analytic model (DAM);which will be examined using decision curves and net benefit in the external validationdatasets.iii) Health economic evaluationThe health economic evaluation will be conducted in two stages. The objective of the firststage is to provide a short-term; 12-month comparison of the cost-effectiveness of thescenarios identified by the DAM. For the second stage; the investigators will extend ouranalysis to a long-term cost-effectiveness evaluation of these scenarios.,TRUE,prognostic,development; validation,Enrolling by invitation,NA,2019-09-02,2019-10-02,2019-10-23,Observational [Patient Registry],NA,NA,Frailty,NA,Number of participants admitted to nursing homes.

This research will characterize BDNF methylation during recovery from TBI inchildren and investigate this novel biomarker as a potential biological mechanism underlyingthe known association between childhood adversity and poorer neurobehavioral outcomesfollowing TBI in childhood. Findings from this research will contribute to an improvedunderstanding of why some children display good recovery following TBI; whereas many otherssuffer from chronic neurobehavioral impairments.; Unexplained heterogeneity in outcomes following pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is oneof the most critical barriers to the development of effective prognostic tools andtherapeutics. The addition of personal biological factors to our prediction models mayaccount for a significant portion of unexplained variance and advance the field towardsprecision rehabilitation medicine. The overarching goal of the Epigenetic Effects onPediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Recovery (EETR) study is to investigate an epigeneticbiomarker involved in both childhood adversity and post-injury neuroplasticity to betterunderstand heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes following pediatric TBI. The primaryhypothesis is that childhood adversity will be associated with poorer neurobehavioralrecovery in part through an epigenetically mediated reduction in brain-derived neurotrophicfactor (BDNF) expression in response to TBI.EETR is an observational; prospective; longitudinal concurrent cohort study of children aged3-18 years with either TBI (n=200) or orthopedic injury (n=100); recruited from the UPMCChildren's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Participants complete study visits acutely and at 6- and12-months post-injury. Blood and saliva biosamples are collected at all time points-and CSFwhen available acutely-for epigenetic and proteomic analysis of BDNF. Additional measuresassess injury characteristics; pre- and post-injury child neurobehavioral functioning;childhood adversity; and potential covariates/confounders.

The results obtained are therefore often betterdesigned for primary prevention use. The prediction of mortality risk in patients withcomplications and requiring hospital follow-up is less well known.The study purpose is to determine a mortality risk profile in a hospital cohort of patientswith pathologies associated with metabolic diseases.Today the multimaker scores based on a panel of biomarkers - have significantly improvedthe discriminating power of prediction models existing in many pathologies. It is no longer asingle biomarker that can improve risk prediction but a complete and cross-sectional profilethat is sought after. We aim to establish a personalised mortality risk profile by combiningclinical and biological parameters including metabolomics; genetics; transcriptomics andepigenomics by high throughput screening of biological samples.; The prediction of the onset of diabetes and metabolic complications; especiallycardiovascular; renal; or hepatic; is a major challenge to optimize the management of thisdisease.Teams from the University Hospital of Lille have developed the Integra cohort study toidentify the clinical and biological determinants of the occurrence of these complicationsand the mortality of patients with metabolic disorders.The aim of the study is to identify clinico-biological determinants that are able to predictthe occurence of death; cardiovascular events as well as hepatic or nephrotic one.Follow-up data will be collected from National System of Health Data (SNDS) where dataconcerning hospitalisations; medical consultations and treatments are registered.Biological samples are collected at baseline for a large OMICs analysis (metabolomics;genetics; transcriptomics and epigenomics) that would feed our predictive scoring system.This project will allow us to describe new models of prediction of metabolic diseases and itscomplications; and to offer adapted and personalised methods of management; which can slowthe progression of the disease and improve its prognosis.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2019-12-09,2019-12-11,2020-11-18,Observational,NA,NA,Metabolic Diseases,Diabetic|CardioVascular Disease|morbi-mortality|Hospital Cohort,number of death; The number of patients dead according to national database,Occurrence of macrovascular complications (composite criteria) hospitalization for heart failure Occurence of renal microvasculare complications (composite criteria) Occurrence of liver complications(composite endpoint) Occurrence of hemorrhages measured by BARC >3 bleeding; composite criteria: cardiovascular death; myocardial infarction; stroke; coronary revascularization; peripheral revascularization; amputation) The number of patients that has been hospitalized for heart failure since the end of the study according to national database composite criteria: renal transplantation; dialysis; GFR >60; Albuminuria composite endpoint: hepatic fibrosis; cirrhosis; HCC; death from liver composite endpoint : CABG-related bleeding (Perioperative intracranial bleeding within 48 h / Reoperation after closure of sternotomy for the purpose of controlling bleeding / Transfusion of<5 U whole blood or packed red blood cells within a 48-hperiod / Chest tube output>=2L within a 24-h period)or Fatal Bleeding (Probable fatal bleeding; no autopsy or imaging confirmation butclinically suspicious / Definite fatal bleeding; overt bleeding or autopsy or imagingconfirmation),1234,1234,1234,1234,11,12,2019,blah,1234,1234,1234

Surgical resection is the conventionaltreatment for early and intermediate stage CRC; chemotherapy is the main treatment for latestage CRC.Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is tumor-derived fragmented DNA with an average size of 170bp;mixed with cell free DNA (cfDNA) of other sources in blood circulation. Although themechanisms of its release have not been fully addressed; apoptosis and/or necrosis of tumorcells and serum exosome are considered as its main source; which makes it a genomic reservoirof different tumor clones. Also; as its half-life is up to hours; ctDNA is reflecting themost up-to-date status of tumor genome. Hence; it allows for noninvasive molecularcharacterization of tumors;which can be qualitative; quantitative and used for diseasemonitoring. The possibility of that ctDNA could be used to detect micrometastatic disease inpatients received surgical resection was suggested in several studies. Using Next GenerationSequencing (NGS); Newman et al. have shown that the serum level of ctDNA was correlated withtumor progress and prognosis in NSCLC. Isaac et al. demonstrated the postoperative ctDNAlevel was associated with breast cancer progression; and it was more sensitive compared to CTscan for predicting the early relapse. Tie et al. examined the postoperative ctDNA level of1046 plasma samples from a prospective cohort of 230 patients with resected stage II CRC byNGS; and their results demonstrated that recurrence happened in 79% of the patients withpositive postoperative ctDNA at median follow-up of 27 months; versus 9.8% in the negativepostoperative ctDNA group.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Unknown status,Recruiting,2019-10-28,2020-01-14,2020-01-14,Observational [Patient Registry],NA,NA,Colorectal Neoplasms,NA,prediction accuracy of survival rate. prediction accuracy of recurrent rate; We will use the gene mutation data and follow-up data of the patients to construct a prediction model;the accuracy of model to anticipating the 5 year survival rate of patients is the primary endpoint We will use the gene mutation data and follow-up data of the patients to construct a prediction model;the accuracy of model to anticipating the 3 year recurrent rate of patients is the primary endpoint,Mutation Consistency of tissue and blood sample; We do NGS sequencing of both the tissue sample and blood sample of the CRC patients.

In addition;pathophysiological mechanisms and differences in mild and severe variants of COVID-19 as wellas in the control group can be extensively studied in a multidisciplinary approach.; Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a major and imminent challenge for healthcare systems regarding patient triage and allocation of limited resources worldwide; but alsoin Switzerland. Data from severly affected countries impressively demonstrate that COVID-19fatality rates rapidly increase in times of overloaded health care services. Cardiovascularcomorbidity seems to be associated with impaired outcome; e.g. with admission to intensivecare unit (ICU) or death. However; a direct causal relation is questionable andpathophysiological mechanisms of the cardiovascular involvement such as therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are poorly understood. The clinical value of establishedand emerging biomarkers is largely unknown. Accordingly; early and reliable personalized riskprediction represents a major unmet clinical need; as it may allow evidence-based clinicaldecision aid for most effective resource allocation in the common fight against the COVID-19pandemic.Aims: To fill these gaps in knowledge; investigators designed the COronaVIrus surviVAl(COVIVA) study. With this study; investigators aim to deliver an open-source platform to i)perform extensive clinical and biomarker phenotyping in COVID-19 suspects presenting to theemergency department (ED) and in COVID-19 patients with subsequent ICU admission; ii) compareclinical and biomarker profiles of COVID-19 patients with a control group; iii) derive andvalidate personalized risk prediction models for early clinical decision support; and iv)explore pathophysiological mechanisms including inflammatory and cardiovascular pathways.Methodology: The COVIVA study is an ongoing; prospective; interdisciplinary; observational;case-control study with active enrolment of consecutive patients with clinical suspicion ofCOVID-19 triaged to the Emergency Department (ED) of the University Hospital in Basel;Switzerland. Patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab test for severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 will serve as cases while the remainders will serve as controls.Detailed clinical patient's phenotyping (e.g. comorbidities; medications; symptoms; vitals;ECG and imaging data); extended laboratory analyses and blood sampling for bio banking areperformed once in all patients (cases and control) at time of ED presentation and seriallythereafter in the subset of COVID-19 patients with subsequent need for ICU admission. Primaryoutcome measure is in-hospital mortality; secondary outcome measures include the need for ICUadmission; invasive mechanical ventilation; hemodynamic support; 30-day post-dischargemortality; length of hospital and ICU stay; resource use and quality of life 30 days afterdischarge and its composites. Personalized risk prediction models will be derived andvalidated based on advanced statistical models including machine-based learning incorporatinga variety of clinical parameters and biomarker signatures (including digitally storedin-hospital data; e.g. imaging; ECG; ventilation parameters).

To investigate the still largely unknown pathophysiology of this disease; we havebuilt a consortium of Italian Hospitals to include a large cohort of COVID-19 patients frommild out-patients managed by GPs to inpatients developing mild; moderate or severe diseaseassessed both in hospital and at a 3-6 month follow-up visit). Consortium partners have awide expertise to allow for 1) comprehensive assessment of risk factors for severe COVID-19syndrome; 2) study the pathophysiology of its cardio-respiratory manifestations; 3) estimaterisk scores also with artificial intelligence and 4) assess its clinical immunoinflammatoryand cardiorespiratory sequelae in discharged patients at short term follow-up. To this aim;we will1. Enroll around 5500 COVID-19 patients (1000 outpatients and 4500 in-patients); which willallow to:1.1 Phenotype patients with COVID-19 of variable severity 1.2 Assess the prevalence ofCOVID-19 among GPs in relation with their use of PPE 1.3 Evaluate the impact ofpatients' demographic and clinical characteristics COVID-19 severity2. Use an electronic CRF (on RedCap) to record clinical; biohumoral and imaging data ofinpatients with COVID-19 of various severity to explore the prognostic andpathophysiological role of immunologic factors; activation of blood coagulation;endothelial dysfunction; inflammatory response; genetic (ni particular X-linked);hormonal and metabolic factors; comorbidities and acute cardiac damage. Blood sampleswill be collected. We will also use machine learning techniques to develop multivariablemodels for patients' risk stratification3. A follow-up visit at 3-6 months after discharge will be performed to identify residualclinical consequences that might affect long-term prognosis.; BackgroundCOVID-19 has shown a lower case-fatality rate compared to other major viral outbreaks incontemporary history; including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of 2002-2003.However; the relative susceptibility to symptomatic infection and the case fatality riskincrease substantially after 60 years of age; in men; and in overweight patients; raisingquestions about the underlying biology of host responses. This includes possible geneticderterminants of sex bias. Cardiac involvement; as characterized; by elevation of cardiacTroponin I and brain-type; natriuretic peptide; is frequent in COVID-19 and it is associatedwith worse prognosis. Myocardial injury and heart failure accounted for 40% of deaths in aWuhan cohort; either exclusively or in conjunction with respiratory failure. Thus; it seemsthat cardiac involvement is both prevalent and of prognostic significance in COVID-19.However; both the actual incidence of myocardial injury (biomarkers elevation may simplyreflect systemic illness in critically-ill patients) and the pathophysiology of cardiacinvolvement remain to be clarified. The SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts through the structuralglycopeptides of the crown spikes with its cellular target that; in humans; is theangiotensin2 (ACE2) converting enzyme; expressed in particular in the heart and lungs. ACE2is used by SARS-CoV-2 to be internalized by alveolar epithelial cells. Therefore; chronicintake of ACE inhibitors; or sartans; may influence the course of the COVID-19 diseasebecause an increased expression of ACE2 (such as that induced by ACEi therapy) couldfacilitate the internalization of the virus and the progression of infection. However; theinfection by the virus leads to the down-regulation of ACE2. The imbalance between ACE andACE2 leads to an increase in angiotensin II; which binds AT1R; which increases pulmonaryvascular permeability and lung damage. Thus; the role ACEi and ARBs on the susceptibility toSARS-COv-2 infection remain to be clarified.COVID-19 is characterized by changes in heart rate and cardiac autonomic modulation; systemicactivation of inflammatory processes; with endothelial damage and involvement ofcardiovascular (CV) and respiratory systems. Although most patients remain asymptomatic ormildly symptomatic; in a subset of them the host inflammatory response continues to amplifywith progressive lymphocytopenia; high white blood cells and neutrophil counts; to end-upwith a systemic inflammation characterized by multiple organ failure and elevation of keyinflammation markers (e.g. interleukin; tumor necrosis factor; interferon-y inducibleprotein; etc.). These biomarkers are not just indicators of inflammation; but are alsoassociated with prognosis. Patients who died of COVID-19 showed higher levels of IL-6;ferritin and CRP. Moreover; biomarkers of myocardial injury and ECG abnormalities wereassociated with elevated inflammatory markers suggesting an indirect mechanism of cardiacinjury. However; recent data have demonstrated the presence of the virus within themyocardium of some COVID-19 pts; implicating also direct myocardial injury. Also low Vit.D;with immunomodulating action; is associated with poor outcome. Another interesting aspect ofthe complex pathophysiology of COVID-19 is the finding that 71.4% of nonsurvivors and 0.6% ofsurvivors in a Wuhan hospital showed overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Itis well known that sepsis is a common cause of DIC and inflammatory cytokines can promote theactivation of blood coagulation in many ways. However; whether SARS-Cov-2 is more prone toDIC development and the role of anticoagulation in determining the prognosis in COVID-19 needto be established. Finally; no data is available on the short-term sequelae in COVID-19 ptsafter discharge; in terms of residual structural and functional cardiorespiratory damage andits determinants (viral; inflammatory; metabolic and pro-thrombotic factors).Hyphotesis and SignificanceWe hypothesize that COVID-19 could represent a new CV risk factor inducing acute andchronic CV changes able to affect clinical evolution and long term prognosis. Suggestedimportant mechanisms of COVID-19 severity related to injury of CV and respiratory systemsinclude: 1) a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm; with endothelial damage and DIC; 2) patients'demographic and clinical features (age; sex; body mass index; genetic factors; autonomiccardiac modulation; medical history in particular diabetes and CV diseases; sleep disorderedbreathing; low vitamin D levels; thyroid dysfunction; and current drug treatment); 3)evidence of cardiac damage during course of the disease. All these possible determinants ofCOVID-19 severity need to be systematically evaluated according to an integrated approach ina large number of patients developing COVID-19 of different severity; including inpatientsand outpatients. Given the complexity of the hypothesized multifold pathogenetic mechanisms;also approaches to data analysis through artificial intelligence (machine learningalgorithms) may allow to develop multivariable models to 1) effectively risk stratifypatients to identify those at highest risk requiring more intensive support; 2) Promptlyrecognize patients most vulnerable for adverse outcomes; to prioritize palliative care andimprove cost/effectiveness of healthcare resources deployed. Finally; no information is yetavailable on the short term residual structural and functional consequences on the immune; CVand respiratory systems following discharge of COVID-19 patients who have recovered fromacute disease.Preliminary DataIn spite of the widespread use of mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19 andhypoxemia; hypoventilation is uncommon in these patients. Conversely; hypoxemia is usuallyaccompanied by an increased alveolar-to arterial O2 gradient; signifying eitherventilation-perfusion mismatch or intra-pulmonary shunting. The presence of a significantventilation-perfusion mismatch is further supported in COVID-19 patients by the increase ofPaO2 with supplemental oxygen. Whereas; when PaO2 does not increase with supplemental oxygen;presence of intra-pulmonary shunt is the most likely cause of hypoxemia. Moreover;preliminary data from China indicate that 71.4% of nonsurvivors and 0.6% of survivors in aWuhan hospital showed evidence of DIC. One critical mediator of DIC is the release of tissuefactor (TF); a glycoprotein activator of blood coagulation cascade present on surface of manyactivated cell types; and of circulating microvesicles (MV). COVID-19 appears characterizedby predominantly pro-thrombotic DIC with high venous thromboembolism rates; elevated D-dimerand fibrinogen levels in concert with low anti-thrombin levels; and pulmonary congestion withmicrovascular thrombosis and occlusion on pathology and evidence of ischemic limbs; stroke;myocardial infarction in critically ill patients. D-dimer is a biomarker of coagulationactivation triggered by TF but it does not identify per se the molecular mechanisms (venousor arterial) and/or the dysfunctional cell population involved. MVs have received increasingattention as novel players in CV disease (CVD). A subgroup of procoagulant MVs express alsoTF; predict CV events and identify patients at high recurrence risk. COVID-19 clinicalmanifestations are also similar to those of other autoimmune/inflammatory disorders in whicha thrombophilic vasculopathy is sustained by systemic inflammation; with activation of thecomplement cascade. Also low levels of Vit D and thyroid dysfunction seem to characterizemore severe disease. However; the cross-link between inflammation and coagulation; as well asthe role of host biology; previous treatments and clinical history in modulating the clinicalcourse of COVID-19 remain to be clarified.Aims1. To investigate the epidemiological link of patients' clinical characteristics (gender;BMI; age; presence of CV risk factors; ongoing treatment; underlying CV diseases andmyocardial injury) with outcomes.2. To evaluate the pathophysiological role of: 1) activation of immune system and hostinflammatory response; 2) activation of thrombotic and coagulation factors andendothelial damage (with possible DIC; 3) metabolic and endocrinologic factors;including thyroid dysfunction; low Vit.D (vs ARDS); 4) occurrence of sleep relatedbreathing disorders and alterations in autonomic cardiac modulation; 5) genetic X-linkedfactors related to ACE2 expression and to gender bias 6) cardiac structural andfunctional changes as assessed by cardiac ultrasounds and MRI. Artificial intelligencemethods will also be applied to risk-stratify patients affected by SARS-Cov-23. To identify the persistence of viral load; immunologic or coagulation alterations(plasma; cell or MV-related); and respiratory and cardiovascular consequences ofCOVID-19; by clinical/instrumental follow-up assessment at 3-6 months after dischargeSample sizeFor Aim 1; in this epidemiologic survey we expect to include about 5500 patients: 4500in-patients and 1000 out-patients. For Aim 2 and 3; because the context is underpinned byrelatively sparse knowledge; ours will be considered as pilot assessments with no formalsample size calculation. For Aim 3 we will include roughly 3000 discharged patients Specificaim 1. Patients will be divided in two groups to identify outcome predictors. a) controls:individuals who did not develop severe COVID-19; b) cases: individuals who developed severedisease. The lack of enough knowledge in COVID- 19 patients about predictors of outcomelimits the performance of standard regression models. Machine learning techniques canfacilitate the objective interpretation of medical observations in building risk score. Inparticular; a combination of association rule mining with the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)can compute probabilistic associations between clinical features and outcomes.Statistical analysisSpecific aim 2.To identify the relationship between each potential group of predictors andin-patients prognosis; we will apply multivariate logistic regression models. All associationestimates will be reported as Odds Ratio (OR) and relative 95% confidence intervals. Toaddress the problem of variable selection in high dimensional data (numerous predictors andconfounders); we will use a new statistical approach based on random forest. To overcomeproblems due to uncommon outcome we will consider alternative regression model aslog-binomial and Poisson regression with robust variance The development of amachine-learning algorithm to identify a new score of prognosis will be based on the aboveresults and conducted on a subsample of in-patients with all potential predictors andphenotype. The sample will be randomly divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) set.The training set will be used to build the score applying several machine learningalgorithms. The score with the best predictive performance (C-index) on the validation setwill be chosen by means of the two-tailed adequate hypothesis testing of equal predictiveperformance assuming I error type of 0.05 and power of 80%. When the null hypothesis will notbe refused; the parsimony criterion will be applied.Specific aim 3. To characterize patients at follow-up in terms of viral load and alterationsof immune or coagulative systems and respiratory/cardiovascular consequences; we will applygeneralized linear mixed models which take into account the correlated response during timeof the same patient; modeling appropriately the variance-covariance matrix of repeatedmeasurements.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Active; not recruiting,NA,2020-04-28,2020-05-01,2021-02-09,Observational,NA,NA,COVID-19,Angiotensin receptor-blocker|ACE inhibitors drugs|Co-morbidities|Inflammatory cytokines|Genetic factors|Metabolic factors|Cardiac damage|Artificial Intelligence,Predictive modeling of in-hospital outcome.

The investigators aim to determine; whether the addition ofSmartWatches enhances risk stratification; early detection of complications and prognosticsin patients with COVID-19; who have cardiovascular diseases or receive medication witharrhythmogenic risk.The study is a monocentric observational study in the sense of a cohort study. 50 COVID-19patients are aimed to be included. Patients are identified upon presentation at the COVID-19outpatient clinic or during their stay at the COVID-19 ward at the Centre for InternalMedicine (Krehl-Klinik) at the Heidelberg University Hospital.Since many study-relevant data are routinely collected at presentation in the outpatientclinic or during the inpatient stay; these values are being accessed (e.g. anamnesis;physical examination; ECGs; CT and laboratory values) by our study team.The recruited subjects (n=50) receive medical care according to the instructions of thetreating physicians. The treating physicians decide whether a home or inpatient quarantine isnecessary and whether a specific therapy is required.SmartWatches are provided to all subjects on the day of recruitment. These are Apple Watches(Series 5). The patient is asked to record an ECG on the Apple Watch 5 times a day (8:00 am;11:00 am; 2:00 pm; 5:00 pm; 8:00 pm).

Among the complications of dengue fever; a frequentcomplication is the shock linked to capillary leakage which often occurs at the time ofdefervescence between the 3rd or 5th day of evolution of the fever. Before that; it isdifficult to identify patients who are at risk for severe forms. Patients are therefore seenregularly to monitor for the development of serious forms; which causes saturation of thehealth system. Despite everything; with each epidemic; the investigators observe deaths ofpreviously healthy people; which always constitutes an important trauma for the populationand for the carers. Improving the understanding of the pathophysiology of capillary leakageand the tools to predict it would be significant advances in this common tropical pathology.Thus a retrospective study of longitudinal data during the dengue 2 epidemic of 2013 made itpossible to generate precise hypotheses as to the pathophysiology of the shock linked tocapillary leakage. Hypoprotidemia and hyponatremia having a strong statistical associationwith the subsequent occurrence of shock; the hypothesis is of a progressive disturbance ofthe plasma osmolarity resulting in water leaks towards the interstitial sector.These preliminary data also made it possible to develop a predictive score which must now bevalidated over time.Research involving the human person; monocentric; prospective; validationInterventional research protocol involving the human person category 2 at risk and minimalconstraints,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2020-06-05,2020-06-09,2020-12-09,Interventional,N/A,Diagnostic,Dengue|Fever,Dengue|Dengue fever|Children|Adults|French Guiana|Hypovolemic shock|Osmolarity|Hyponatremia|Hypoprotidemia|Clinical-biological score|Interstitial fluid,Occurrence of a shock; The primary outcome measure will be the occurrence of a shock defined by systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg in adults and <80 mm Hg in children.,Predictive value of plasma hypo-osmolarity Validation of the clinical-biological prognostic score Relationship between the measurements obtained by osmolarity and capillary leakage Evaluation of the sensitivity / specificity and predictive values of osmolarity and capillary leakage How long before the shock these measures (osmolarity; score) allow to predict an unfavorable evolution Association between the factor Presence of sickle cell disease and occurrence of severe dengue; Evaluate the predictive value of plasma hypo-osmolarity in the occurrence of shock during dengue Prospectively validate the clinical-biological prognostic score (2013 shock score) and; if possible; improve it Study the relationship between the measurements obtained by osmolarity and capillary leakage measured by pleural effusion Evaluation of the sensitivity / specificity and predictive values of these measures in relation to the ultrasound objectification of a pleural effusion Specify how long before the shock these measures (osmolarity; score) allow to predict an unfavorable evolution Study the association between the factor Presence of sickle cell disease and occurrence of severe dengue,1234,1234,1234,1234,9,6,2020,blah,1234,1234,1234
NCT04493710,Retrospective Analysis of Sarcopenia in Older Patients Undergoing Laparotomy-; Retrospective Analysis of Sarcopenia in Older Patients Undergoing Laparotomy,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Number of participants who die between zero and thirty days. Number of participants who die between zero and ninety days; Post-operative death Post-operative death<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Assess the influence of sarcopenia on outcomes of emergency laparotomy in the over 65 agegroup; Emergency laparotomy is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. These risks areincreased in the elderly population with a third of over-80s dying within thirty days ofsurgery; rising to 50% at 1-year post emergency laparotomy. Many patients are frail and havemultiple co-morbidities; often with coexistent malnutrition and so present a significantchallenge in the emergency surgery setting. The National Emergency Laparotomy Audit hasreported that greater than half of patients undergoing emergency laparotomy in the UK areover-65 years of age and are the highest risk patients with the highest mortality. Thisgroup; therefore; is one in which accurate prognostication is desirable to allow optimaltreatment decisions; provision of critical care treatment; and resource allocation.A number of multivariate risk prediction models exist including POSSUM; P-POSSUM andAPACHE-II with on-going modification of P-POSSUM as part of the National Emergency LaparotomyAudit(NELA). Whilst such models are commonly used; evidence suggests that they may be lessaccurate in elderly patients; a group which offer difficult decision-making problems to thesurgeon. Frailty is the lack of physiological functional reserve and is commonplace in elderlypatients. It has profound effects on the ability to withstand and recover from emergencysurgery. Despite this; frailty does not form part of the commonly used multivariate riskprediction models.Sarcopenia is the progressive and global loss of skeletal muscle mass as well as reduction instrength and is closely linked to frailty. Multiple methods of quantifying skeletal musclemass and therefore sarcopenia have been defined; but calculation of psoas majorcross-sectional area on pre-operative CT imaging may be the most pragmatic in the emergencysetting due to routine use of pre-operative CT imaging prior to emergency laparotomy.Measurement of the psoas major as a marker of sarcopenia has been shown to predict outcomesin a wide range of surgical specialties. However; there is no consensus as to how this markerof sarcopenia should be used in surgical practice.Proposal- To assess the utility of psoas major measurement to predict outcomes followingemergency laparotomy in older patients and whether it could enhance the accuracy of mortalityprediction when combined with P-POSSUM model variables.Methods An analysis of data collected as part of the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit wasconducted. Data were collected from patients over the age of 65 who underwent emergencylaparotomy in Merseyside; United Kingdom between 2014 and 2018. Patients who underwentpre-operative cross-sectional imaging with abdominal CT pre-operatively were included in theanalysis.Demographic; histological; clinical; biochemical and operative data were collected andanalysed by accessing patient clinical notes and electronic records.Outcome measures included inpatient mortality; 30-day mortality and 90-day mortality.Radiological Analysis Pre-operative CT imaging of the abdomen were accessed and analysed.Cross-sectional images at the level of the L3 inferior end plate were analysed.Cross-sectional area of the psoas major and L3 vertebral body (mm2) were calculated and aratio of psoas major to L3 cross-sectional area calculated (PML3) . Higher PML3 valuesindicate higher levels of skeletal muscle mass. Cross-sectional area calculation wasconducted using the area of interest tool.Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis for continuous variables was conducted usingMann-Whitney U test and Chi-squared test for categorical variables. Receiver operatingcharacteristics curves were used for analysis of association of PML3 with mortality.Multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression analysis. Logisticregression models were produced including P-POSSUM variables with and without the inclusionof PML3. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the respective logistic regressionmodels were conducted to assess whether the addition of PML3 enhanced mortality prediction.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Recruiting,NA,2020-07-20,2020-07-30,2020-10-06,Observational [Patient Registry],NA,NA,Sarcopenia|Emergencies|Frailty,surgery|laparotomy|emergency|sarcopenia|frailty|mortality|risk,Number of participants who die between zero and thirty days.

Its originality lies upon the combination of three different andcomplementary prospective approaches: from the molecular analyses of biopsies sampled beforeand after NAC; from in vitro BC Patient-Derived Organoids (PDO) mimicking patient's responseto NAC; and from Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) isolated before/during/after NAC.; Breast cancer (BC) is a major public health problem in France; with an increasing incidence;estimated at ~60;000 new cases in 2017 and 12;000 deaths. Despite survival improvement in therecent years; resistance to chemotherapy (CT) remains a paramount challenge in <br><br>BC: themolecular mechanisms remain poorly known and the current interventions are inadequate totarget chemoresistance. Neo-adjuvant chimiotherapy (NAC) is now used increasingly in womenwith operable but aggressive BC such as triple-negative (TN) or HER2+ tumor (Pusztai et al;Lancet Oncol 2019). It provides at least three advantages: i) tumor debulking authorizingconservative surgery; ii) tailoring of adjuvant systemic therapy according to thepathological response; with delivery of capecitabine in TN patients (Masuda N. et al; N EnglJ Med. 2017) and T-DM1 in HER2+ patients (von Minckwitz G et al.; N Engl J Med. 2019) in theabsence of pathological complete response (pCR); and iii) providing resources forinvestigating the molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance. The current standard NAC regimenis based on a sequential association of anthracycline and taxane (and trastuzumab if HER2+)(Huober & von Minckwitz; Breast Care 2011); and the achievement of pCR; defined as theabsence of residual invasive cancer on pathological evaluation of the operative specimen(resected breast specimen and sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes (i.e.; ypT0/Tis ypN0 in theAJCC staging system); is a good-prognosis feature; the patients without pCR being at highrelapse risk (â‰ˆ50% of the TN and HER2+ subtypes).The major bottleneck in improving treatment efficiency for these patients is theidentification of candidates effectively involved in the resistance to NAC; their validationin relevant and predictive models; and their detection from surrogate markers. Of course; thesearch for molecular alterations differentially represented in the pre-NAC samples betweenthe resistant (no pCR) versus sensitive (pCR) patients; or between the paired post- versuspre-NAC samples may reveal candidates involved in resistance (innate and acquired stablerespectively); but ignores the alterations that occur during the NAC that may be reversible(acquired reversible) and not identified in the resected specimen (Echeverria GV; SciTransl Med 2019); but only identifiable by analysis of serial samples during NAC regimen;difficult and traumatic in clinical practice.The present project aims at identifying robust candidates for drug resistance in BC patientseligible for NAC. Its originality lies upon the combination of three different andcomplementary prospective approaches: from the molecular analyses of biopsies sampled beforeand after NAC; from in vitro BC Patient-Derived Organoids (PDO) mimicking patient's responseto NAC; and from Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) isolated before/during/after NAC. Thisproject will combine the most advanced technologies (RNA and DNA-sequencing from small amountof biologic material; rare subsets/single-cell isolation; and multi-omics analyses) withinnovative models (drug testing on breast PDO; identification of reversible drug-inducedchanges) and clever combination of robust markers involved in drug resistance that have allbeen established and are running in the laboratory (cf Part B). The last two points have onlyrecently become feasible thanks to two recent technological advances: breast cancer PDOcultures (Sachs N; et al. Cell. 2018) and CTCs isolation and characterization (Gkountela S;et al. Cell. 2019). Briefly; the investigators will use serial tumor biopsies and bloodsamples from a cohort of BC patients treated with NAC (Figure 1). Tumor biopsies will becollected before and after NAC. They will be analyzed by RNA-seq and targeted-NGS (exome)approaches to capture the differences resulting from NAC in patients with differentpathological response. They will also be used to generate BC PDO models. The PDO modelspredictive for NAC response will be exploited as relevant models to investigate NACresistance. Specifically; investigators will use these models to look at in vitro acquiredreversible drug-induced resistance mechanisms (i.e only detectable during the drugexposure). Blood samples will be collected before; during; and after NAC to analyze CTCs; andaim at identifying acquired reversible drug-induced resistance mechanisms ex vivo; whichthe investigators might fail to detect with the before/after NAC samples only.To our knowledge; this is the first time that these three innovative approaches will be usedtogether to investigate in depth the topic of resistance in patients receiving NAC. Thestrength of this combination is to anticipate different - not mutually exclusive - situationsthat might occur (innate; acquired stable and/or reversible drug-induced resistance).Each approach will provide original; precise and specific information that will contribute tobuild a more complete answer to this question than the scattered and incomplete datacurrently available in the literature.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Not yet recruiting,NA,2020-08-05,2020-08-07,2020-08-14,Observational,NA,NA,Breast Neoplasms,NA,Identify robust candidates - innate; acquired stable and/or reversible; comparison of pre and/or post NAC molecular profiles in tumors; PDO models and CTCs - will be targeted with a drug in relevant models,public repertoire of whole transcriptome and targeted-NGS Identify molecular signatures associated with response to NAC Establish PDO samples exposed to NAC Evaluation of CTCs features; NAC database will be constructed from well documented RNAseq and targeted-NGS profiles established from serial HER2+ and TN tumors before/after NAC treatment Comparison of serial molecular profiles Percentage of PDO exposed to NAC that will parallel the patient's clinical response to NAC phenotype; RNA-seq-based transcriptome,1234,1234,1234,1234,7,8,2020,blah,1234,1234,1234

Numerous scientific data show that damage of thecoronary microcirculation (CM) during a STEMI remains a problem because the techniques formeasuring it are still imperfect. We have simple methods for estimating the damage to the MCduring the initial coronary angiography; the best known being the calculation of themyocardial blush grade (MBG); but which is semi-quantitative and therefore not very precise;or more precise imaging techniques; such as cardiac MRI; which are performed 48 hours afterthe infarction and which make the development of early applicable therapeutics not verypropitious. Finally; lately; the use of special coronary guides to measure a precise CM indexremains non-optimal because it prolongs the procedure. However; the information is in thepicture and this information could allow the development of therapeutic strategies adapted tothe patient's CM. Indeed; the arrival of iodine in CM increases the density of the pixels ofthe image; this has been demonstrated by the implementation in 2009 of a software allowingthe calculation of the MBG assisted by computer. But the performances of this software didnot allow its wide diffusion. Today; the field of medical image analysis presents dazzlingprogress thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). Deep Learning; a sub-category of MachineLearning; is probably the most powerful form of AI for automated image analysis today. Madeup of a network of artificial neurons; it allows; using a very large number of knownexamples; to extract the most relevant characteristics of the image to solve a given problem.Thus; it uses thousands of pieces of information; sometimes imperceptible to the naked eye.We hypothesize that a supervised Deep Learning algorithm trained with a set of relevant data;will be able to identify a patient with a pejorative prognosis; probably related to amicrocirculatory impairment visible in the image.; The aim of this study is to develop an algorithm capable of identifying patients with poorprognosis criteria at the time of hospitalization for STEMI; despite successfulrevascularization by analyzing coronary angiography images using supervised Deep Learningtype artificial intelligence methods.The protocol will be subdivided into 4 steps:- Step 1: Patient selectionData mining to identify and select patients via PMSI data. Patients will be contacted bytelephone follow-up to check the participation agreement and collect the primary outcome.Other data from the patient's medical file will be collected through PREDIMED.- Step 2: Data annotationTo identify for each patient with successful revascularization according to the usualcriteria (TIMI Flow = 3; MBG = 2 or 3 and ST segment resolution > 70%) whether or not he orshe presents; at the time of hospitalization for STEMI; pejorative evolution criteria definedby the occurrence of death or rehospitalization for heart Failure at the time of follow-up .This step requires the expertise of an angioplastician and will result in the generation of adatabase of 600 cases. To train the algorithm to recognize images in the context of STEMIrevascularization; 1000 normal coronary angiographies performed in a stable disease contextwill also be identified.- Step 3: Development of a new method for analyzing coronary angiography images to identifypatients with non-optimal revascularization.Develop using Tensorflow/Keras libraries a supervised Deep Learning AI algorithm trained toidentify patients with non-optimal revascularization (patient with poor prognosis). Thealgorithm will be based on convolutional neural network methodology and the model will betrained using data from the two previous steps. All or part of the sequence of interest willbe used at the input of the model which will propose at the output a probability of good orbad prognosis of the patient.The 1000 complementary coronary angiographies will be used toartificially increase the learning base by increasing the number of cases or will beexploited for a transfer learning method.- Step 4: Evaluation of the pathophysiological hypothesis.The main weakness of AI is the Black Box.

It will replace the current classification ofdiabetic retinopathy (DR) which provides an insufficient prediction precision. It will usemodern available fundus imaging devices and artificial intelligence (AI) to properlyintegrate the amount of data they provide with other medical data of the patient. A cohort of5000 diabetic patients will be recruited and followed for an average of 2 years in order tocollect data to train and validate the new prediction system.; A cohort of 5;000 diabetic patients with different stages of DR will be recruited andfollowed for an average of 2 years. Each year; general data as well as ophthalmological datawill be collected. Retinal images and videos of both eyes will be acquired using differentimaging modalities including ultrawidefield photography; OCT and OCT angiography. The EviRedcohort will be split in two groups: one group of 1;000 patients (validation cohort) will berandomly selected during the inclusion period by unbalanced draw to be representative of thegeneral diabetic population. Their data will be used for the validation of the algorithms.The data of the remaining 4;000 patients (training cohort) will be used to train thealgorithms. The main objective will be the validation of the prognostic tool and evaluate howaccurately the algorithm can predict progression to severe retinopathy in the following year.Secondary objectives will be to evaluate how accurately the algorithm can assess DR severityand individual components of DR complications as well as to compare prediction by algorithmto that made by ophthalmologists based on the current DR classification,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2020-09-07,2020-11-12,2021-10-22,Observational,NA,NA,Retinal Diseases|Diabetic Retinopathy,Diabetic retinopathy. .|Diabetes|Artificial intelligence.|Deep learning,Progression to severe retinopathy; Progression towards severe diabetic retinopathy form.,Algorithm performance Comparison of algorithms prediction to human prediction.; Algorithms will be evaluated by comparing the algorithm performance to automatically assess diabetic retinopathy severity as well as individual components of severe retinopathy against the same grading made by human graders. at each patient's visit of the validation cohort; ophthalmologists will evaluate the risk of DR progression based on the current DR classification and their clinical experience.

There are many riskfactors that affect the occurrence and death of cardiovascular diseases and malignant tumors.In addition to genetic and congenital factors; it also includes bad lifestyles; such assmoking; drinking; abnormal metabolism; excessive stress; etc. Many factors such as excessivestress and staying up late can cause abnormal circadian rhythms. The regulation of circadianrhythm is likely to be a key key to the early prevention of cardiovascular diseases andtumors.Melatonin has an important role in regulating the circadian rhythm of the human body. Thelatest research of our research group confirmed that melatonin can reduce the level ofoxidative stress through the retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor alpha (RORÎ±) andthereby inhibit pathological cardiac hypertrophy; melatonin can regulate the polarization andpolarization of macrophages RORÎ± receptor stabilizes vulnerable plaque in arteries andprevents plaque rupture.In China; melatonin is widely used in the market as a health product. However; the protectivemechanism of melatonin in cardiovascular diseases and tumors is still unclear; andlarge-scale population intervention studies are still lacking. The level of melatonin in thedaytime changes little with age; but the peak at night gradually decreases with age. Inpeople aged 60 and above; the peak of melatonin at night decreased significantly. Wespeculate that melatonin supplementation may be able to reduce the oxidative damage ofmitochondria by maintaining the level of melatonin at night in the body; delay cell decay;and delay this physiological process.Therefore; the project team intends to combine the developed new cardiovascular disease andtumor risk prediction models in the Shanghai elderly cohort established in the early stage;and randomize groups of healthy people in the same risk stratification; according to whetheror not to supplement melatonin. There are two cohorts: the melatonin intervention cohort andthe parallel control cohort. By observing the efficacy indicators of cardiovascular diseaseand tumor incidence in the two groups during the follow-up period; it provides evidence-basedmedical evidence for the future clinical application of melatonin.; Cardiovascular diseases and tumors seriously threaten human health. With the aging of thepopulation in my country; the number of patients with two diseases has been increasing yearby year; the difficulty of treatment has greatly increased; and the prognosis of mostpatients is poor. Therefore; it is of great clinical significance to explore safe andeffective intervention programs to prevent cardiovascular diseases and malignant tumors inthe elderly.There are many risk factors that affect the occurrence and death of cardiovascular diseasesand malignant tumors. In addition to genetic and congenital factors; it also includes badlifestyles; such as smoking; drinking; abnormal metabolism; excessive stress; etc. Manyfactors such as excessive stress and staying up late can cause abnormal circadian rhythms [5;6]. The regulation of circadian rhythm is likely to be a key key to the early prevention ofcardiovascular diseases and tumors.Melatonin has an important role in regulating the circadian rhythm of the human body. Anumber of basic and clinical studies at home and abroad have shown that melatonin has aprotective effect on inhibiting cardiovascular disease and tumor occurrence. The latestresearch of our research group confirmed that melatonin can reduce the level of oxidativestress through the retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor alpha (RORÎ±) and therebyinhibit pathological cardiac hypertrophy; melatonin can regulate the polarization andpolarization of macrophages RORÎ± receptor stabilizes vulnerable plaque in arteries andprevents plaque rupture.In China; melatonin is widely used in the market as a health product. Melatonin has a widerange of sources; no obvious toxic and side effects to the body; and high bioavailability;which suggests that it can prevent cardiovascular diseases and It has important potential inthe occurrence of tumors. However; the protective mechanism of melatonin in cardiovasculardiseases and tumors is still unclear; and large-scale population intervention studies arestill lacking. The level of melatonin in the daytime changes little with age; but the peak atnight gradually decreases with age. In people aged 60 and above; the peak of melatonin atnight decreased significantly.

The long-term objective is to facilitate moreefficient targeting of evidence-based relapse prevention strategies to these patients.; Most patients with depression are treated in primary care by general practitioners (GPs).Relapse of depression is common and leads to considerable morbidity and decreased quality oflife for patients. Estimates suggest that at least 50% of patients treated for depressionwill relapse after a single episode. The majority of these will relapse within 6 months andthe risk of relapse increases for each successive episode of depression. GPs see a largelyundifferentiated case-mix of patients and; once patients with depression reach remission;there is limited guidance and no validated tools to help GPs stratify patients according torisk of relapse.This study will potentially derive a statistical model to predict relapse ofdepression in remitted depressed patients in primary care.The investigators have created a longitudinal cohort of patients drawn from seven randomisedcontrolled trials (RCTs) of non-pharmacological primary care-based interventions fordepression and one longitudinal cohort study. The investigators will use logistic regressionto predict the outcome of relapse of depression within 6-8 months. The investigators plan toinclude the following well-evidenced relapse predictors in the model: residual depressivesymptoms; number of previous episodes of depression; co-morbid anxiety; and severity of theindex episode. They will also control for RCT intervention received by participants.If sample size and availability of predictor information allows; the investigators willinclude the following predictors in an exploratory analysis: age; relationship status;multi-morbidity; employment status; gender; and ethnicity.

Other authors documented significantlylonger postoperative hospital stay; greater health costs and a significant increase ofpostoperative complication and mortality rates when surgery is delayed in high-risk patientswith comorbidities or age > 65 years. Azuhata described a highly significant relationshipbetween delayed surgery and patients' survival: after 6 hours from admission to ED; patientswith gastrointestinal perforation and associated septic shock don't survive to surgery. Theaim of this study is to assess the impact of delay of time between patient admission to EDand surgery for source control on 30-d mortality and postoperative outcomes in patients withgastrointestinal perforation with or without septic shock. Furthermore; we want to define thetime threshold within which surgery can affect patients' survival.; This is an Italian National multicenter study composed by a retrospective phase of datacollection from patients of past ten years and a perspective one of next two years.INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA We include in our analysis all patients with more than 18years old undergoing emergency surgery for gastro-intestinal perforations; with or withoutsigns of septic shock.

NCT04874064,Triple Negative Breast Cancer Markers in Liquid Biopsies Using Artificial Intelligence (TRICIA Study); TRIple Negative Breast Cancer Markers In Liquid Biopsies Using Artificial Intelligence,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Develop signatures of good and poor outcome as well of tumor response to chemotherapy in TNBCs by integrating multidimensional profiling of both tumor and liquid biopsies making use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools; <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive of breast cancers and it isusually treated with chemotherapy even before surgery. In many cases; the chemotherapycompletely melts the tumor and these patients do well. When the tumor is not eliminated bythe chemotherapy; the patient receive more chemotherapy after surgery to decrease the chancesof it coming back. Yet many of these patients don't need that extra chemotherapy and will dowell in any case. One of the most exciting recent developments in cancer is the use ofliquid biopsies. It turns out that the tumor's DNA; RNA and proteins can be detected insmall vesicles found in the patient's blood. Thanks to advances in Artificial Intelligence;there is now informatics tools to integrate many types of molecular information. Ourindustrial partner; MIMs; will apply novel informatics tools to generate a test using all themolecular information obtained from blood vesicles and tissue that will be able to find outearly if tumor has spread outside of the breast; and how much tumor is left after surgery.The goal is hope to develop a multi-dimensional test for TNBC patients that can be used todecide how much treatment they need and if treatment given after surgery is working.; Rationale: The most aggressive form of breast cancer is triple negative breast cancer (TNBC);so called because these tumors do not express hormone receptors or HER2 receptor; andtherefore have no readily targetable molecules. Chemotherapy is the only treatment; withchemoresistance signaling a very poor outcome even in early TNBC. The presence of residualtumor at surgery (non-pathological complete response or non-pCR) signals chemoresistance andpoor prognosis; with about 30-40% of these patients dying of TNBC within the first 5 yearsafter surgery. A recent clinical trial showed that the addition of further chemotherapy(Capecitabine) results in improved survival in these patients with non-pCR; although onlyabout 15% of such patients do benefit. One of the most urgent unmet needs is to identifypatients who will do well despite non-pCR (so as to avoid extra chemotherapy) and who will dopoorly despite it; and also to identify factors of poor prognosis that may lead to noveltherapeutic strategies in this group.Current state of advancement of the technology: Until now; no biomarker except BRCA1/2mutations has demonstrated clinical utility in the treatment of TNBC; likely due to thecomplex biology and heterogeneity of the disease. With the recent advances in ArtificialIntelligence methodology; combining and integrating several layers of molecular data topredict outcome; until now challenging; becomes a reality. The hypothesize is that combiningmulti-dimensional data of tumor and plasma EVs can facilitate the development of prognosticand predictive signatures in this very aggressive disease.Preliminary data: Thanks to our Q-CROC-03 biopsy driven clinical trial where tumor and plasmafrom patients with TNBC resistant to chemotherapy were collected. Whole exome seq data weretranslated to generate personalized circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays. Our data shows apotential prognostic value to the detection of ctDNA after pre-operative chemotherapy. Thereis a collaboration established with Rodney Ouellette (ACRI) to isolate and profileextracellular vesicles (EVs) from plasma.Objectives: The objective of the present study is to develop signatures of good and pooroutcome as well of tumor response to chemotherapy in TNBCs by integrating multidimensionalprofiling of both tumor and liquid biopsies making use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools.Experimental approach: EVs profiling from plasma collected in the Q-CROC-03 trial and the JGHbiobank (prior; during and after chemotherapy treatment) will be performed. Profiling willinclude Whole Genome Sequencing (GWS); proteomics; transcriptomics and miRNA analysis. Incollaboration with our industrial partner; My Intelligent Machines (MIMs); experts inbioinformatics and AI; machine-learning algorithms will be developed to integrate OMICs datafrom resistant tumors with matched plasma EVs data and generate a tumor/plasma signatureassociated with poor outcome. In parallel; in collaboration with the EXACTIS InnovationNetwork; patients recruitment; collection of residual tumors post chemotherapy and matchedserial plasma samples during capecitabine treatment after surgery to perform the validationof the signature identified; the tumor/EV signature will be associated with patient survival.Milestones of the proposed project: 1. Profiling of EVs from plasma. 2. Profiling ofchemoresistant tumors 3. Development of algorithms to integrate multidimensional data fromtumor and EVs.The developed signatures will be IP protected.

Recognition of the impact of PMPS on function and mood and quality oflife in cancer survivors; and identification of risk factors would help physicians instituteappropriate pre-operative counselling and preventive measures to reduce the development ofPMPS. The investigators aim to follow up on the long-term multi-dimensional effects of PMPS;and continue to develop and validate a risk prediction model for patients at risk of PMPS inthe next phase of the study.; Post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) has been reported to occur in 25-60% of patientsfollowing surgeries for breast cancer; the highest occurring cancer in women worldwide. Thereis a lack of an accepted standard definition of PMPS which has resulted in the wide range ofestimates of its occurrence. While there has been much research interest in this condition;there is still a paucity of standardized and effective treatment at this point; and ourunderstanding of this condition; its exact incidence and risk factors; is still incomplete.The local incidence of PMPS after breast cancer surgery is presently unknown and oftenunder-reported; although breast cancer surgery is common and is carried out in almost allSinghealth institutions. Risk factors for PMPS in the local context may differ from thatpostulated in the West due to cultural; racial and societal differences. Breast cancer has ahigh survival rate; with data from the CONCORD-2 study showing a 5-year survival rate ofâ‰¥85%in developed countries. Despite high survival rates in cancer survivors; PMPS has beenshown to have a negative impact on the quality of recovery(QoR); patient satisfaction; andcan be severe enough causing the diminished quality of life (QoL) including poor sleep;long-term disability; mood disorders and interference with activities of daily living (ADL).Despite widespread recognition of PMPS; it is often untreated or undertreated. Some possiblereasons suggested for inadequate management of PMPS are the lack of quality information aboutoptimal treatment; and incomplete understanding of the mechanisms and risk factors forchronic pain development and prognosis. There is therefore a knowledge gap in theunderstanding of risk factors leading to PMPS; the lack of a validated risk prediction modelfor development of PMPS; and hence limiting the institution of preventive analgesia in highrisk patients. It is therefore timely to conduct a local multi-centre; prospective study tolook at the local incidence of PMPS after breast surgery; the multi-dimensional effects ofPMPS on the patient as well as to identify modifiable biopsychosocial risk factors leading toPMPS.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Not yet recruiting,NA,2021-07-07,2021-08-04,2021-07-25,Observational,NA,NA,Syndrome|Somatoform Disorders,NA,Precise estimate of the local incidence and clinical/functional impact of PMPS; Hypothesized to result from damage to major peripheral nerves during surgery.

Earlywarning scores (EWS) serve as a method to identify patients requiring RRT assessment byanalyzing routinely collected data such as vital signs and laboratory results. The VisensiaSafety Index (VSI) is an EWS that uses continuous vital sign monitoring and machine learningto identify the likelihood of deterioration and can be integrated with existing hospital datainfrastructure. Initial studies of the VSI have both validated the system and found thatpatients monitored using VSI had a shorter duration of any instability and fewer episodes ofserious and persistent instability. The investigators' recent retrospective analysis at TheOttawa Hospital (TOH) identified that implementation of an EWS could have detected earlierdeterioration in over half of the patients identified; potentially preventing subsequent ICUadmission; severity of illness; and/or mortality.

The criterion will be the difference between the first post-transplant FEV1 and the best FEV1 obtained during the year under consideration.<br><br>SUMMARY:Lung transplantation is the curative treatment for end-stage respiratory failure involvinghighly selected patients. In 2018; the International Transplant Registry counts 69200 lungtransplants among 260 transplant centers. Between 2010 and June 2017; the 3-month survivalrate of patients after lung transplantation is 90%. The causes of early death are primarygraft failure; renal failure; infections; acute rejection (cellular or humoral); surgicalcomplications. The median survival is 6.7 years and the median conditioned survival at 1 yearis 8.9 years. Bronchiolitis obliterans is the leading cause of death after 1 year; it affects10% more patients each year and peaks at 5 years at more than 50% of transplanted patients.These results encourage transplant professionals to continue their efforts to improve theprognosis of transplantation. Among these; the optimization of graft matching; taking intoaccount the characteristics of the donor and the recipient; constitute a relevant avenue ofstudy. Several donor characteristics seem to play a role in the prognosis of the transplant.Survival at 12 months is significantly worse when the donor's age is greater than 50 years.There does not appear to be a significant difference in donor cause of death. Recipients of agraft exposed to smoking â‰¥ 20 pack-years have a 3% and 1.5% decreased survival at 1 and 5years postoperatively.Similarly; the 5-year survival of patients with conditional 1-year survival is poorer in caseof other toxic exposures such as alcohol; cocaine; crack or marijuana. Analysis ofinternational registry data also suggests a negative association between post-transplantsurvival and donor hypertension and diabetes. However; the biological mechanisms by whichthese factors affect survival remain unknown. Graft ischemia time is significantly associatedwith survival with a 5-year survival of 70% and 65% for grafts exposed to ischemia â‰¥ 4 hoursor less. The cumulative effect of donor hypertension and ischemia time are appreciated by thefact that the best postoperative survival is observed in donors without hypertension andgraft ischemia time â‰¥ 4 hours. Graft size is also associated with post-transplant prognosis;in front of a significant decrease in survival for patients with emphysema; chronicobstructive pulmonary disease; alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; transplanted with a smallergraft size.This result is not found in patients transplanted for pulmonary fibrosis. One study has alsosuggested the negative role of a gender mismatch between donor and recipient onpost-transplant survival; but there is currently no clear explanation for this result. Thepresence of antibodies to the recipient's HLA system [DSA (donor-specific antibodies)] inpre-transplant is a risk factor for hyperacute rejection and chronic graft dysfunction. Thus;the choice of matching between the donor and the recipient appears complex in view of thenumber of criteria to be taken into account which impact the duration of post-transplantsurvival in the short and medium term. The objective of the project is to develop a decisionsupport tool; using artificial intelligence algorithms; to assist the thoracic surgeon inidentifying the patient; among those registered on the team's waiting list; who could benefitmost from a bi-pulmonary graft offered by the Biomedicine Agency.; ,TRUE,prognostic,development,Not yet recruiting,NA,2021-12-31,2022-01-19,2022-01-18,Observational,NA,NA,NA,NA,Construction of a tool to predict 90-day survival of patients managed for bi-pulmonary transplantation; This outcome corresponds to the number of all-cause deaths within 90 days of transplantation.

Thegreatest current limitation in the management of this type of lesion is the use ofantithrombotic medication (double antiaggregation) in the acute phase that is required incase of placing extracranial stent to stabilize the atheroma plaque. In relation to thisantiplatelet regimen; the latest clinical practice guidelines warn about the risk ofcombining intravenous fibrinolysis with antiplatelet medication in the acute phase; since itseems to increase the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). However; thenon-stabilization of the carotid atheroma plaque is associated with higher rates of cervicalreocclusion; poorer functional prognosis; and higher mortality.Therefore; the use of a single antiplatelet agent could be a reasonable alternative. Toestablish the best protocol for mono-antiaggregant therapy in the acute phase of TL; theinvestigators propose to carry out a prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial.1. All patients with ischemic stroke secondary to TL in the anterior circulation candidatesfor mechanical thrombectomy in whom cervical endoprosthesis will be placed in the acutephase; will be included; randomized to two groups: 500 mg of intravenous (iv) Aspirin vsLow dose regimen of Tirofiban iv.2. Carotid reocclusion rates and sICH rates will be evaluated within the first 24 hoursafter mechanical thrombectomy . As a secondary objective; the functional prognosis at 3months in both groups will be analyzed; as well as a panel of biomarkers predictors ofreocclusion in both groups.

NCT00005421,; Blood Pressure Tracking--Childhood to Young Adulthood,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:To extend analyses of blood pressure (BP) tracking to a period that spanned childhood andyoung adulthood. Data were used from the same cohort of 339 children who had been followedfor nine to twelve years in a previous study.; <br><br>BACKGROUND:Blood pressure measurements in childhood and young adulthood are less predictive of futurelevels than those taken in middle age. In part; this may be due to the fact thatwithin-person variability appears to make up a larger proportion of total variability inchildhood than adulthood. Previous work on an NHLBI supported grant indicated that repeatedblood pressure measurements and visits led to higher childhood tracking correlations over aperiod of three years.<br><br>DESIGN NARRATIVE:Follow-up data were used as well as multiple visits which reduced the large within-personvariability of blood pressure measurements and improved the tracking correlations. Inaddition; 'true' or 'corrected' tracking correlations were provided by eliminating theeffects of random measurement error. The effects were examined of time-varying covariates onboth the observed and true tracking correlations. Besides computing tracking correlations;predictive values were computed for young adult blood pressure given childhood levels. Thiswas the probability that a young adult's true blood pressure was above a specific cutpointconditional on childhood blood pressure. These values were validated using data from the FelsLongitudinal Study; which included serial blood pressure measurements over the age range inthe study. The prediction models were also derived including terms for covariates such asage; sex; height and weight. From these models nomograms were constructed which were usefulto physicians for prognostic purposes. Thus; because of the unique multiple-visit approachused in these data; the effect of random measurement error was eliminated. These methodologicimprovements strengthened the usefulness of blood pressure screening in childhood to detectthose at high risk of developing hypertension.The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the End Date entered inthe Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2000-05-25,2000-05-26,2016-03-15,Observational,NA,NA,Cardiovascular Diseases|Heart Diseases,NA,; ,; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,26,5,2000,blah,1234,1234,1234

NCT01325883,The Effect of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy on Exercise Capacity and Outcome Following Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Surgery.; The Effect of Chemotherapy and Surgery for Cancer on Exercise Capacity,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:The relative decrease in exercise capacity (LT) associated with NAC prior to upper gastrointestinal cancer resection will predict outcome (1 year mortality) following surgery.; <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Patients whose LT changes following NAC so that they move into a higher risk category will have a worse outcome (1 year mortality) when compared with those who do not increase risk category.; <br><br>SUMMARY:Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) prior to surgery for upper gastrointestinal (oesophageal andgastric) cancer is associated with improved survival. The investigators propose a prospectiveblinded observational cohort study of patients undergoing NAC prior to elective uppergastrointestinal cancer resection (oesophagectomy and gastrectomy) in three NHS teachinghospitals. The investigators have pilot data showing that NAC reduces objectively measuredexercise capacity (fitness). The literature suggests that a lower level of exercise capacityis associated with a high risk of adverse outcome (death and serious complications) aftermajor surgery.The investigators wish to explore the hypothesis that decrease in exercise capacity (fitness)associated with (NAC) prior to upper gastrointestinal cancer resection may outweigh thebenefits (duration of survival) achieved by NAC in some patients undergoing uppergastrointestinal cancer surgery. The investigators aim to recruit 175 patients from over 36months. Consenting patients will perform cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and completea quality of life questionnaire prior to and 4 weeks after NAC . Postoperative outcomesmeasured at set time points will be objective recorded including mortality 1 year aftersurgery and short term postoperative harm described by the PostOperative Morbidity Survey(POMS) as well as Quality of life scores and resource use (e.g. hospital bed utilisation).Exercise capacity (fitness) before and after NAC will be assessed using CPET and therelationship between the derived variables (AT; VO2 peak) and clinical outcomes will bedescribed.; STUDY SUMMARYThe investigators propose a prospective blinded observational cohort study of patientsundergoing NAC prior to elective upper gastrointestinal cancer resection (oesophagectomy andgastrectomy) in three NHS teaching hospitals. Exercise capacity (fitness) before and afterNAC will be assessed using CPET and the relationship between the derived variables (AT; VO2peak) and clinical outcomes will be described. Postoperative outcomes will be objectiverecorded clinically meaningful and will include mortality 1 year after surgery and short termpostoperative harm described by the PostOperative Morbidity Survey (POMS) Quality of liferusing the EQ5D questionnaire and resource use (e.g. hospital bed utilization). The hypotheseswill be tested by constructing predictive models incorporating exercise variables and factorsknown to be related to outcome following surgery (e.g. age; gender; open versus laparoscopicsurgery). For example; for the Primary Hypothesis; models will be developed to predict therisk of one year mortality using (i) baseline exercise capacity and (ii) baseline exercisecapacity and the relative decrease in exercise capacity. The aim will be to compare thepredictive ability of both models to ascertain how prognostic the relative decrease inexercise capacity is; after adjusting for baseline exercise. In addition; Hypothesis 1 willbe investigated by comparing AT before and after NAC using a paired t-test and Hypothesis 2will be investigated by comparing the risk of 1year mortality between patients who stay inthe same AT band and those who deteriorate using a chi squared test. Logistic regression willbe used to repeat the analysis adjusting for potential confounders.Study ConductThis study will be undertaken within Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust; AintreeUniversity Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; and University Hospitals; Bristol.

There is no simpler; or cheaper methodof reliably measuring exercise capacity (fitness) without using CPET. Both LT and VO2 Peakare known to be associated with outcome following major surgery.Justification of other CPET variables Other CPET derived variables will also be recorded inorder to explore the reasons for limitations in exercise capacity(fitness) in order to informon what types of interventions might be effective to mitigate these changes.Justification of risk measures O-POSSUM is a reliable and valid measure of perioperative riskwhich will provide a standard against which to compare the predictive performance of the CPETderived variables.JUSTIFICATION OF POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOME MEASURES Justification of primary and secondaryoutcome variables-MortalityThe primary outcome variable will be all cause mortality 1 year after date of surgery. Theinvestigators chose this variable for several reasons; including that it:-Is meaningful to patients; carers; administrators and policy makers.-Is readily verifiable; and therefore reliable.-Occurs with sufficient frequency to allow construction of a predictive model with asample size that can be collected within a manageable timeframe.Limitations of this variable are that the cause of death may not be directly related tochemotherapy or surgery but may arise due to disease progression or recurrence. However;all-cause mortality remains an important outcome to patients.-POMS In order to explore the relationship between NAC; surgery and short-term harm theinvestigators propose to monitor short-term postoperative harm using the PostOperativeMorbidity Survey (POMS). POMS is the only validated measure of short term postoperativeharm16 and has been used in outcomes research and effectiveness research. It is incurrent use as a primary outcome variable in MRC and NIHR funded studies.-Quality of Life (QoL) Measures using EQ5D The impact of NAC and surgery on patientquality of life will be assessed using A validated questionnaire. The investigators willassess subjective changes in patient's state using a a questionnaires. Thequestionnaires will be self-completed by the patient; taking about 15-20 minutes intotal. The questionnaires to be used will be EQ5D which has been recommended for use asa generic PROM following major surgery.-Resource Use In order to obtain a full picture of the clinical course and resource useof the study patients; additional outcome variables will include: Reoperation;Readmission to hospital; length of post-operative hospital stay; readmission tohospital; total postoperative hospital bed usage; length of postoperative critical carestay; readmission to critical care; total postoperative critical care bed usage.SAMPLE SIZE The hypotheses listed in (Aims of the Project) will be tested by constructingpredictive models incorporating exercise variables and factors known to be related to outcomefollowing surgery (e.g. age; gender; open versus laparascopic surgery). For the primaryhypothesis; models will be developed to predict the risk of one year mortality using (i)baseline exercise capacity and (ii) baseline exercise capacity and the relative decrease inexercise capacity.The aim will be to compare the predictive ability of both models to ascertain how prognosticthe relative decrease in exercise capacity is; after adjusting for baseline exercise. Todevelop reliable prediction models approximately 252 patients are required. This is using theRule of 10 and assumes that the one year mortality rate is 20% (conservative estimate) andthat models contain 5 factors (e.g. age; gender; centre; location of tumour; laparoscopicversus open).Given a 20% non-completion of NAC and 2 CPET tests (based on Liverpool data); this will beachievable since approximately 525 patients will attend the centres over the 25monthrecruitment period (based on average of last three years patient throughput; with ananticipated recruitment rate of 60%.Sample size for Hypothesis 1: A sample of 152 patients would be required to detect adifference in 1 [unit] of VO2@LT using a paired t-test at the 5% significance level with 90%power. This is assuming the standard deviation of the difference in VO2@LT values is 3.8[units].Sample size for hypothesis 2B: A sample size of 242 is required to detect a difference in oneyear mortality rates of 15% (30% versus 15%) between the two LT change groups (no change /deteriorate) using a chi squared test at the 5% significance level with 80% power. This isassuming that there are equal numbers of patients in both groups.ANALYSIS PLAN1. Relationship between exercise capacity changes and clinical outcome.2. Effect of chemo on exercise capacity and other CPET variables. Patients who do notcomplete NAC and 2 CPET tests will be eligible to enter the study and their datacollected. The sample size calculation and primary analysis will be of patients whocomplete CPET before and after NAC. Secondary analyses will include patients who wereunable to complete CPET before and after NAC; and will compare patients who underwentsurgery and those in whom surgery was subsequently canceled.Descriptive analyses (means and proportions) will be carried out to describe the patients'characteristics including baseline and changes in exercise capacity; and their clinicaloutcomes including 1year mortality; morbidity and PROMS.The calculation for hypothesis 1 is based on a comparison of fitness (using VO2@AT) beforeand after NAC. As this is a within-patient comparison the investigators use the pairedt-test. The standard deviation for the within-patient difference is assumed to be 3.8. Thiswas estimated from the pilot data in the Background and assumes a correlation of 0.5 betweenbefore and after values. The clinically important difference of 1 was considered conservativeand feasible since the pilot data had a difference of 2.1. The calculation for hypothesis 2Bis based on a dichotomisation of patients in two groups: a) those who deteriorate after NACb) those who don't. To compare mortality rates between the two groups the investigators woulduse a chi squared test(although a logrank test may be appropriate if dropout is an issue).It's assumed that the two groups will be approximately equal (this is discussed elsewhere)and that the mortality rates for the two groups are 30% and 15% respectively.The sample size calculation for hypothesis 2/2A is not based on power but instead is based onthe amount of data required to develop a robust and reliable risk model. The idea is todevelop a risk prediction model based on preNAC factors and quantify its predictive ability(e.g. using the ROC area). McCulloch (BMJ; 2003) does something similar. Next theinvestigators will add postNAC fitness to the model and establish whether this extra dataprovides extra predictive ability.The usual approach to calculating the sample size for a risk model is based on the rule of10; that is the investigators require 10 times as many (mortality) events as there arepredictors in the model. Our models will have 5 factors so the investigators require 50events. Assuming a mortality rate of 20% suggests that the investigators require 250 patientsin total. Note that this does not give us specific power to detect some predefined clinicaleffect (this would be a very difficult calculation since pre- and post-NAC fitness are likelyto be correlated) but rather gives us enough data to fit risk prediction models to quantifythe incremental benefit of post-NAC fitness.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2011-03-29,2011-03-30,2016-07-11,Observational,NA,NA,Esophageal Neoplasms,NA,The relative decrease in exercise capacity (LT) associated with NAC prior to upper gastrointestinal cancer resection will predict outcome (1 year mortality) following surgery.; ,Patients whose LT changes following NAC so that they move into a higher risk category will have a worse outcome (1 year mortality) when compared with those who do not increase risk category.; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,30,3,2011,blah,1234,1234,1234

Indeed these chemokines have shownanti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties in experimental models and may be particularlyinteresting for prognostic and predictive purposes.; Based on a physiopathological rationale; the use of RCC-directed antiangiogenic therapiesinto clinical practice leads to conclusive results and makes RCC a particularly well-suitedtumor type to study factors involved in the angiogenic process. Furthermore the intensive useof targeted therapies in clinical practice raised new questions about their management.Therefore the identification of new molecular biomarkers is important:-to improve the precision of prognostic models currently based on clinical; biological orhistopathological variables-to identify high risk patients that could benefit from an adjuvant treatment or a closerpostoperative follow-up-to predict the response to antiangiogenic therapies and therefore identify the drugwhich is likely to be the most effective within an ever increasing pharmacopeia-to follow the therapy as precisely as possible; predict or attest the diseaseprogression justifying a therapeutic modificationLow CXCL4; CXCL4L1 and CXCR3 tumor expression levels are associated with bad prognosisfactors in RCC.

In fact; it is notwell known either if it is sufficient to correct the variables called macrodynamics  suchas mean arterial pressure (MAP) ; stroke volume (SV); pulmonary artery occlusion pressure(PCWP) and cardiac index (CI) or if it is necessary to correct other micro-dynamicsvariables like lactate; to achieve a certain central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) orarteriovenous CO2 difference(Î”vapCO2).In tissue hypoxia; damping of excess protons by bicarbonate increase CO2 production;therefore the relationship between CO2 production and oxygen consumption (VCO2/VO2 ratio orrespiratory quotient) increases.

Patients' immunity modified by cancer cells is found to be correlatedto cancer progression and metastasis.Natural killer cells; playing an important role in cytotoxic immune system; are revealed tobe decreased in patients with lung cancer; ovarian cancer; prostate cancer; colorectalcancer; and breast cancer. And in melanoma mouse model; when NK cell was suppressed; cancerprogression and metastasis were accelerated.This study sought to find the correlation of patients' cytotoxic immune status to cancerprogression and status by measurement of NK cell activity in pancreatic cancer patients.

All current internationalguidelines recommend LT for HCC only within pre-defined criteria.The use of restrictive criteria to select patients affected by HCC for LT was originallyproposed with the Milan criteria. These criteria were based on pathologic assessment ofnumber and size of the HCC nodules on the explanted liver. Subsequently; many authorsproposed the expansion of such restrictive criteria (e.g. UCSF; Tumour Volume; Up-To-Sevenetc.). All these attempts; based on different combinations of morphologic parameters; havebeen defined on the pathologic staging of the tumor made on the removed liver; namely afterLT; once decision on treatment and treatment itself could not be changed.Over time; various attempts have also been made to correlate postoperative pathologicfindings of HCC to preoperative clinical staging in order to anticipate decision-making.Should a reliable conversion algorithm correlating pre-operative staging with post-transplantprognosis be available a selection of LT candidates based on routine radiologic HCC findingswould optimise survival patient survival and organ resource allocation.Although post-LT pathology / pre-LT radiology correlation have improved over time;significant biases still affect clinical assessment of HCC stage and no reliable protocolshas entered clinical practice yet. In addition; robust evidence indicates that otherbiological markers of aggressiveness (such as Î±-Fetoprotein levels and clinical response tobridge therapies) have to be added when evaluating pre-operative variables.Another important issue to be considered when dealing with LT for HCC is the strikingprogress in treating chronic viral infections (HCV and HBV) that has been achieved over thelast few years. Due to the possibility of treating recurrence of viral infections in thetransplanted liver; these conditions do not significantly affect mortality following LT asthey did in the past.In the current scenario; the decreasing role of non-oncologic factors in survival of patientstreated by LT for HCC enhances the need to define new prognostic models oriented towardscancer-specific survival. These models should include; besides conventional morphologicalparameters; also the response to bridge therapies delivered in the pre-transplant setting aswell as other biologic markers commonly used in clinical practise such as Î±-Fetoproteinlevels.Although many studies have been conducted; prognostic calculators of cancer-specific survivalfor HCC patients undergoing an evaluation for LT are not yet available. Such models should beable to provide survival estimates based on pre-treatment oncologic variables.A tailored assessment of cancer-specific prognosis is strongly advocated also by regulatoryauthorities; to optimize the allocation/distribution criteria of the limited source ofavailable organs. Therefore; these criteria could be useful in the daily practise oftransplant Centres to define different priority levels within the waiting list for LT; bothfor patients with and without HCC.Endpoints and clinical relevance: The main goal of the study is the definition of acancer-specific prognostic model based on pre-operative features (radiologic staging andÎ±-Fetoprotein levels) of a wide population of patients who underwent LT for HCC.Considering the competitive risk of cancer-specific mortality and death due to other causes;the investigators aim to redefine the Up-To-Seven criteria; as they were developed on thebase of pathologic staging.Primary endpoints: besides conventional outcome endpoints; the study aims to develop andvalidate a prognostic calculator of recurrence rate and cancer-specific survival for HCCpatients undergoing evaluation for LT.The prognostic algorithm will be based on the competitive risk analysis of cancer-relatedrecurrence and survival vs. non-cancer related outcome.Clinical relevance: the development of an on-line available prognostic calculator based onpre-operative oncologic factors would provide precise estimates of survival. This could helpin the comparison of patients with different disease stage and comorbidities; by definingprogressive priority levels to be applied to the waiting list for LT.The final goal is to provide reliable survival estimates for patients at different diseasestage and therefore with different priority.This perspective may have great clinical impact as would allow the definition of differentpriority levels for LT in HCC; both to provide a prognosis-oriented treatment for eachpatient and to optimise the global outcome of the population of patients eligible for LT.Observational period: Retrospective analysis of a population of patients who underwent LT forHCC from January 2000 to December 2015.Study population size: The expected number of patients from Italian centres is more than 1000cases.If the training set will allow the development of a cancer-specific prognostic model; atleast 300 other cases will have to be added as a further set of external validation;preferably belonging to an Eastern series (see above).,TRUE,prognostic,development; validation,Completed,NA,2016-09-08,2016-09-13,2017-09-01,Observational,NA,NA,Carcinoma; Hepatocellular|Recurrence,HCC|Liver Transplantation|AFP|Mortality|Competing risk|Selection criteria|Recurrence,Cancer specific survival; ,Overall Survival Recurrence Free Survival; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,13,9,2016,blah,1234,1234,1234

Our primary objective is to determine CCTA-based atherosclerotic plaquecharacteristics that would help elucidate precursors of incident ACS; with the secondaryobjective being an analysis of gender-specific disparities.; Acute myocardial infarctions resulting from unstable plaque in patients with coronary arterydisease (CAD) account for a significant portion of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Although prediction models that incorporate traditional risk factors have been developed inorder to risk stratify patients at highest risk for development of subsequent cardiovascularevents; such models lack precision and are often found to over or under-estimate risk.Moreover; current clinical practice has focused on stenosis severity as a predictor of futureplaque erosion and/or rupture; in spite of the fact that evidence from intravascularultrasound (IVUS) studies; such as the PROSPECT trial; demonstrate that ACS events are morelikely to occur in less than severely stenotic lesions. Furthermore; there is incompleteunderstanding of the influence of gender on atherosclerotic plaque composition and downstreamcoronary events; given the chronologic and prognostic differences between men and women inatherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.Several studies have attempted elucidating characteristics of vulnerable plaque usinginvasive imaging modalities such as IVUS. However; such studies have several limitations;most significantly is the fact that plaque characterization was performed after an acutecoronary event; which limits the ability to isolate baseline plaque characteristics fromchanges following the acute event. Noninvasive evaluation of atherosclerotic coronary diseaseusing coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) has been established as an accurateand readily available imaging modality in clinical practice. In addition to the evaluation ofdiameter stenosis; CCTA is capable of evaluation plaque composition as well as arterialremodeling; in a similar fashion to IVUS. The agreement between plaque characterization usingIVUS and CCTA has been demonstrated in several large-scale trials. Nevertheless; there areseveral key aspects that have yet to be addressed; including the utility of plaquecharacterization by CCTA for determination of future cardiovascular events; and gender-baseddifferences in atherosclerotic plaque composition in patients with stable and unstablecoronary artery disease.The ICONIC trial was designed as a nested case-control study based on the previouslypublished CONFIRM registry; evaluating demographic; clinical as well as baselineCCTA-determined plaque composition in 238 patients with subsequent ACS events and 238 matchedpatients without ACS events. As previously described; ICONIC utilizes CCTA to comprehensivelyassess plaque morphology and characteristics; in addition to arterial wall changes in orderto determine characteristics implicated in future adverse events; beyond what has beentraditionally described using invasive imaging modalities. The primary goal is to investigatedifferences in atherosclerotic plaque composition in patients with ACS; compared to patientswith stable coronary disease.

The investigators hypothesize that multiple premorbidand acute factors measured early in the course of CCI will have strong independentassociations with functional recovery. The investigators further hypothesize that social andeconomic factors are associated with long-term functional outcomes independent of the acuteclinical problems.; A substantial number of critically ill patients experience persistent organ failure leadingto chronic critical illness (CCI). The majority of these patients die within a year; and manysurvivors must cope with long-term physical and cognitive limitations that are often severe.Survival with severe physical and cognitive dysfunction is a significant clinical; emotional;and economic burden in this population; but little is known about which patients are athighest risk for physical and cognitive dysfunction. Moreover; although long-term mortalityin CCI can be reliably estimated with a validated mortality prediction model; there iscurrently no validated method to predict long-term functional disability for purposes ofshared decision-making and resource planning. In order to address these gaps in knowledge;the investigators will conduct a multi-center prospective cohort study that measures clinicaland premorbid risk factors for long-term physical and cognitive dysfunction in CCI. Usingthese risk factors; the investigators will construct a multi-outcome prognostic model forsurvival with severe physical or cognitive dysfunction to facilitate shared decision-makingand resource planning. Additionally; the investigators will identify independent social andeconomic variables that are risk factors for long-term survival and functional disability.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2017-05-16,2017-05-18,2021-10-20,Observational,NA,NA,Critical Illness,Prognosis|Critical Illness|Ventilation; Mechanical|Disease Attributes|Socioeconomic Factors|Activities of Daily LIving|Cognition,Proportion of Patients who Survive with Severe Physical Disability.

Mortalityrates of cardiac arrest range from 60-85%; and approximately 80% of survivors are initiallycomatose. Of those who survive; 50% are left with a permanent neurological disability; andonly 10% are able to resume their former lifestyle. Early prognosis of comatose patientsafter cardiac arrest is critical for management of these patients; yet predicting outcome forthese patients remains quite challenging.The primary study objective of MOCHA is to develop an accurate and reliable assessmentalgorithm for determining neurologic prognosis in patients initially unconscious (no eyeopening; GCS-M<6 and not following commands) post-cardiac arrest; using multiple prognosticmodalities at standardized time points.; The investigators will conduct a prospective; international; observational study of cardiacarrest survivors using guideline-recommended prognostic assessment tools with centraladjudication of results; while avoiding premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy(WLST).

For patients; a first MRI and a second MRI will be performed after 2 years (+/- 2 months) in order to evaluate prospectively the progression of aortic dilatation according to stiffness parameters.<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Comparison of aortic stiffness evaluation with different methods TTE; MRI; UF; Comparison of aortic stiffness evaluation with different methods TTE; MRI; UF<br><br>SUMMARY:The objective is the development and validation of morphological markers informative ofaortic dilatation in order to improve the precision of the risk of aneurysm of the thoracicaorta and of acute aortic syndrome for patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV).The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a correlation between the aortic localpulse wave velocity (PWV) measured with MRI and the progression of the thoracic aortadiameters measured by MRI after a follow-up of 2 years.; Background Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect withprevalence around 1 to 2% of the general population . It is defined by the presence of twofunctional cusps with less than three parallel zones of apposition between the cusps. Thisdifferent valve's morphology is associated with a spectrum of valvular (aortic stenosis andinsufficiency) and aortic complications (aneurysm and dissection). Indeed; the valvularabnormality is associated with changes in the aortic arch with an increase in the incidenceof ascending aortic aneurysm unrelated to valvular functional impairment. The mechanismsresponsible for aortic involvement are still incompletely understood but combine; in varyingproportions; a constitutional fragility (linked to a common embryological origin of theaortic valve and the aortic arch) and to the haemodynamic modifications; generated by thespecific morphology of BAV .Current risk prediction of aneurysm development is currently performed only with theascending aortic diameter; associated with history of aortic coarctation and familial historyof dissection. Moreover; aortic dilatation may occur after aortic valve replacement alone;necessitating a second intervention; with a higher surgical risk. Improvement of theaortopathy evaluation is therefore a major stake in the evaluation of the BAV patient.Studies of the biomechanical properties of the BAV aortic wall converge towards an increasein arterial stiffness as well as in other elastopathies such as Marfan's disease. Thus;measurements of aortic distensibility in trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) or MRI; or themeasurement of the Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) are significantly different case of BAV comparedto the general population. However; no prospective study has demonstrated the prognostic roleof these morphological biomarkers in the prediction of aortic dilation.From a biomechanical point of view; the vessel's rupture appears when the mechanical stressapplied to the wall exceeds the material resistance properties. The aortic resistanceevaluation requires the use of different imaging modalities which propose the measurement ofstiffness parameters. Circumferential stiffness (with TTE or MRI) can be evaluated bymeasuring the distensibility. In addition; longitudinal stiffness can be evaluated bymeasuring the local PWV.We aim at better defining the vascular involvement of BAV patients by determining theprognostic role of functional parameters as non-invasive predictive factors for aorticdilation.Hypothesis:1.Main hypothesis The main hypothesis is that the progression of aortic dilation is dependenton the longitudinal and circumferential aortic stiffness in case of BAV.The investigators will therefore try to demonstrate a correlation between the local PWVmeasurements in MRI; combined with a simultaneous measurement of the non-invasive centralpressure (SphygmoCor XCELÂ®; Atcor Medical Â©); with the segmental aortic size progression. Theinvestigators hope to define new biomarkers aortic dilation prediction.1.Secondary hypothesis-The measurement of the local PWV of the common carotid artery; measured with UF; iscorrelated with the progression of the aortic dilation.-The measurement of aortic distensibility at the Valsalva sinus and ascending tubularaortic levels; measured in TTE or MRI; correlates with the progression of aorticdilation.Originality and innovative aspects - Prospective evaluation of the different aortic segmentsdilatation in case of <br><br>BAV: Few studies have prospectively evaluated the aortic dilationprogression in BAV. There are currently no prognostic markers of dilatation validated in thisgroup.- Use of aortic MRI combined with central pressure measurement as a prognostic evaluationtool for aortopathy associated with <br><br>BAV: Following the development of 4D MRI incardiovascular imaging; evaluation of the aorta is possible by studying both the wall'smovements during the cardiac cycle and the wall shear stress evaluation. This makes possibleto obtain; at each part of the thoracic aorta; measures of circumferential distensibility;local PWV; and shear stress.Coupling these two imaging modalities is particularly interesting in the aortic evaluation ofBAV due to the involvement of the flow changes in aortic stiffness.- Use of the common carotid artery stiffness as a prognostic evaluation tool for aortopathyassociated with BAV independently of the aortic diameter Due to the common embryologicalorigin of aorta and the common carotid arteries; aortopathy associated with BAV is associatedwith an increase in of the common carotid arteries stiffness.The evaluation of the carotid artery will therefore help to evaluate the correlation betweencarotid rigidity and progression of aortic dilation.- Evaluation of the local PWV as carotid stiffness biomarker Ultrasound analysis will also beinnovative; with the use of a fine ultrasonic method with very high frame rate (more than10;000 images per second) developed by the Langevin Institute (Mathias Fink; Michael Tanterand Mathieu Pernot). The collaboration between the Langevin Institute and the H.E.G. lead tonumerous publications both in the vascular and cardiac levels. The vascular medicinedepartment has an AixplorerÂ® prototype with vascular and cardiac applications on site. Theadvantage of this technology is its ultrafastecho mode with very high temporal resolutionwhich allows the vascular level to visualize and to calculate the speed of the arterial pulsewave which is correlated to the local rigidity.The use of this innovative technique in aortic bicuspid will hopefully validate theevaluation of the carotid velocity of the pulse wave as an easily accessible prognosticmarker of aortic dilation.Purpose of the researchThe objective is the development and validation of morphological markers informative ofaortic dilatation in order to improve the precision of the risk of aneurysm of the thoracicaorta and of acute aortic syndrome for patients with BAV.The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a correlation between the aortic localPWV measured with MRI and the progression of the thoracic aorta diameters measured by MRIafter a follow-up of 2 yearsThe secondary objectives are:1.

The overall in-hospital survival rate widely varies bothworldwide and across communities; from 1 to 4 folds according to circumstances of arrest andpost-resuscitation interventions. Several studies have already shown that early interventionsperformed after ROSC; such as treatment of the cause; targeted temperature management;optimal hemodynamic management and extra-corporeal life support in selected patients; couldimprove the outcome in post-cardiac arrest patients. However; the decision process regardingthe allocation of these resources; in parallel with the management of patients' proxies;remains a complex challenge for physicians facing these situations. Consequently; severalprediction models and scores have been developed in order to stratify the risk of unfavorableoutcome and to discriminate the best candidates for post-resuscitation interventions.Overall; several scores exist; but external validation are lacking and direct comparisons areneeded to assess relative interest of scoring systems.

Study ofMDS has been rapidly transformed by genome characterization.The investigators hypothesize that comprehensive analyses of large patient population willallow to correctly estimate the effect of each mutation on clinical outcomes; and that nichefactors and immune dysfunctions may influence the development of MDS; clonal evolution andresponse to treatmentsAims1- Investigate gene mutations; niche factors and immune dysfunctions influencing thedevelopment of MDS; and define biomarkers for early identification of individuals at risk; 2-Develop prognostic models for MDS patients through integration of comprehensivegenomic/clinical information; 3- Define biomarkers to better stratify the individualprobability of response to specific treatmentsMethods EuroBloodNet; the European Reference Network in rare hematological diseases; willprovide a basis for research activities. Study of genomic features of clonal dominance inelderly subjects enrolled in large population-based studies and description of the dynamicsof clonal establishment and evolution; study of bone marrow microenvironment to identifyimmune dysfunctions influencing MDS development. Development of inclusive statistical modelsto accurately predict clinical outcome at individual level; based on large MDS populationswith comprehensive genomic/clinical data. Finally; analysis of mutational screening andimmune profiles from patients enrolled in prospective trials; to provide evidence ongenetic/immunologic profiles associated with probability of response to specific compoundsExpected results To characterize how clonal hematopoiesis relates to the induction of MDSclinical phenotype; and to test the utility of gene sequencing to detect subjects at risk ofdeveloping MDS. To define effective prognostic systems and biomarkers to stratify theindividual probability of response to treatment; MDS typically occurs in elderly people and a portion of these subjects evolve into acutemyeloid leukemia (AML). The natural history of MDS is highly heterogeneous; and therefore arisk-adapted treatment strategy is mandatory.The presence of mutations in a given individual has only limited predictive power; asconversion to MDS is rare regardless of mutation status. In addition; in patients with overtMDS; genetic abnormalities explain only a proportion of the total hazard for survival;meaning that a large percentage is still associated with clinical and non-mutational factors.Comprehensive analyses of large patient populations are warranted to correctly estimate theindependent effect of each mutation on clinical outcome and response to treatment.Moreover; environmental factors influencing the development of MDS and the probability ofresponse to specific treatments are to be characterized. They include alterations in theimmune system. In this context; a significant association was found between autoimmunedisorders and MDS; and activation of the inflammasome may contribute to MDS developmentAIMS 1- Investigate gene mutations; niche factors and immune dysfunctions influencing thedevelopment of MDS; and define biomarkers for early identification of individuals at risk; 2-Develop prognostic models for MDS patients through integration of comprehensivegenomic/clinical information; 3- Define biomarkers to better stratify the individualprobability of response to specific treatmentsEXPERIMENTAL DESIGNAIM11a) The investigators will analyze the genomic features of clonal dominance and ineffectivehematopoiesis in elderly subjects enrolled in different population-based studies.Peripheral blood samples will be available for biological investigations. A low-cost;high-throughput platform for mutation screening of 72 genes known to be relevant in MDS willbe used.1b) In order to gain further insight into the MDS genetic heterogeneity; the investigatorswill perform DNA sequencing in hematopoietic progenitors single cells to clarify the clonalarchitecture of marrow dysplasia in HSC; the dynamics of clonal establishment and expansionduring hematopoietic differentiation; and their relationship with the disease phenotype andevolution1c) In selected elderly individuals; the investigators will study the transcriptome (RNAsequencing) of isolated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and marrow microenvironment (i.e.;innate ad adaptive immunity) with the aim to identify niche factors that may influence thedevelopment of a MDS phenotype in elderly subjects with clonal hematopoiesis. Moreover; inpatients suffering from both MDS and autoimmune disorder; the investigators will analyzeimmunological parameters. They will be compared with those of patients with MDS but withoutimmune disorder; and patients with immune disorders without MDSAIM2In myeloid malignancies; it was shown that large knowledge banks of matched genomic-clinicaldata can improve clinical decision-making.In the present project; basing on large MDS populations with comprehensive genomic andclinical data available within EuroBloodNet network (data on >3000 patients will beavailable); the investigators will develop inclusive; multistage statistical models (Bayesiannetwork analysis and clustering) to accurately predict clinical outcomes in MDS atindividual-patient level. The investigators plan to define 2 homogenous clinical cohorts inorder to define distinct patterns and genetic groups within MDS and to independently validatetheir predictive value. As a research tool; the investigators plan to create a prototypeportal within our EuroBloodNet website that allows outcome predictions to be generated basedon this data set for user-defined constellations of genomic features and clinical variables.The reliability of this tool on clinical decision making will be tested in a prospectiveobservational trial in the context of EuroBloodNetAIM3The investigators will analyze the mutational status and immune landscape associated withresponse to HMA in MDS patients enrolled in prospective clinical trials conducted within theEuroBloodNet network. Patients treated with azacitidine from prospective studies will beavailable for biological investigations to define biomarkers associated with clinicalresponse. Validation of biomarkers will then be performed in an independent cohort. In allthese studies; biobanking of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples has beensystematically performed; providing a unique resource to be investigated within thisproposal. Data on mutational screening and immune profiles are already available in mostpatients; and were obtained by comparable methods. For mutation screening; a NGS approachcovering key genes involved in myeloid malignancies and the response to HMA was used. For acomprehensive immunological characterization of T lymphocytes; NK cells and ILC cells;standardized flow cytometric protocols were used; which will provide novel insights intofrequency; differentiation and activity of these cells in response to therapy.

Leiden CTA score is calculated using the following approach. First; the presence of CAD is determined in each segment. When plaque is absent the score is 0. When plaque is present a score of 1.1; 1.2 or 1.3 is given according to plaque composition (calcified; noncalcified; and mixed plaque; respectively). Subsequently; this score is multiplied by a weight factor for the location of the segment in the coronary artery tree (0.5 through 6 according to vessel; proximal location and system dominance) and multiplied by a weight factor for stenosis severity (1.4 for â‰¥50% stenosis and 1.0 for stenosis <50%). The final score (range 0 to 42) is calculated by addition of the individual segment scores. The relative severity of a lesion is indicated using a score of 1 for 1-25% obstruction and doubling that number as the severity of obstruction progresses with each step in the 25-50-75-90-99-100% diameter reduction. Thus; the severity score for each lesion may range from 1 to 32. Furthermore; the score weighed according to the usual blood flow to the left ventricle in each vessel or vessel segment. A multiplying factor is applied to each lesion score based upon its location in the coronary tree; depending on the functional significance of the area supplied by that segment. If a segment is totally occluded or 99% stenosed and receiving collaterals; a collateral adjustment factor is used; and the adjustment is reduced by the extent of disease in the vessel that is the source of collaterals. The final score is the sum of all the lesion scores. CCTA-derived SYNTAX score (CT-SYNTAX score) is a lesion-based grading tool to characterise the coronary vasculature with respect to the number of lesions and their functional impact; location; and complexity. Higher SYNTAX scores; indicative of more complex disease; are hypothesized to represent a bigger therapeutic challenge and to have potentially worse prognosis. Frequency (%) of occurrence of high-risk plaque features (HU < 30; Remodelling Index > 1.1; napkin-ring sign & spotty calcium) Patients are assigned a risk score between 0-100 based on former patient prognosis data. The score is an extension of the 3-vessel disease score. It also incorporates stenosis severity and calculates with left main stenosis and proximal left anterior descending stenosis.

Data from computational fluid dynamics studies have confirmed thisfinding by demonstrating that even in the absence of alterations in the amount of branchflow; a wide angle between the side branches intensifies flow perturbations; increases thespatial endothelial shear stress (ESS) variations in the bifurcation region and the low ESSin the lateral walls; thereby augmenting the atherosclerosis-prone environment.

Current treatments for chronic MSK pain are suboptimal and have been tied to theopioid crisis. Only ~50% of adolescents with chronic MSK pain who present formultidisciplinary pain treatment recover; as measured by clinical endpoints of pain severityand functional disability. Discovery of robust markers of the recovery vs. persistence ofpain and disability is essential to develop more resourceful and patient-specific treatmentstrategies and to conceive novel approaches that benefit patients who are refractory. Giventhat chronic pain is a biopsychosocial process; the discovery and validation of a prognosticand robust signature for pain recovery vs. persistence requires measurements across multipledimensions in the same patient cohort in combination with a suitable 'big data' computationalanalysis pipeline for the extraction of reliable and cross-validated results from amultilayered and complex dataset. The research team is well positioned to execute the studyaims with: (1) A highly skilled and experienced team of scientists and clinicians fromStanford University; University of Toronto/Hospital for Sick Children; and CincinnatiChildren's Hospital Medical Center; (2) A standardized specimen collection; processing;storage; and distribution system; leveraging Stanford Biobank's platform; BioCatalyst; toaggregate the sample inventory with clinical annotations for an accessible; virtual biobank;within the Signature of Pain Recovery IN Teens (SPRINT) Biobank and Analysis Core (SBAC); (3)Cutting-edge preliminary data implicating novel candidates for neuroimaging; immune;quantitative sensory; and psychological markers for discovery; and (4) Expertise in machinelearning approaches to extract reliable and prognostic bio-signatures from a large andcomplex data set. The research team expects that the results from this project willfacilitate risk stratification in patients with chronic MSK; a more resourceful selection ofpatients who are likely to respond for undergoing current multidisciplinary pain treatmentapproaches; and new insight into biological and behavioral processes that may be exploited todevelop novel strategies profiting those who are refractory.For the R61/Discovery Phase Aim individuals will be thoroughly characterized via biological(i.e. brain structure and function; immune; sensory profiles); psychological state; andclinical endpoint (i.e.; pain intensity; disability) data. Unbiased machine learningalgorithms will identify a multivariate model comprised of the most prognostic biological;psychological; and clinical endpoints. The model will classify adolescents with and withoutresolving chronic MSK pain after a state-of-the art multidisciplinary pain treatmentintervention.

CC-1 binds tohuman prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on tumor cells of squamous cell carcinoma ofthe lung (SCC) as well as to tumor vessels of SCC; thereby allowing for a dual mode ofanti-cancer action. CC-1 was developed in a novel format which not only prolongs serumhalf-life but most importantly reduces off-target T cell activation with expected fewer sideeffects. Together with preemptive IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blockade using tocilizumab; thisallows for application of effective bsAb doses with expected high anticancer activity. Thestudy comprises two phases: The first phase is a dose-escalation phase with concomitantprophylactic application of tocilizumab to evaluate the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) ofCC-1. This is followed by a dose-expansion phase (also with prophylactic IL-6R blockade usingtocilizumab). A translational research program comprising; among others; analysis of CC-1half-life and the induced immune response as well as molecular profiling in liquid biopsieswill serve to better define the mode of action of CC-1 and to identify biomarkers for furtherclinical development.; SCC of the lung is an aggressive malignant disease with poor prognosis after failure ofestablished therapies. Any drug employed after second-line treatment is associated with onlylimited clinical benefit. Therefore; there is a high medical need for new therapeuticapproaches in this patient population. The clinical effects of immune checkpoint inhibitorsin NSCLC have proven the potential of T-cell based immunotherapy in this entity. Therationale for the therapeutic use of CC-1 is based on its proposed mode of action as a bsAbbeing specifically designed to direct T cells via its CD3 binding part towards tumor targetcells via its PSMA binding part. Furthermore; CC-1 also reacts with tumor vessels of NSCLCthereby allowing for a dual mode of anti-cancer action by also attacking tumor blood supplyand allowing for improved influx of immune effector cells. Due to its unique ability toredirect T cells via CD3 for PSMA-expressing tumor cell lysis; CC-1 can elicit repeatedtarget cell elimination by cytotoxic T cells and a polyclonal response of previously primedCD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Compared to other immunotherapeutics presently being approved or indevelopment (bsAbs with alternative formats like the authorised bsAb blinatumomab or otherantibodies or CAR T cells); CC-1 is expected to offer the following major advantages:(i) Reduction of off-target T cell activation and thus reduction of side effects due to itsoptimized format (ii) The possibility to tightly steer anti-target activity via serumlevel-controlled antibody application which; in contrast to CAR T cells; allows fortermination of activity if desired.On the background of the poor prognosis of patients with SCC of the lung after second-linetherapy; the bsAb CC-1 holds promise as a new treatment option of immunotherapy for thesepatients.The planned study will include patients with SCC of the lung with detectable PSMA expressionon tumor cells after second line treatment. PSMA expression is to be determined by centralimmunohistochemical assessment of fresh or kryopreserved tumor samples. Only patients withproven PSMA expression on tumor cells as defined by â‰¥10% positivity of tumor cells can beincluded. The requirement of â‰¥10% positivity of tumor cells for PSMA expression cells is inline with definitions of positivity for target antigen expression employed for otherantibodies used in cancer treatment; for example the human epidermal receptor protein-2(HER2)-specific antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Both antibodies are approved for thetreatment of HER2-positive breast cancer; and HER2 positivity is given if â‰¥10% of tumor cellsshow staining for HER2 as assessed by immunohistochemistry .PSMA-positivity is estimated for about 50% of screened patients with SCC of the lung.Further as a translational research program the investigators implemented PSMA-PET CTs atdifferent time points. PSMA positivity in PSMA-PET CT has been described on several tumorentities including tumors of the lung. In line; PSMA expression has been described on tumorcells and neovasculature of tumor in lung cancer; especially SCC of the lung. However; acorrelation of PSMA-PET positive tumors with immunhistochemical PSMA evaluation has so farnot been described.The implementation of PSMA-PET as additional imaging to routine CT; will further improvetreatment for patients with SCC of the lung as results of PSMA-PET may replace biopsy infuture patients. A maximum of three PSMA-PET CTs may be performed.Study rationale with regard to objectives and further development of CC-1In nonclinical studies; in vitro and in vivo; proof of concept; preliminary PK and PK/PDeffects as well as toxicology have been evaluated. However; due to differences between animalmodels and the human situation; some aspects have to be assessed and further characterised inhumans. For example; the target mediated drug disposition (TMDD); an effect that largelyinfluences the serum half-life of antibody molecules particularly at low concentrations;cannot be properly addressed in mice. Furthermore; non-human primates (NHP) and rodents haveseveral limitations as predictive models for toxicity and immunogenicity evaluation of CC-1.The CD3 binding part of CC-1 does not cross-react with CD3 of macaques and thus it is notpossible to evaluate in these NHPs dose limiting side effects. Likewise; although CC-1 iscross-reactive with macaque-PSMA; PSMA distribution in macaques significantly differs fromthat in humans. The same holds true for rodents.Due to the high medical need for patients with SCC of the lung after second-line treatment;the planned phase I trial is designed to confirm and further explore the safety andtolerability of the PSMAxCD3 bsAb CC-1 in adult patients with SCC of the lung. The primaryobjective is incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) under therapy with CC-1.Furthermore; the trial aims to expand experience on pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics andtoxicology of CC-1 from nonclinical studies to the human situation in relation to the PK;expected efficacy and safety. A focus will be on the following specific aspects/parameters:-Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CC-1 in humans-Immunogenicity of CC-1 in humans based on both absolute (number and percentage ofsubjects who develop human anti-human antibody (HAHA).-Absolute changes from baseline in laboratory parameters-Change in cytokines from baseline-Assessment of response rate by RECIST on routine imaging-Evaluation of PSMA PET CT in a translational research program-Overall and progression free survivalRationale for preemptive IL-6R blockade by TocilizumabAs described above; in the planned study the investigators exploit the strategy to usetocilizumab rather to prevent development of CRS in the first place than to treat CRS once ithas arisen.This strategy holds promise to increase the safety of study patients and timely studyconduct. By starting the study treatment with CC-1 directly with prophylactic tocilizumab;all study patients will benefit from the expected advantage of this combination with regardto safety and can be treated with sufficiently high doses of CC-1 to achieve dose levels highenough to hopefully result in efficacy effects.The rationale for preemptive IL-6R blockade by tocilizumab treatment is based on i. Thefirmly established efficiency and safety of tocilizumab for the treatment of CRSii. Lack of clear evidence for increased tumor growth as potential drawback of IL-6R blockageiii. Observations that IL-6 activity; while being responsible for the undesirable sequelae ofCRS; appears not to be required for the therapeutic activity of CC-1 CRS that was induced bytherapy with the approved bsAb blinatumomab was reported to be successfully treated bytocilizumab. Most importantly; despite rapid disappearance of clinical CRS symptoms; thetherapeutic activity of the bsAb blinatumomab was maintained. Furthermore; tocilizumab wasalso used in the very recent FIH study with the REGN1917 (CD20xCD3) antibody.Our own nonclinical studies demonstrate that tocilizumab does not impair the therapeuticactivity of CC-1; neither in vitro nor in vivo. This is in contrast to steroids which arecurrently recommended and used as pre- and concomitant treatment to prevent CRS uponblinatumomab therapy.Due to the mechanism of action of tocilizumab; there is a theoretical risk of tumordevelopment or tumor progression due to immune modulation. On the basis of the currentliterature derived from large studies conducted in Japan; the USA and Europe; however; thereis no evidence for an increased tumor risk upon application of tocilizumab. Only one Japanesestudy described a minimally increased risk of de novo lymphoma development. However; thiscould not be confirmed in any other study. Especially for lung cancer; there is no evidencefor an increased incidence rate. Interestingly; high systemic IL-6 levels are associated withdismal prognosis in NSCLC. Furthermore; tocilizumab is currently being investigated inseveral Phase I/II studies for the treatment of solid and hematological neoplasia withoutevidence for an influence on tumor pathophysiology. Based on these findings; no relevantnegative effects of tocilizumab on the efficacy and safety of CC-1 are expected.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2020-05-08,2020-08-03,2022-02-02,Interventional,N/A,Treatment,Carcinoma; Squamous Cell|Lung Neoplasms,third line therapy|SCC|Metastatic squamous cell cancer,Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) (CTCAE V5.0) over 22 days.

Good circumstantial evidence exists for a pathogenic role for molecular mimicry in GBSpathogenesis;especially with its axonal forms; providing insights that could guide futureimmunotherapy :Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE) .Clinical presentation is a sudden onset of rapidly progressive and symmetrical weakness ofthe limbs; with or without peripheral sensory disturbance; reduction in or loss of tendonreflexes ; and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing elevated protein concentrationswith a normal white cell count; termed albuminocytologic dissociation; to distinguish it frominfections that typically demonstrate elevated protein and white cell counts. The symptomstypically reach maximal severity within four weeks from symptom onset. Most patientsgenerally require hospitalization for treatment; with close cardiopulmonary monitoringperformed. Many patients also develop symptoms or signs of autonomic nervous systemdysfunction; termed dysautonomia. These commonly consist of sinus tachycardia; arrhythmias;;orthostatic hypotension; increased sweating and bladder and gastrointestinal dysfunction.Antecedent infections; typically within 4 weeks of neurological symptom onset; commonly occurin GBS patients; resulting in the commonly cited molecular mimicry hypothesis; in which theimmune system becomes activated in response to infectious antigen with structural similarityto peripheral nerve myelin or axonal components; with resultant tissue-specific peripheralnerve and nerve root injury in susceptible individuals.Epidemiological data implies that about two-thirds of GBS adult patients had a priorrespiratory or gastrointestinal infection.Pathophysiology and immunopathology of thepreceding infections are pathogenically associated with GBS; and may play an essential rolein triggering the initial peripheral nerve/ nerve root-specific systemic immune systemactivation that causes cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses with resultantdemyelination; axonal injury or both involving peripheral nerves and roots.Optimal treatment of individual patients may depend on the pathogenesis and clinicalseverity. Patients with severe forms of GBS may possibly need more intensive treatment torecover. Patients with a milder course that fully recover after standard therapy could sufferfrom possibly more side effects of more aggressive forms of treatment. This could only bepossible if there are prognostic models that accurately predict the clinical course inindividual patients. Ideally such models should be based on clinical and biologicalpredictors that are strongly associated with disease course and known as early as possible inthe acute phase of illness; when treatment with immunomodulatory therapy is most effective.Prognostic models could help to guide selective trials in specific GBS subtypes. Because ofthis it will be possible to treat GBS with more effective and more individual therapy,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2021-04-15,2021-06-16,2021-08-04,Observational,NA,NA,Guillain-Barre Syndrome|Syndrome,predictors and prognostic factors of outcome,clinical scales :The GBS Disability Scale.

NCT05005481,Incidence and Factors Affecting the Development and Outcome of Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) - A Single-centre Prospective Cohort Study.; Incidence and Factors Affecting the Development and Outcome of Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) - A Single-centre Prospective Cohort Study.,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Incidence of Phantom Limb Pain; Phantom Limb Pain<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Phantom limb pain (PLP); defined as pain felt in the missing portion of the amputated limbfollowing amputation; occurs in a significant percentage of patients who undergo limbamputation and it is among the most difficult chronic pain syndromes to treat. Its incidencehas been reported to be around 70% though a local pilot study in 2013 reported the incidenceto be 25%. The investigators aim to determine the actual incidence of PLP by conducting asingle-centre prospective cohort study and identify risk factors associated with PLP.Subsequently; the investigators will use identified risk factors to develop and validate arisk prediction model for PLP after amputation surgery and design interventional studiesaimed at reducing the development of PLP in high risk patients.; Specific aims:By using prospective design and validated multidimensional pain questionnaire; theinvestigators aim to better estimate the true incidence of PLP; other associated risk factorsand the severity of functional impairment.This study is divided into 2 phases; of which the first phase of the study would be coveredby the scope of the grant.Phase 1 Primary Aim 1. To determine the local incidence of PLP at 3 months post amputationsurgery (as literature suggests that PLP is most likely to develop within 3 months ofamputation surgery) Hypothesis It is hypothesized that the incidence of PLP is estimated tobe 41-85% from the literature .Secondary Aims 1. Analyse and delineate modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors (patient;anaesthetic and surgical factors) contributing to the development of PLP. 2. Identify factorslikely to prevent or reduce the development of PLP after amputation surgery 3. To identifyfactors prognosticating patient outcomes and recovery from PLP.Phase 2 (out of the scope of the grant) Aims:1. To follow up patients prospectively to identify the long-term functional and psychologicaleffects of PLP on patientsBackground information:According to International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP); Phantom limb pain (PLP)is defined as pain felt in the absent body part. PLP occurs in a significant percentage ofpatients who undergo limb amputation and it is among the most difficult chronic paincondition to treat. Undertreated PLP; together with other persistent chronic pain secondaryto amputation can lead to limitations in both physical and psychosocial function and impairtheir rehabilitation.The true prevalence of PLP among people with amputation is unclear; especially among Asianpopulation. There are various reports of PLP prevalence ranging from 40% to 80% depending onthe site of amputation; the patient population; and the time since amputation.The exact reason why some patients develop phantom pain after amputation is still unknown.The development of PLP is likely multifactorial and includes peripheral; central; andpsychological factors. Several risk factors associated with the development of PLP have beenidentified in various studies but the overall results are rather conflicting. Risk factorssuch as persisting pre-operative pain; stump pain; patient comorbidity contribute to theonset of PLP. The majority of these studies; however; are based on Caucasian population.Nevertheless; it is increasingly clear that patients with PLP will continue to rise locallyin view of higher prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus and malignancy; largely attributed toageing population. In Singapore; major lower extremity amputation rate has increased from11.0 per 100;000 population in 2008 to 13.3 per 100;000 population in 2013. It was reportedin 2001 that approximately 700 lower extremity amputation (LEA) were performed in patientswith diabetes annually. The figures more than doubled to 1500 LEA annually in 2017; due tocomplications arising from diabetes.Despite anticipating PLP to be a significant burgeoning healthcare burden; PLP isunderreported and undertreated; leading to poor rehabilitation outcome. There is also apaucity on local data; with only one ever publication related to PLP in Singapore. The lackof local data in terms of definitive incidence estimate in our population; the functionalimpairment from PLP and potential risk factors has greatly hindered the development orimplementation of effective interventions for preventing or treating PLP. Thus; the primaryaim of this study is to establish the incidence of PLP in our local population; the riskfactors associated with PLP and its functional impact.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2021-08-05,2021-08-13,2021-09-26,Observational,NA,NA,Phantom Limb,NA,Incidence of Phantom Limb Pain; Phantom Limb Pain,; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,13,8,2021,blah,1234,1234,1234

Thesetests have been widely applied in adult cirrhosis. The accuracy of these models; however; maybe influenced by patient factors including age; body mass index; and diabetes; potentiallylimiting their prognostic accuracy and clinical practicability in children. Therefore; it iscurrently unknown how to best predict hepatic decompensation and survival outcomes amongpediatric patients with cirrhosis. To fill this knowledge gap; the investigators performed aretrospective-prospective cohort study with the aim of developing and validating a clinicalmodel to predict liver-related complications and survival outcomes in pediatric patients withbiopsy-proven with cirrhosis.

This will help gathering moreinformation on the results of particle therapy and will provide the basis for in depthevaluation of patients' outcome with respect to the delivered treatment.; Hadrontherapy is a unique radiotherapy (RT) that uses positively charged particles; namelyprotons and carbons; rather than photons used in conventional RT; to treat cancer.Particle therapy represents a coming together of physics research applied to oncology and itis currently the most advanced form of radiotherapy for the treatment of tumors that areparticularly radio resistant or located nearby sensitive structures.The strength ofhadrontherapy lies in the unique physical and radiobiological properties of these particles.Indeed; protons and carbon ions have several biological advantages compared to conventionalphoton radiotherapy.In this scenario we aim at constructing a patient registry to retrospectively andprospectively collect real-world data on all cancer patients treated at CNAO; either withprotons or carbon ion radiation; independently of their disease (multiple cohorts will beincluded) for which they were treated.We aim at collecting data on the natural history of the disease (how the disease presents;develops and progress; its association with other conditions). Those data will allow us toassess prognostic and predictive factors to evaluate treatment effects and toxicities and toprovide evidence of the role of radiation oncology in a multidisciplinary approach.Such registry will be used to generate clinical evidence and high-quality data that couldbetter define the indications for heavy particles therapy and become a resource for the widerscientific community.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2022-01-10,2022-01-24,2022-01-10,Observational [Patient Registry],NA,NA,Neoplasms|Rare Diseases,Hadrontherapy|Oncology|Cancer|Radiotherapy|Protons|Carbon Ions|Heavy ions|Rare cancer,Real world data collection; To collect real world data of patients treated with radiotherapy; to support particle radiotherapy and to provide evidence of the role of radiation oncology within the multidisciplinary approach.,Disease evolution Predicitive models Outcome data Toxicities QoL Future research; To analyze the disease course and treatment performed by collecting demographic; disease characteristics and delivered treatment To collect details about the radiation treatment and radiobiological parameters to develop predictive models (outcome and toxicity) To collect outcome data (in terms of overall survival; progression free-survival and local control) and to correlate them with the delivered treatment To define acute; intermediate and late toxicities; according to CTCAE v 5.0 and to correlate it with the delivered treatment To collect data on standardized QoL questionnaires and PROMS (e;g EORTC C30; EQDL) at 6; 12. 18; 24; 36 months and to correlate them with the delivered treatment To generate hypotheses for further research,1234,1234,1234,1234,24,1,2022,blah,1234,1234,1234

The investigators believethat the MyChart platform; and ML techniques can be utilized to collect; and analyze outcomedata for breast cancer patients experiencing VMS.; Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are a common consequence of systemic therapies for breast cancer.Breast cancer treatments can cause VMS in approximately 30% of postmenopausal women and 95%of premenopausal women with early stage breast cancer (EBC). In addition to their negativeimpact on quality of life; unmanaged VMS are the most common reason for discontinuation ofpotentially curative treatment in 25-60% of EBC patients. Estrogen replacement is a commontreatment for VMS in the general population; however; it is contraindicated in breast cancerpatients. There are many non-estrogen-based interventions available to manage VMS; including;lifestyle modifications; complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. However; arecent systematic review and meta-analysis of pharmacological and CAM interventions conductedby our team; found no single optimal treatment for VMS management in breast cancer patients.The investigators recently conducted a survey in 373 patients with EBC which found that whilethe majority of patients were interested in receiving an intervention to mitigate theirsymptoms; only 18% received a treatment for this problem. In addition; more than one third ofpatients experiencing VMS report that they are not routinely asked about their symptoms inroutine follow up.

Although rarely acknowledged as a pressing health care issue; leg ulcers comprise acommon; complex; and costly condition; managed primarily through community home careservices. Indeed; leg ulcers are the most frequently seen and treated chronic wound. There isconsensus in recent international; evidence-based practice guidelines that graduated;multi-layer compression is the most effective treatment; and greatly reduces healing time.High compression is more effective than low compression. However; there is no clear evidenceas to which high compression technology is the most effective in promoting healing; the mostacceptable to patients; or the most cost-effective to the health care system. This study isdesigned to answer these questions through a randomized trial conducted in the community;where most leg ulcer care currently takes place. Issues such as effectiveness in healing;quality of life; physical discomfort; personal preference; cost to the system and to theindividual will be taken into consideration in evaluating two most commonly used types ofcompression bandaging.; Background:Although rarely recognized as a pressing health care problem; leg ulcers comprise a common;complex; and costly condition. Over 80% of ongoing management of chronic wounds occurs in thecommunity; and leg ulcers are one of the most frequently seen chronic wounds. The cost of legulcer care is considerable; being reported in both the UK and France to account for 2% oftheir total national health budgets. In Canada; the impact is only now being recognized dueto the pressure on home care caseloads resulting from hospital downsizing; nursing shortages;and growing numbers of complex health populations. In one Ontario study; the care for fewerthan 200 community leg ulcer cases cost in excess of $1.5 million for supplies and nursingvisits; which translates to $100s of millions yearly Canada-wide. The impact on theindividual is significant--chronic; painful; and often takes years to heal. Two-thirds ofindividuals with leg ulcers have at least one recurrence; and 45% have a history with thecondition dating back 10 years.State of Knowledge & Clinical Practice Guidelines:Over the past decade; evidence from RCT studies and a recent Cochrane systematic review inBMJ demonstrated that venous leg ulcers treated with compression therapy are more likely toheal. Multi-layer high compression systems are more effective than low compression. However;the small number of people in trials comparing different high compression systems meant thereview was unable to draw conclusions about their relative merit. Four of these trials havecompared 4-layer bandage with short stretch technologies--the most commonly used technologiesin Canada. In total; these trials involved only 220 patients; and were thus underpowered.Furthermore; they did not consider factors such as client preference and ease of use; orincorporate an economic evaluation.Plan of Investigation:The study will be a multi-centre; pragmatic; randomised trial of two types of compressionbandaging technologies; incorporating an economic evaluation.Research objective: To compare the effectiveness of 2 high compression technologies deliveredin the community on ulcer healing; recurrence rates; quality of life; and cost-effectiveness.Interventions: Four-layer bandage vs. Short-stretch bandage. Sample size: 414 total; 207 ineach arm (80% power;  0.05 to detect 4 week difference in time to heal).Inclusion Criteria: leg ulcer>1 cm in any one dimension; minimum duration of 1 week;ABPI>0.7.Randomization: will be carried out and stratified by: Clinical Centre (3 Health Regions inOntario); Margolis' Prognostic Model (ulcer area and duration); Ulcer episode (1st orrecurrent ulcer).Analysis: Primary outcome: time-to-healing of the reference ulcer.Secondary outcomes: quality of life & expenditures for treatment. Durability of healing willbe assessed-follow-up for up to 52 weeks post-healing to determine recurrence ratesassociated with both technologies.Summary:There is consensus internationally in recommending the application of graduated multi-layercompression.

In this connection; the individual prognosis depends on a complex interaction oftumor- and patient-related factors. To take account of such differences; it is necessary toemploy individual methods of treatment which are suited to the course of each patient'sdisease. Prof. Possinger and Dr. Schmid (Charite Berlin) and Prof. Wischnewsky (University ofBremen) have developed an approach that can help to achieve this goal with the aid ofcomputerized machine learning techniques (MLT).The use of machine learning methods can be beneficial in oncology in two respects. On the onehand; an attempt can be made to individually estimate clinically relevant parameters like;for example; the recurrence probability or expected survival time as precisely as possiblebased on the established prognostic factors. And on the other hand; it may be possible withthe aid of MLT to understand structural relationships between the clinical result andmeasured or established tumor-/patient-related variables.To analyze the possible benefits of machine learning techniques for patients with metastaticbreast cancer; the aim of study FEM-D-2 is to investigate whether it is possible tocharacterize those patients who either do or do not respond to a specific treatment with aprecision of 90%; prospectively estimate the time until worsening of the disease under agiven treatment; and classify patients in groups with favorable and poor chances ofmedium-term survival.The use of inductive learning algorithms with machine learning also makes it possible to veryaccurately estimate the time until progression of the tumor growth. In patients who respondto letrozole therapy; the time until tumor progression depends on factors like pain; age;body mass index; disease-free interval; main localization of metastatic spread; and responseto previous estrogen therapy. Only very minimal differences are found when comparing theactual time until progression of the disease and that calculated by the system (at least forsurvival times < 1 year). Furthermore; using machine learning techniques it has becomepossible to use initial data assessed before a letrozole treatment to estimate the survivaltime and distinguish patients with a high risk of dying soon from other patients with a morefavorable prognosis.; ,TRUE,prognostic,development,Terminated,NA,2005-10-14,2005-10-18,2012-04-18,Interventional,Non-Randomized,Treatment,Breast Neoplasms|Letrozole,Breast cancer|Machine learning techniques|Aromatase inhibitors|1st line treatment|2nd line treatment,Comparison of the the individual pretherapeutic predictions from the computer or doctor with the patient data obtained in a first- or second-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer after progression of the disease; ,Determination of the individual response at 3 monthly assessments; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,18,10,2005,blah,1234,1234,1234

Heartfailure management programs have been developed to reduce the frequency and severity of theseclinical events; but their effectiveness may be limited by physicians' difficulty inidentifying patients at imminent risk. Reliable prediction of these events may affordphysicians the opportunity to intervene aggressively and potentially minimize the need forhospitalization or the risk of a serious adverse outcome.Noninvasive impedance cardiography (ICG) is a simple test that utilizes changes in thoracicelectrical impedance to measure thoracic fluid content; changes in the duration of cardiacejection and the velocity of blood flow within the aorta. ICG has been used to estimatecardiac output and cardiac filling pressure in patients with or without heart failure (HF).PREVENT-HF is a randomized prospective study being conducted at up to 35 experiencedinvestigative centers from the United States; Canada; and Europe. Subjects will be enrolledwithin 4-12 days of a discharge from a hospitalization for exacerbation of heart failure;with screening procedures to occur prior to the enrollment. Following enrollment; subjectswill be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to outpatient management by either clinical assessment(Standard Care Arm) or ICG in addition to clinical assessment (ICG Arm) during the enrollmentvisit. ICG variables will be collected in all subjects but will be blinded in the StandardCare Arm. Each subject's study participation will last for a minimum of 24 weeks and amaximum of 52 weeks post-discharge. Four weeks after hospital discharge; subjects will visitthe clinic. Remaining study visits will occur every four weeks thereafter until the subjecthas completed the 52-week visit or until the subject has experienced a hospitalization thathas been adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee as being a heart failurehospitalization.In the PREDICT study; a composite ICG score was the most powerful predictor of a short-termHF event when compared to standard clinical variables. This composite ICG score is providedfor subjects in the PREVENT-HF ICG Arm. If the score indicates a subject is at a higher riskfor a short-term HF event; clinicians will be required to intervene.

However; a detectable troponin release occurs only in a part of patientsadmitted with ACS. The clinical outcomes and further prognosis of patients with ACS withabsent TnT release vary widely; and the identification of potential high-risk patients withtroponin negative ACS still remains a major problem in clinical routine. Therefore; the aimof this study is focused on identifying new biomarkers for risk stratification.Activated Factor <br><br>XII: Activated Factor XII leads to contact activation and a number ofpathophysiological processes; including hypotension; inflammation; thrombosis andfibrinolysis; are affected by contact activation following the activation of XIIa. Severalstudies have demonstrated a relation between XIIa and coronary artery heart disease (CAD)(1;2;3;4) and that XIIa levels post MI predict recurrent coronary occlusive events and play arole as an independent risk marker in these patients (5).However; the detailed mechanisms of XIIa's actions in CAD still remain uncertain althoughrecent findings in animal studies using FXII deficient mice indicate that Factor XII isessential for arterial thrombus formation (6).Recent research indicates that in-vivo XIIa exists in multiple types and that in-vivo XIIacan exist in the circulation complexed to a variety of other proteins (7). To date; no dataexist on the prognostic value of specific in-vivo types of XIIa on outcome in patients withchest pain and/or ACS.B-type natriuretic peptide: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a counter-regulatory peptidehormone predominantly synthesized in the ventricular myocardium. BNP is released into thecirculation in response to ventricular dilatation and pressure overload; and reflectsventricular wall stress and tissue hypoxia rather than cell injury per se (8; 9). It is awell known marker of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (HF); and it providesprognostic information beyond and above left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patientswith an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (10). This marker of neurohormonal activation andinflammation plays a pivotal role across the spectrum of ACS; including patients withST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) and non ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). Previous studieshave demonstrated that BNP measured in the first days after the onset of symptomsindependently predicts mortality; HF; and new MI in this patient population. Elevatednatriuretic peptides at presentation have been shown to identify patients with ACS who are athigher risk of death and HF; and it adds information to that provided by the troponins(11-13). However; in a low-risk population the association between elevated BNP and survivalis attenuated when adjustment is made for echocardiographic variables (in addition toclinical covariates); as shown by Wang and colleagues. In addition; they did not find anyassociation between baseline BNP and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (14).High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP): C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phasereactant that is produced in response to acute injury; infection or other inflammationstimuli. It is a marker for underlying systemic inflammation and plays an important role inthe initiation and propagation of atherosclerosis and ultimately to plaque rupture and theensuing thrombotic complication (15) Elevated levels of CRP were first reported in patientshospitalized with NSTE-ACS in the early 1990s (16; 17). Through the use of appropriatehigh-sensitive assays; it has been possible to investigate the relationship between plasmaCRP levels that previously were considered to be normal and cardiovascular disease (CVD).Nevertheless; it is still under debate which markers should be preferred for risk prediction(18; 19). It has been suggested that the combined evaluation of BNP and CRP may yieldincremental prognostic information in the risk stratification of patients with ACS (20); andtheir combined use has been shown to improve long-term risk prediction of mortality inpatients with stable CHD (21). To our knowledge; there are limited data available thatdirectly compare these two markers in a prospective manner in an unselected patientpopulation presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. In addition; theirrole in risk stratification in patients with ACS is still under evaluation; and thereforeadditional investigations are necessary.Omega- 3 Index: The value of the Omega-3 Index as a prognostic marker in the acute coronarysyndromes is still under investigation.STUDY DESIGN This prospective single center observational non-invasive trial includes 871 menand women admitted with chest pain and potential ACS at the Stavanger University Hospitalbetween November 2002 and October 2003. Blood samples were collected immediately followingadmission. Patients were stratified according to peak troponin T (TnT) release followingadmission; i.e. 1) patients with an admission TnT exceeding 0.05 ng/mL; and 2) patients witha peak TnT level of 0.05 ng/mL or lower.Assessment of a history of previous MI; angina pectoris (AP); congestive heart failure (CHF);diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension was based on hospital records and personalinterview. Electrocardiographic findings at admission were classified according to thepresence of ST segment changes.Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Survival status; date and cause ofdeath and clinical data were obtained by telephone interview and hospital journal reports at4 predefined time points (30 days; 6; 12 and 24 months) during the two year follow-up period.In case of incapacity to provide information; the general practitioner or nursery home werecontacted for relevant data.

At the present time; IL-2 is the only therapy for kidney cancerthat can produce a remission of disease that lasts after treatment is completed. However;most patients who receive IL-2 do not benefit and all patients experience potentiallydangerous side effects.Recent research has suggested that certain patients may respond better to IL-2 than others.The Cytokine Working Group is currently conducting a clinical trial that aims to identify andconfirm this research and narrow the application of IL-2 to those patients most likely tobenefit.; <br><br>OBJECTIVES:Primary-To determine; in a prospective fashion; if the response rate to high-dose IL-2 forpatients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and good pathologic predictive featuresis significantly higher than a historical; unselected patient population.Secondary-To determine; in a prospective fashion; the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patientswith metastatic renal cell carcinoma and poor pathologic predictive features and tocompare this response rate to the response rate of patients with good pathologicpredictive features.-To determine if components of other predictive and prognostic models (e.g MSKCI or UCLAcriteria) can help to further define the optimal population to receive high-dose IL2 formetastatic renal cell carcinoma.-To identify features of the baseline immune function (arginine; arginase; T cell zetachain) of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that are associated withresponse to high-dose IL-2.-To identify new proteins or patterns of gene expression that might be associated withhigh-dose IL-2 responsiveness in order to further narrow the application of IL-2 therapyto those who will benefit the most.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Completed,NA,2007-11-06,2007-11-07,2021-05-12,Interventional,N/A,Treatment,Carcinoma|Carcinoma; Renal Cell|Aldesleukin,Kidney|Renal Cell|Metastatic|interleukin-2|select,Objective Response in ISM Good Risk Group; The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on treatment based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.

It may be useful to find out how well these findings correlate with thepreviously known clinical predictors in term of the clinical outcomes that will happen in thefuture for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).; Prognostic models; which have been produced based on clinical; histological and biochemicalfeature; are useful in predicting survival and determining timing for liver transplantation.Preliminary feasibility studies in patients with PSC using high resolution CT with a contrastagent (CT cholangiography); has shown excellent depiction of bile ducts. CT cholangiographyalso has the potential to allow quantification of intraductal volume by using sophisticatedcomputer programs. This assessment may be an important clinical feature to assess diseaseseverity and progression.The information about cholangiographic features could be importantfor therapeutic decisions (e.g.; in determining the usefulness of balloon dilatation orstenting for a dominant extrahepatic duct stricture); for counseling patients; and fortherapeutic trials in stratifying patients and assessing efficacy of treatment.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Withdrawn,NA,2007-12-26,2008-01-08,2015-04-27,Interventional,N/A,NA,Cholangitis|Cholangitis; Sclerosing,Primary sclerosing cholangitis|Computed tomographic cholangiography|MELD score|Mayo risk score for PSC,To determine the correlation between baseline characteristics of bile ducts and intraductal volume of the biliary tree by CT cholangiography and MELD score and the Mayo risk score in patients with PSC.; ,To determine the correlation between change in characteristics of bile ducts and intraductal volume of the biliary tree by CT cholangiography and change in MELD score and the Mayo risk score after 2-years of follow-up as compared with baseline.; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,8,1,2008,blah,1234,1234,1234

NCT00875251,Growth and Body Composition of Very Low Birth Weight Infants Compared With Infants Birth at Term; Growth and Body Composition in Preterm Infants,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:body composition; fat mass and fat free mass from PEA BOD<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:anthropometry; Anthropometry assesment : weight; lenght; head circunference; skinfold thikness; BMI<br><br>SUMMARY:Growth is traditionally used as a prognostic measure after admission to a neonatal intensivecare unit (NICU). Quality of neonatal intensive care is one of the factors determining thehealth and quality of life for those that survive; with the principal objective of increasingdisability-free survival. Nowadays; there is some researches showing us that these pretermbabies present a different body composition when they achieve term age compared with babiesbirth at term and this condition could be putting these babies in risk to metabolic syndromeearly in adult age. The majority of infants born between 24 and 29 weeks of gestational agefail to achieve the mean birth weight for fetuses of the same gestational age; and many weighbelow the 10th percentile at hospital discharge. The focus of this study is the growth andbody composition of very low birth weight infants growing in the extrauterine environment.The central question is; when they reach the corresponding term weight; is the bodycomposition of newborns growing outside of the uterus different from that of infants growingin the intrauterine environment? The investigators are also trying to validate 3 differentmethods to research body composition: DXA; air-displacement plethysmography and electricbioimpedance.; <br><br>OBJECTIVESGENERAL:Evaluate the growth and body composition of VLBW infants upon reaching the corresponding termgestational age (GA) and weight.<br><br>SPECIFIC:A) Evaluate the longitudinal growth and body composition of VLBW infants from the first weekof life and at the corresponding term GA and weight.B) Relate the weight loss in the first week of life to the weight and percentage of totalbody water at the corresponding term GA and weight.C) Compare the body composition of VLBW newborns growing in the extrauterine environment uponreaching the corresponding term GA and weight with the body composition of term newborns;using the 3 methods (DEXA; air-displacement plethysmography; and electric bioimpedance) D)Adjust a predictive model for body weight estimates using the parameters furnished bymulti-frequency and single-frequency electric bioimpedance and anthropometry; with themeasurements provided by DEXA and plethysmography as the gold standard.E) Relate body weight and composition at the corresponding term GA to neonatal morbidity.METHODOLOGY Study characteristics A mixed longitudinal study will be conducted. The newbornswill be included at different gestational ages and will remain in the study until reachingthe corresponding term gestational age and weight (2;800g to 3;200g).Study site The study will be performed at the Fernandes Figueira Institute (IFF); a unit ofthe Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro; Brazil.Study population The study population will consist of premature newborns with gestational ageless than 32 weeks and/or with intrauterine growth restriction. Data will be collectedbeginning at birth during hospitalization and in the outpatient follow-up after hospitaldischarge.Definitions and established criteriaEvaluation of the adequacy of weight in relation to gestational age was based on the curve byAlexander et al. (1996); defining SGA as newborns with birth weight below the 10th percentilein relation to gestational age; AGA was defined as between the 10th and 90th percentiles; andlarge for gestational age (LGA) as above the 90th percentile.Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) This study defines IUGR as a Z-score for the newborn'sbirth weight for gestational age less than or equal to -2. The study will use thesex-specific Canadian reference for birth weight for gestational age; which uses the 3rd;5th; 10th; 50th (mean); 90th; 95th; and 97th percentiles for 22 to 43 complete weeks andstandard deviation (Kramer et al; 2001).Z-score. The measurements to be used with references for obtaining the Z-score will be thoseof Fenton et al.Gestational age Gestational age will be based on the mother's date of last menstrual period.In case of doubt; confirmation will be obtained by the date of gestational age estimated byfirst-trimester ultrasound or; if necessary; by the Ballard method (Ballard et al; 1991);which estimates gestational age based on the newborn's somatic characteristics andneurological evaluation.Corrected gestational age After obtaining gestational age at birth; age will be correctedover the course of the study by adding the weeks of post-natal life. Each age in weeks willconsider the variation from zero to six days.Morbidities-Bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be defined as any newborn in use of oxygen therapy at 36weeks corrected gestational age.-Late-onset sepsis will be defined as a positive blood or CSF culture in the presence ofclinical signs of sepsis after 72 hours of life or clinical infection with a negativeculture after 72 hours of life for newborns that have received 5 or more days ofantibiotic therapy.-Necrotizing enterocolitis will be considered when classified as stage II A or higheraccording to the modified Bell criteria (Walsh & Kleigman; 1986).-Severe intraventricular hemorrhage will be defined as grade 3 or 4 according to thescale described by Papile et al (1978).Measurements of body weight; length; foot size; triceps skinfold; mid-arm circumference; andtotal body water will be taken at 5 moments in the premature infants: in the first 24 hoursof life; at the 7th day of life after recovering birth weight; at term (GA â‰¥ 37 < 42 weeks);and with weight from 2;800 to 3;200g. The two latter measurements may be taken after hospitaldischarge; during outpatient follow-up. These variables will be evaluated in the first 24hours of life in the term newborns with weight from 2;800g to 3;200g.Anthropometric Evaluation Measurements will be performed by the researcher; followingprevious training; considering the mean of the three measurements. The newborn will bemeasured unclothed and kept under previously prescribed heating; except during weighing.Weight Weight will be measured with a Filizola brand digital scale accurate to 5 grams; aftertaring it before each weighing.Length Length will be measured using an anthropometric ruler designed and manufactured at theprecision workshop of the University of SÃ£o Paulo in RibeirÃ£o Preto; SÃ£o Paulo State.The newborn will be placed in the supine position on a flat surface as stiff as possible;adjusting the child's head in a medial position on the ruler's fixed surface. Holding thechild in this position with the knees extended by an assistant; the ruler's mobile extremitywill be moved until the ruler is perfectly adjusted to the soles of the newborn's feet.Head circumference Head circumference will be measured using a non-elastic tape measuremarked in millimeters. The tape measure will be adjusted to the newborn's head; passing infront across the supra-orbital region; above the eyebrows; and behind across the occipitalbulge; recording the largest circumference obtained.Foot size The measurement is taken with a caliper marked in millimeters; adjusting it to thelargest diameter of the infant's right foot.Triceps Skinfold (TSF) Triceps skinfold measurements will be taken with a Harpenden typecaliper; which measures in millimeters; accurate to 0.1mm.This measurement will always be taken on the right arm; at the midpoint between the acromionand the olecranon; immediately below the skin hollow; with the arm extended. The measurementrecorded will be that obtained after stabilizing the caliper pointers (approximately 60seconds).Mid-arm circumference (MAC) This circumference will be obtained; always from the left arm; atthe midpoint between the acromion and the olecranon; just below the skin hollow; with the armextended and the hand in prone position; with a non-elastic millimeter tape measure (Sasanowet al; 1986). The location is the same as that of the triceps skinfold.Mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) This parameter aims to measure the arm's muscle size andthus indirectly indicate the newborn's nutritional status during extrauterine growth. It uses2 combined measurements; the triceps skinfold and the mid-arm circumference.Body composition evaluation Body composition will be evaluated using the 3 methods availableat the Fernandes Figueira Institute (BIA; plethysmography; and DEXA). The study will measuretotal body water; lean mass; and body fat.Bioimpedance measurements will be made with the RJL System (Quantum BIA 101Q equipment) andthe Hydra multi-frequency equipment (Xitron technologies) . Both pieces of equipment areinexpensive and the tests are non-invasive and can be performed at bedside. However; neitherof them is validated for measuring body fat in newborns and infants (first year of life).We will use quadripolar electrodes preferably on the right hand and foot. The electrodes arecut in Â± 1 cm strips and attached to the hand and foot with a minimum distance of 3 cmbetween them (wrist and ankle flexure and immediately before the base of the fingers andtoes). The anatomical criterion for positioning the electrodes was chosen based on the factthat the study focuses on human beings during their growth process; which can double ortriple the birth weight during the study period. The newborns are measured before feeding; inprone position; wearing dry disposable diapers. The arms are kept away from the trunk and thelegs should not touch each other. The infant should be comfortable and quiet; and themeasurements should be recorded when the variation is no greater than Â± 1 point. Thedifference in the resistance values obtained between the distal positions (right hand andright foot; right hand and left foot; left hand and left foot; and left hand and right foot)is not significant; and the electrodes can thus be used in these positions.The equations used to calculate total body water (TBW) will be those proposed and validatedby Tang Wing et al in 1997; which use 2 anthropometric measurements (weight and foot length)and resistance (R) measured by the electric bioimpedance technique.Body fat percentage and total body composition will be measured by the air-displacementplethysmography in the PEA POD System and in the iDEXA equipment; using the software forsmall animals. Based on these measurements of real body fat; predictive models will beadjusted to estimate body fat using the parameters obtained from bioimpedance (resistance andreactance) and anthropometry (Hull et al; 2008; Roggero et al; 2008; Ellis et al; 2008; Ma etal; 2008).Statistical analysis Data analysis will use Epi Info (Epi - 6.04) from the Centers forDisease Control (CDC - Atlanta; USA).We will use analysis of variance for continuous variables with normal distribution andnon-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests for the others to analyze differences between the groups.The chi-square test will be used for the categorical variables to calculate the difference inproportions. A frequency table will be used for the categorical variables and the mean ormedian and standard deviation for the continuous variables.The models for estimating body fat based on bioimpedance measurements will be fitted usingmultiple linear regression models.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Recruiting,NA,2009-04-02,2009-04-03,2020-09-17,Observational,NA,NA,NA,body composition|preterm infant|anthropometry,body composition; fat mass and fat free mass from PEA BOD,anthropometry; Anthropometry assesment : weight; lenght; head circunference; skinfold thikness; BMI,1234,1234,1234,1234,3,4,2009,blah,1234,1234,1234

This study hopes to identify the most effective way of using existing arthritismedication to minimise the chances of developing permanent disability. Patients will havetheir arthritis activity assessed using an ultrasound machine. If there is still evidence ofactive arthritis the participant's arthritis medication will be increased until the arthritisis in remission. The effectiveness of this approach will be compared to the traditionalmethod of assessing arthritis using clinical examination.Furthermore; it is extremely important to identify those patients most at risk of aggressivedisease. The investigators hope to produce a more accurate measurement of disease prognosisby examining the relationship between a series of blood tests and how well controlledrheumatoid arthritis appears after 18 months of therapy. Some patients will also be asked todonate samples of joint fluid and joint lining for additional analysis.; PURPOSE 1 - to determine whether it is possible to achieve better control of inflammatoryjoint disease activity in early rheumatoid arthritis by using musculoskeletal ultrasound;instead of clinical examination; to identify the presence; or absence; of synovitisNULL HYPOTHESIS 1 - using musculoskeletal ultrasound to confirm / refute the presence ofongoing synovitis will NOT allow better control of early rheumatoid arthritis nor preventprogression of destructive joint disease despite patients receiving more intensive diseasemodifying therapy regimensPURPOSE 2 - to determine whether baseline measures of certain biochemical and pathologicalfactors; associated with the development of inflammatory synovitis; are predictive ofresponse to therapy in early rheumatoid arthritis and short term outcome measures ofinflammatory joint disease activity; functional ability and quality of lifeNULL HYPOTHESIS 2 - serial measures of biochemical and pathological factors; associated withthe development of inflammatory synovitis; will NOT correlate with short term outcomemeasures of disease activity and therefore cannot be used to predict a patient's prognosisnor identify those at risk of progressive; destructive joint diseaseTRIAL DESIGN - randomised; prospective single blinded trial of treatment strategy with anested study correlating baseline measures and 18 month outcomesInvestigators will not be blinded to treatment group. Treatment decisions and escalation oftherapy will be dictated by a standardised protocol. The sequence of therapy escalation willbe identical for both groups. The groups will differ on the threshold needed to progress tothe next treatment stepAssessors of disease activity; radiological and pathological outcomes will be blinded totreatment group and their findings will form the basis of each groups final outcome measuresTREATMENT PROTOCOL - the sequence of therapy escalation will be the same for each group. Thegroups differ by the 'trigger' required to progress to the next treatment step. Therapy willescalated in each group if the measured disease activity exceeds that groups thresholdtrigger. Changes in DMARD therapy doses and/or combinations take three months to reachmaximum effect; therefore; at least a three month gap will be left between each treatmentescalationPRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Dominant Wrist - baseline and 18 months. Images will bescored using the OMERACT RAMRIS(Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score)atlas. The change in each patient's synovitis and erosion scores will be pooled andcompared for each intervention group2. 44 joint Disease Activity Score - Mean change of DAS44 with time will represent the rateof response to treatment.

NCT01144481,Prospective Identification of Risk Factors for Skeletal Related Events in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Bisphosphonates for Bone Metastases; Risk Factors for Skeletal Related Events in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Bisphosphonates for Bone Metastases,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Skeletal related event; Primary outcome is any SRE such as pathological fractures; surgery/radiotherapy for pain/prevention of fractures; hypercalcemia; and spinal cord compression.<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Bone is the most common site of distant breast cancer recurrence; and 65-75% of women withadvanced breast cancer will develop bone metastases during the course of their disease. Themost pressing problem in management of bony metastases today; is the inability to reliablyidentify patients at high risk for skeletal related events (SREs) (such as bone fractures;surgery/radiotherapy for pain or prevention of fractures; high calcium levels; and spinalcord compression) despite the standard use of bone medication (bisphosphonates). Using thelatest innovations both in imaging and blood tests; this novel pilot project will develop arisk model for predicting bone metastases; which will be able to identify patients who wouldmost benefit from novel treatments; such as the multikinase inhibitor Zactima and the Srcinhibitor; AZD0530. Given that approximately 1/3 of patients with metastatic breast cancerand bony disease will sustain an SRE despite use of a bisphosphonate; there is an urgentunmet need in this large population to introduce effective bone protective agents.; Bone is the most common site of distant breast cancer recurrence; and 65-75% of women withadvanced breast cancer will develop bone metastases during the course of their disease. Bonemetastases can significantly adversely impact on quality of life by causing pain and skeletalrelated events (SREs) such as pathological fractures; surgery/radiotherapy forpain/prevention of fractures; hypercalcemia; and spinal cord compression. These complicationsof bone metastases may necessitate multiple medical; surgical; and radiation interventions.Indeed; prior to the widespread use of bisphosphonates; over two thirds (2/3) of women withbone metastases developed at least one SRE. Despite prolonged bisphosphonate use; manypatients will continue to have progression of their bone metastases and develop SREs. Themost pressing problem in management of bony metastases today; is the inability to reliablyidentify patients at high risk for SREs despite standard bisphosphonate use.Using a prospective; observational trial design; we will develop a prognostic model withbaseline serum C-telopeptide (sCTx) as the predictor variable and SREs as the outcomevariable. 60 breast cancer patients with metastases to any site will be approached forparticipation in this prospective single centered study. Baseline characteristics (andpotential risk factors) will be recorded upon study enrollment; including clinical factors(prior fragility fracture; use of corticosteroids; age); bone mineral density; performancestatus; measures of quality of life and pain. Novel markers such as sCTx and bone specificalkaline phosphatase (bALP) will also be assessed. The WHO fracture risk assessment tool(http://www.shef.ac.uk) will be used to estimate baseline fracture risk according toosteoporosis guidelines and a calcium intake diet history will be taken. In addition;assessment of vertebral fractures will take place using two novel techniques; bonedensitometric vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) and high resolution quantitative CT(HR-pQCT). Bone mineral density along with VFA will be performed at baseline and at one yearof treatment.Patients will be assessed every twelve weeks for twenty-four months with regards to: symptomsrelated to SREs; ECOG status; pain (using the BPI; a 7-point scale of analgesic use); andquality of life (using the FACT-BP; and FACT-BTSQ). In addition to being measured atbaseline; sCTx and bALP will be measured every twelve weeks for twenty-four months. Calciumand 25-hydroxy vitamin D will be measured annually as part of regular clinical practice; anda CT scan of the thorax and abdomen as well as a bone scan will be preformed at least onceyearly as part of regular clinical practice for patients with metastatic breast cancer.Using the latest innovations both in imaging and medical biomarkers; this novel pilot projectwill develop a prospective risk model for predicting bone metastases; which will be able toidentify patients who would most benefit from novel treatments; such as the multikinaseinhibitor Zactima and the Src inhibitor; AZD0530.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2010-06-11,2010-06-15,2015-01-06,Observational,NA,NA,Breast Neoplasms|Neoplasm Metastasis|Neoplasms; Second Primary|Bone Neoplasms|Bone Marrow Diseases,bone metastasis|breast cancer|skeletal related event|HR-pQCT|VFA,Skeletal related event; Primary outcome is any SRE such as pathological fractures; surgery/radiotherapy for pain/prevention of fractures; hypercalcemia; and spinal cord compression.,; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,15,6,2010,blah,1234,1234,1234

Myocardial infarctions (re-MIs) defined according to WHO criteria of 1979.<br><br>SUMMARY:The first aim of this trial is to assess the long-term prognostic value of Omega-3 index;which is a measure of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) relative toother fatty acids in the erythrocyte membrane; in an unselected; regional multicenterobservational study of 982 chest pain patients admitted to the emergency unit; employingblood samples collected at admission.The second purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognostic utility of vitamin D in thesame population.The third purpose of this study is to assess the incremental prognostic value of B-typenatriuretic peptide (BNP) and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP).; BACKGROUND Cardiac troponins are sensitive markers for myocardial injury in ACS and even aminor elevation of cardiac troponins is associated with an increased risk for future adversecoronary events. However; a detectable troponin release occurs only in a part of patientsadmitted with ACS. The clinical outcomes and further prognosis of patients with ACS withabsent TnT release vary widely; and the identification of potential high-risk patients withtroponin negative ACS still remains a major problem in clinical routine. Therefore; the aimof this study is focused on identifying new biomarkers for risk stratification.Omega- 3 Index: The value of the Omega-3 Index as a prognostic marker in the acute coronarysyndromes is still under investigation.Vitamin D deficiency is positively correlated with cardiovascular risk and N-3polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's) may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Vitamin Dcan either be ingested; or created in the skin on exposure to sun; whereas PUFA's are largelyincorporated through the diet. Vitamin D deficiency in humans is increasing and its levelsare influenced by the color of the skin; geographical location; latitude; altitude; seasonand daytime.In addition to Vitamin D; several studies have shown that; N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFA's); also have a positive impact on the cardiovascular system. PUFA's are notsufficiently synthesized in the body and are incorporated through the diet. These essentialfatty acids are found almost exclusively in oily fish; and have been shown to have a positiveimpact on several cardiovascular risk factors.Fish; a source of both Vitamin D and omega-3; is frequently consumed by the costal populationof Norway; and is less preferred by the inland beef-consuming population in NorthernArgentina. The subtropical location and altitude of Salta; Argentina; is associated with ahigher exposure to sun in comparison to the temperate location of Norway. The uptake ofVitamin D in the costal population of Norway may essentially be through the diet; whereas sunexposure may be the essential source of Vitamin D in the Northern Argentinean population.By investigating the correlation between omega-3 and Vitamin D; we may better understand thenutritional impact on Vitamin D and its correlation with n-3 PUFA's.B-type natriuretic peptide: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a counter-regulatory peptidehormone predominantly synthesized in the ventricular myocardium. BNP is released into thecirculation in response to ventricular dilatation and pressure overload; and reflectsventricular wall stress and tissue hypoxia rather than cell injury per se. It is a well knownmarker of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (HF); and it provides prognosticinformation beyond and above left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with anacute coronary syndrome (ACS). This marker of neurohormonal activation and inflammation playsa pivotal role across the spectrum of ACS; including patients with ST-elevation myocardialinfarction (MI) and non ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). Previous studies have demonstrated thatBNP measured in the first days after the onset of symptoms independently predicts mortality;HF; and new MI in this patient population. Elevated natriuretic peptides at presentation havebeen shown to identify patients with ACS who are at higher risk of death and HF; and it addsinformation to that provided by the troponins. However; in a low-risk population theassociation between elevated BNP and survival is attenuated when adjustment is made forechocardiographic variables (in addition to clinical covariates); as shown by Wang andcolleagues. In addition; they did not find any association between baseline BNP and the riskof coronary heart disease (CHD).High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP): C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phasereactant that is produced in response to acute injury; infection or other inflammationstimuli. It is a marker for underlying systemic inflammation and plays an important role inthe initiation and propagation of atherosclerosis and ultimately to plaque rupture and theensuing thrombotic complication. Elevated levels of CRP were first reported in patientshospitalized with NSTE-ACS in the early 1990s. Through the use of appropriate high-sensitiveassays; it has been possible to investigate the relationship between plasma CRP levels thatpreviously were considered to be normal and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Nevertheless; it isstill under debate which markers should be preferred for risk prediction. It has beensuggested that the combined evaluation of BNP and CRP may yield incremental prognosticinformation in the risk stratification of patients with ACS; and their combined use has beenshown to improve long-term risk prediction of mortality in patients with stable CHD. To ourknowledge; there are limited data available that directly compare these two markers in aprospective manner in an unselected patient population presenting to the emergency department(ED) with chest pain. In addition; their role in risk stratification in patients with ACS isstill under evaluation; and therefore additional investigations are necessary.STUDY DESIGN This prospective regional multicenter observational non-invasive trial includes982 men and women admitted with chest pain and potential ACS at nine hopitals in Salta;Argentina between November 2005 and November 2008. Blood samples were collected immediatelyfollowing admission. Patients were stratified according to peak troponin T (TnT) releasefollowing admission; i.e. 1) patients with an admission TnT exceeding 0.01 ng/mL; and 2)patients with a TnT level below 0.01 ng/mL.Assessment of a history of previous MI; angina pectoris (AP); congestive heart failure (CHF);diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension was based on hospital records and personalinterview. Electrocardiographic findings at admission were classified according to thepresence of ST segment changes.Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Survival status; date and cause ofdeath and clinical data were obtained by telephone interview and hospital journal reports at4 predefined time points (30 days; 6; 12 and 24 months) during the two year follow-up period.In case of incapacity to provide information; the general practitioner or nursery home werecontacted for relevant data.

The added informationto current evidence is how reliable and to what extent CTCA can define the actual burden ofdisease and cardiovascular risk.; The Project aims at pooling (retrospectively) a large population of patients with suspectedcoronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography (CTCA)and who were adequately stratified in the first place. Then the investigators will be able toassess the incremental value of CTCA in the stratification of prevalence of disease (nonobstructive/obstructive) and prognosis of patients with suspected CAD. The added informationto current evidence is how reliable and to what extent CTCA can define the actual burden ofdisease and cardiovascular risk.Primary objectives-MACE/Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (i.e. Cardiac Death; Unstable Angina requiringHospitalization; Acute Myocardial Infarction)-Prevalence of cardiovascular risk category shifting based on coronary plaque burdenSecondary objectives-Coronary Revascularizations occurred after CTCA (i.e. PCI/Percutaneous CoronaryRevascularization and CABG/Coronary Artery Bypass Graft)-Prevalence of outliers (i.e. patients lying completely outside the conventional riskstratification; pts with >3 risk factors and no CAD at CTCA and pts with no risk factorsand >5 coronary segments with CAD)Institutional Database will be used as data supply. Data will be anonimyzed and pooled (itwill not be possible to detect patients' identity). For this reason the investigators willno task for patients' Informed Consent.DESIGN The investigators will retrospectively collect data from respective Institutionaldatabases regarding patients who underwent CTCA for suspected CAD in the last 4 years.General Inclusion criteria Only patients with also Calcium Scoreâ‰¥64-slice CT technology (or 16-slice CT technology with >4 year follow-up) Number of patientsof at least 100 with complete clinical file and follow-up Minimum follow-up of 12 months Onlypatients with suspected Coronary Artery DiseaseMETHODS Study design and patient population This is an observational retrospective study(consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria) in patients with suspected coronaryartery disease referred to our Institutions for evaluation by Computed Tomography CoronaryAngiography (CTCA) starting in January 2003. Participating centers will provide data from16-slice CTCA (minimum follow-up >4 years) or superior (i.e. 64-slice CTCA; minimum follow-up12 months). Each center will have to provide at least 200 patients (with complete file forevaluation).Patients are usually referred because of symptoms (chest pain; dyspnoea on exertion) and/orabnormal or equivocal stress test and/or high cardiovascular risk profile. Exclusion criteriaare renal failure (creatinine clearance <60ml/min); known previous reaction to iodinatedcontrast medium and pregnancy; history of Myocardial Infarction; previous revascularization(PCI and/or CABG).All the patients will be assessed by interview and by data collection from clinical databaseof the Institution for presence of cardiovascular risk factors and symptoms. The followingrisk factors will be considered: 1) Hypertension (defined as Arterial Pressure 140/80 mmHg orneed for antihypertensive therapy); 2) Hypercholesterolemia (LDL Cholesterol >130 mg/dl orcurrent treatment with lipid-lowering therapy); 3) Diabetes Mellitus (current need forantidiabetic or insulin therapy); 4) Smoking habit; 5) Obesity (Body Mass Index/BMI> 30); 6)Family history of cardiac disease. Symptoms will be classified as no symptoms; typical chestpain; atypical chest pain; dyspnoea on exertion. The pre-test cardiovascular risk of thepatients will be determined by means of the Morise risk score.Follow-up Follow-up data of all the patients were obtained by outpatient visit and/or phonecontact and/or data collection from clinical database of the Institution. Minimum follow-upwill be 6 months. Hospital/patients' records were screened for the occurrence of clinicalevents to confirm the obtained information. The clinical end-points are: 1) cardiac death; 2)non-fatal acute myocardial infarction; 3) unstable angina requiring hospitalization; 4)percutaneous or surgical revascularization. Cardiac death is defined as death caused by acutemyocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmias. Non-fatal myocardial infarction is definedbased on criteria of typical chest pain; elevated cardiac enzyme levels; and typical changeson the electrocardiogram. Revascularization is defined as percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) with stenting or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). The end point was theoccurrence of one MACE at follow-up.Multislice computed tomography data acquisition All examinations were performed with a16-slice or higher CT system (Multi-vendor). First; a prospectively triggered coronarycalcium CT data set was obtained using standardized CT parameters. Thereafter CTCA wasperformed after the administration of a bolus (60-100ml) non ionic contrast material(Multi-vendor) at flow rate of 4-6ml/s depending on patient status. All injections wereperformed by power injector via an antecubital vein and were followed by 50 ml of salinebolus chase at the same flow rate. A bolus tracking technique was used to determine theinitiation of CT data acquisition. CTCA was performed with the best available parameters;depending on scanner type and generation. The reconstruction slice thickness and incrementwere 0.5-0.75mm and 0.3-0.5mm respectively. Intra-venous beta-blocker (e.g. atenolol 5-10mg)was administered to all patients with a heart rate >65 beats/min and without contraindication(known asthma or bronchospasm; systolic blood pressure <100mmHg). In addition;nitro-glycerine was administered sublingually to all patients; albeit contraindications(known significant aortic stenosis; systolic blood pressure <100mmHg). Patients with atrialfibrillation or frequent premature beats were included in the study. To obtain optimal imagequality; datasets were reconstructed at least at two points of the cardiac cycle using aretrospective ECG gating algorithm (one diastolic cardiac phase usually at -350msec from theR waves and one end-systolic phase at +275msec). In the presence of motion artefacts; as inthe case of cardiac arrhythmias; additional reconstructions were made at different timepoints of the R-R interval. At the time of the study; tube current modulation was not used.The estimated radiation dose would be 5-20mSv. Axial data sets are transferred to a remoteworkstation (Multi-vendor) for post-processing and subsequent evaluation.CTCA data analysis - Coronary Artery Calcium Score The coronary artery calcium (CACS) scorewas assessed with the application of dedicated software (Multi-vendor). Coronary arterycalcium was identified as a dense area in the coronary artery whose attenuation exceeded thethreshold of 130 Hounsfield units (HU). The overall calcium score was calculated according toAgatston score algorithm for each patient.CTCA data analysis - Coronary Artery Atherosclerotic plaque assessment All CTCA angiogramsare evaluated locally by 2 experienced board certified observers. In case of disagreement; ajoint reading was performed and a consensus was reached. Coronary arteries were divided into15-16 segments according to the modified American Heart Association classification and in thecase the intermediate branch was present it was added to the classification. All coronarysegments were considered in the analysis. First; each segment was classified as assessable ornot assessable. All assessable segments were then evaluated for the presence of anyatherosclerotic plaque. Axial images and curved multiplanar reconstructions of the segmentalvasculature were utilized for the assessment. Coronary plaques were defined as describedpreviously as structures of >1mm^2 within and/or adjacent to the coronary artery lumen whichare clearly distinguishable from the vessel lumen and surrounding pericardial tissue.Obstructive coronary plaques were defined as plaques resulting in â‰¥50% luminal narrowing; nonobstructive plaques were defined as plaques that resulted in <50% luminal narrowing. Patientswere classified as belonging to one of three groups based on the CTCA findings: 1) patientswith normal coronary arteries; 2) patients with non obstructive coronary artery disease; and3) patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (presence of at least one plaque â‰¥50%).Statistical analysis Categorical baseline characteristics; expressed as numbers andpercentages; will be compared using the chi-square test. Continuous variables; expressed asmean and standard deviation (SD); will be compared using the 2-tailed t test and analysis ofvariance if normally distributed or by means of the Kruskal-Wallis method if not normallydistributed. A composite end-point of MACE will be used (cardiac death; non-fatal infarction;unstable angina). Cumulative event rates as a function of time were obtained by means of theKaplan-Meier method. Event curves of MACE will be compared using the log-rank test. Coxregression analysis will be used to identify associations between clinical characteristicsand CTCA variables and outcome. Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed toidentify potential predictors. In the multivariate analysis will be included only variableswhich were significant at univariate analysis. Hazard ratios will be calculated with 95%confidence intervals as an estimate of the risk associated with a particular variable.Statistical analyses will be performed using Excel 2007 software (Microsoft; United States);MedCalc software (version 8.0; United States); STATA software (version 10; United States);SPSS software (version 12.0; United States). p values <0.05 will be considered statisticallysignificant.Incremental value of CTCA above CACS will be analyzed. Sub-analysis for the pre-testcardiovascular risk stratification according to the Morise score (low-risk; intermediaterisk; high risk) will be performed.Sample size Based on our experience and data from literature the investigators estimated asample size of 1000 patients. Considering the retrospective nature of the study; it ispossible that at the end the investigators will reach a population >1000 patients which willanyway let the study continue to the expected 2 years duration.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Recruiting,NA,2011-06-28,2011-06-29,2021-01-12,Observational,NA,NA,Coronary Artery Disease|Myocardial Ischemia|Coronary Disease|Atherosclerosis,Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography|Coronary Artery Disease|Prevalence Of Disease|Prognosis|Risk Stratification,MACE/Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events.

For this purpose; a lot of risk prediction models that takedemographic and clinical characteristics into account have been developed. AlthoughFramingham risk score (FRS) is most widely used among multiplr risk prediction models; it hassome limitation for prediction of CVD especially in young adult and women. Recently; coronaryartery calcium score (CACS) has known to be powerful screening method for CVD; however; itcannot detect the noncalcified coronary plaques (NCP); so it does not represent the entirespectrum of atherosclerotic plaques and it also cannot evaluate the degree of stenosis. Onthe contrary; Coronary CT angiography (CCTA)can provide detailed coronary artery anatomy andplaque imaging about the location; burden and characteristics of atherosclerotic plaque perse; which might give additional insight to stratify the risk of future cardiac events andtherapy.In this study; we will evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of subclinical coronaryatherosclerosis on CCTA in asymptomatic population. And we will investiage the follow up datafor major cardiac adverse event such as cardiac death; nonfatal myocardial infarction;unstable angina and revascularization.

The aim of this study is to investigate the alteration ofcomplement C3 in patients with severe abdominal sepsis and evaluate the role of complement C3depletion in prognosis of such patients. The relationship between complement C3 depletion andadaptive immunity is studied meanwhile.; Severe abdominal sepsis remains a significant cause of death in patients undergoingintra-abdominal infection; in despite of recent declines in overall mortality. There is aabundant evidence to suggest complement activation during sepsis. While there is greatinterest in complement by-products in human sepsis; few studies focus on the persistentconsumption of complement components and its role in prognosis of sepsis. Complement C3 isindispensable community pathway for complement activation. In a way; the alteration of C3levels can affect the whole status of complement biological functions.In clinical practice; the severe abdominal sepsis would develop compromised immune functionif the intra-abdominal infection is not well controlled. The down-regulated T- and B-cellimmune responses to sepsis are correlated to the decreased immune defense. To our knowledge;there are few human data that have investigated the relationship between complement depletionand adaptive immunity in severe abdominal sepsis. The investigators hypothesize that thecomplement C3 depletion during sepsis has a stronger association with the down-regulatedadaptive immunity and can be regarded as a essential risk factor to predict the prognosis ofsuch critical illness.The purpose of this prospective study is two-fold. First; the investigators observe; in acohort of patients with severe abdominal sepsis; the levels of complement components andpercentages of T cell subsets after admission to evaluate the relationship between complementsystem and adaptive immunity.

Outcome in patients with GBS has not improved in the last two decades.At present about 10 to 20% of patients remain severely disabled and about 5% die. Oneexplanation for this stagnation is the highly variable clinical course of GBS and the lack ofknowledge about the factors that determine the clinical course in individual patients withGBS. GBS may consist of distinct pathogenic subgroups; in which disease onset and progressionis influenced by different types of preceding infections; anti-neural antibodies and geneticpolymorphisms. Optimal treatment of individual patients may depend on the pathogenesis andclinical severity. Patients with severe forms of GBS may possibly need more intensivetreatment to recover. Patients with a milder course that fully recover after standard therapycould suffer from possibly more side effects of more aggressive forms of treatment. Thiscould only be possible if there are prognostic models that accurately predict the clinicalcourse in individual patients. Ideally such models should be based on clinical and biologicalpredictors that are strongly associated with disease course and known as early as possible inthe acute phase of illness; when treatment with immunomodulatory therapy is most effective.Prognostic models could help to guide selective trials in specific GBS subtypes. Because ofthis it will be possible to treat GBS with more effective and more individual therapy.This study aims to identify clinical and biological determinants and predictors of diseasecourse and outcome in individual patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome; as early as possibleafter onset of disease. This information will be used to understand the diversity in clinicalpresentation and response to treatment of GBS. This information will also be used to developnew prognostic models to predict the clinical course and outcome accurately in individualpatients with GBS.To address these research questions it is required to conduct a prospective study withstandardized collection of clinical data and biomaterials from a large group of well-definedGBS patients during a long follow-up period.

The addition of concurrentchemotherapy and the use of altered fractionation schedules has significantly increasedlocoregional control and overall survival over the last decade however; this has come at thecost of increased acute and late toxicity; preventing further treatment intensification inall patients. If the investigators want to increase the therapeutic index of HNSCC; we needto be able to tailor the treatment more individually to each patient. The project aims atdeveloping a prognostic model for head and neck cancer patients based on the combination ofknown clinical parameters with 1) genetic characteristics of the tumor and 2) parametersderived from diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) obtained before and during treatment. The investigators plan a prospective trial where120 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy willbe included. Prior to treatment biopsy material will be collected for genetic analysis andbefore and during treatment functional MRI with diffusion weighted and dynamic contrastenhanced imaging will be performed. All patients will be followed up multidisciplinaryafterwards with follow-up of tumor status and toxicity.; 1. BACKGROUND AND SETTING1.1. IntroductionConcurrent (chemo-) radiotherapy (CRT) is the current standard of care for patients withlocally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The proximity ofimportant functional structures with the tumour makes treatment however highly complex.While locoregional control rates have improved over the last decade; treatment relatedtoxicity can be severe with xerostomia and dysphagia gravely complicating the patient'squality of life.Furthermore; it becomes increasingly clear that while these tumours can be identical inlocation and basic histology; their response to treatment differs greatly. This impliesthat for a subgroup of patients; equal locoregional control rates could be achievedusing a less intense and consequently less toxic treatment schedule. This in contrast tothe group of patients who develop a locoregional recurrence during follow up; for whomcurrent treatment is apparently insufficient. These patients might benefit from a moreintense treatment schedule; i.e. a higher dose of radiation.These differences in sensitivity to treatment can be explained by variations inbiological; molecular and genetic factors. Clinical parameters alone are insufficientfor response prediction. Identifying the different molecular and genetic factors; wouldhelp us increase the accuracy of response prediction and based on these factors tailorthe treatment more individually to each patient. Therefore we want to develop aprognostic and predictive model incorporating well-defined molecular and imagingparameters which show great promise in response prediction after ionizing radiation.1.2. Genetic and molecular tumour characteristicsThe first parameter we want to investigate further is tumour hypoxia. Hypoxia has beenidentified as a factor that increases tumour aggressiveness and decreasesradiosensitivity. In the past; several techniques have been applied to detectbiologically relevant tumour hypoxia; but none of them are used today in routineclinical practice. Recently; a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based hypoxia classifiergene signature was published by Toustrup et al. This classifier allows us to studybiologically relevant tumour hypoxia and consequently tumour aggressiveness andresistance to ionizing irradiation. This analysis will be performed on biopsies obtainedprior to treatment. Part of this biopsy material will also be stored into our biobank.This will facilitate future research on promising molecular and genetics parameters(such as HPV correlated overexpression of p16 for example) on a well-defined andstructured patient database.1.3. Imaging parametersAside from these important molecular and genetic tumour characteristics; severalfunctional imaging parameters will also be included in our model. In contrast toanatomical imaging; functional imaging modalities provide us with a deeper insight inthe tumour's underlying biological activity and microstructure.Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) can characterize tissues based onthe random displacement of water protons. This displacement can be quantified using theapparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Preliminary studies in HNSCC have demonstrated theprognostic and predictive potential of repetitive DWI early during and after treatment.Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging(DCE-MRI) is a second technique;which shows great promise as an early indicator of response to ionizing radiation. Manymalignant tumors manifest neovascularity or angiogenesis. These processes are howeverflawed and as a result these newly synthesized vessels manifest a high permeability;tortuosity and generally a poor functionality. This might result in poor oxygen supplyto the tumour cells; which may compromise the effectiveness of radiation treatment ofthe tumour. Therefore the vascular properties of a tumour; assessed with DCE-MRI; couldprove a prognostic indicator of its aggressiveness.2. STUDY OBJECTIVES2.1. Primary objectivesThe main objective of this study is to correlate clinical; molecular and radiologicalpredictors with outcome; as defined by locoregional control and disease free survival.In this way we will develop a prognostic/predictive model. The predictive model will beinstrumental in the individualization of treatment ensuring optimized treatment andavoiding under- and overtreatment.2.2. Secondary objectives-We want to get new insights in the tumor biology and microstructure by correlatingimaging and molecular/genetic markers in a well-defined patient population.-We want to validate the different imaging techniques.-We want to make a correlation between hypoxia and other predictive biomarkers inthe future; by storing the tissue obtained in this study in our biobank.3. STUDY DESIGNWe propose to set up a study where we will prospectively include patients with locallyadvanced head and neck cancer who will be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy asdecided after multidisciplinary consultation. An outline of the trial is presented inthe figure below. All patients recognized eligible (non-metastatic locally advanced headand neck squamous cell carcinoma; treated with chemoradiotherapy; karnofsky performancestatus â‰¥ 70% and â‰¥ 18 years old) will be included after written informed consent.Staging with a laryngoscopy; CT of the neck; MRI of the neck and a PET-CT will beroutinely performed.The CRT treatment consists of radiotherapy up to 72 Gy using an acceleratedhyperfractionated schedule. Day 1 and day 22 of the treatment Cisplatin at 100mg/mÂ² willbe administered.Tumour biopsies will be obtained a few days prior to treatment. The hypoxia geneexpression profile will be derived from the tumour material (15 genes on PCR that can beanalyzed individually or as a group through one binary variable).The tissue used for RNA and DNA extraction needs to be flanked by H&E stainingconfirming tumor presence. From the biopsy the two ends will be cut off and fixed inparaffin. This tissue will be stored in the biobank. The middle part of the tissue willbe stored into RNA-later; and will be used in part to extract DNA and RNA.

These two events will be separately scored.<br><br>SUMMARY:The primary and general objective of the clinical introduction of the Standard Follow-upProgram (SFP) as the current standard of care is to improve the quality of radiotherapy forhead and neck cancer patients by reducing radiation-induced side effects without hamperingtreatment efficacy in terms of locoregional tumour control and overall survival and tosystematically evaluate the beneficial effect of newly introduced radiation technology forthis particular group of patients. The clinical introduction of the SFP will allow for asystematic and broad scale quality improvement cycle for head and neck cancer patientstreated with radiotherapy. In fact; this methodology can be considered a kind of qualitycircle for the clinical introduction of new radiation techniques; aiming at continuousefforts for further improvement.; For head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); radiation therapy is one of the mainstaysof therapy either as definitive therapy alone or in combination with systemic therapy orfollowing surgical resection as postoperative treatment. Nowadays there's great attention forpersonalized medicine which aims at offering a patient the treatment that best suits theindividual patient and its tumor characteristics. To apply personalized therapy; we needaccurate outcome prediction models for disease control; treatment related toxicity andquality of life.The main factors used for predictive/prognostic nomograms are clinical factors; likepatient-; tumor- and treatment related factors (1). Standard examples of these include age;gender; co-morbidity; smoking history; hemoglobin levels; tumor site; TNM stage; tumorvolume; HPV-status; and others. For larynx cancer the nomogram was made publicly available onwww.predictcancer.org.However; we anticipate that other factors will contribute to the (improvement of) predictionmodels. These factors may include genomic analysis of tumor specimens; quantitative imageanalysis (radiomics); blood biomarkers; and/or tumor-tissue markers (2).In addition; treatment-related parameters also need to be considered and these not onlyinclude factors like overall treatment time; use of systemic therapy; prescribed radiationdose and fraction dose. With new techniques using EPID dosimetry; it is now possible tomeasure the delivered radiation dose and compare this to the prescribed dose (3;4). Thisoffers the potential to apply Dose Guide RadioTherapy (DGRT); which especially in HNSCC mayhave a large impact; because anatomical changes during fractionated therapy are known tooccur and lead to dose changes to targets and organs at risk (5;6).The final objective of this study is to integrate all potential prognostic factors anddevelop reliable nomograms both for tumor control as well as complications.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2013-11-11,2013-11-18,2021-09-13,Observational [Patient Registry],NA,NA,Head and Neck Neoplasms,Head and neck cancer,overall survival; The overall survival will be calculated from the first day of treatment; either the first day of induction chemotherapy or the first day of radiotherapy in case of concomitant chemoradiation or radiation alone.

The presence of an untreated CTO has been related to adverse clinicalprognosis; both in stable angina and acute myocardial infarction; and is often associatedwith persistent symptomatic angina. Depending on their symptomatic and functional status aswell as anatomical complexity; CTO can be treated by optimal medical therapy only or therapycombined with coronary revascularization.The potential benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in CTO include symptomrelief; improved left ventricular function; and potentially a survival advantage associatedwith success when compared with failed revascularization. Of note; marked advances inendovascular techniques and device technology have resulted in substantial improvements ofprocedural success rates of PCI in CTO.In spite of these advances; the vast majority of patients with CTO are still being managedmedically or referred for coronary bypass surgery rather than PCI. The most common reason fordeferring PCI in patients with CTO appears to be the uncertainty of predicting the proceduraloutcome of percutaneous revascularization. Further barriers to attempting CTO by PCI includethe difficulty of gauging the time required for the procedure and the use of resources.The CT-RECTOR (Computed Tomography REgistry of Chronic Total Occlusion Revascularization)study was designed to evaluate the application of coronary computed tomography angiography(CTA) for the prediction of procedural outcome of PCI in CTO in an international patientpopulation. The main purpose of this multicenter registry is to develop a noninvasiveCTA-based prediction tool (CT-RECTOR Score) for grading CTO suitability for PCI.; Coronary CTA has recently emerged as a valuable noninvasive tool to provide guidance duringpercutaneous treatment of CTO. The main advantages of coronary CTA in characterization of CTOinclude the 3-dimensional visualization of occlusion trajectory and morphology as well as theexact evaluation of calcifications. Despite this; and although prior single-center studiessuggested a potential utility of individual coronary CTA-based CTO characteristics forpredicting PCI; there has been no compiled prediction model for grading CTO suitability forPCI in a large cohort of patients.The CT-RECTOR registry is a retrospective; multicenter observational study of patientsundergoing preprocedural coronary CTA before attempted PCI of CTO between 2007 and 2013. Thestudy was designed to enroll 250 consecutive patients at 4 high-volume cluster sites in 2European countries.

Previous clinical trials have shown their remarkablygood response to rituximab as well as to chemotherapy.The PTLD-1 trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of sequential immunochemotherapy with 4courses of rituximab IV followed by 4 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy. Compared to trials ofrituximab monotherapy in PTLD; median overall survival was extended from 2.4 to 6.5 years.Compared to previous trials of chemotherapy; complications were reduced. In addition; wenoted that those patients who already had a good response to the first four cycles ofrituximab did better overall than those who did not. As a consequence; the PTLD-1/3 trialintroduced risk-stratification in sequential treatment according to the response to the first4 courses of rituximab monotherapy. Those patients with a complete remission went on toreceive four further courses of rituximab whereas those who did not received rituximab andCHOP chemotherapy. Interim results have demonstrated that it is safe to restrict chemotherapytreatment in this manner and thus established the concept of treatment stratification basedon the response to rituximab.The PTLD-2 trial is the next step in the development of this strategy. Compared to thePTLD-1/3 trial; the key difference is the use of subcutaneous instead of intravenousrituximab application. Interim results from an ongoing trial of patients with follicularlymphoma (NCT01200758) have shown that subcutaneous administration results in increased bloodlevels and in non-inferior remission rates. Furthermore; the stratification strategy isrefined based on observations from the previous PTLD-1 and PTLD1/3 trials: Risk groups arenow defined not only based on response to rituximab therapy but also on the internationalprognostic index (IPI; a well-established lymphoma risk score) and the transplanted organ.The major advantage of this new stratification is an extended low-risk group that is eligiblefor subcutaneous rituximab monotherapy: Patients with a low risk of disease progression;defined as those who achieve a complete remission after the first four courses ofsubcutaneous rituximab monotherapy and those with an IPI of 0 to 2 who achieve a partialremission at interim staging; will go on with rituximab monotherapy. Patients with high IPIwho achieve a partial remission; patients with stable disease at interim staging andnon-thoracic transplant recipients with progressive disease at interim staging will beconsidered high risk. These patients will go on with 4 cycles of rituximab plus CHOPchemotherapy similar to the PTLD-1/3 protocol. Thoracic transplant recipients refractory torituximab will be considered very high risk and will go on with rituximab subcutaneous plusalternating chemotherapy with CHOP and DHAOx.The trial hypothesis is that the new protocol will improve the event-free survival; a measureintegrating unfavorable events such as death; disease progression and treatmentcomplications; particularly infections; in the low risk-group compared to the results of thePTLD-1 trial. In very high-risk patients data from the PTLD-1 and PTLD-1/3 trial have shownthat the current treatment is not sufficient to control the disease. Death due to diseaseprogression was observed in more than 80% of patients. Here; rituximab combined withalternating chemotherapy cycles of CHOP and DHAOx (+GCSF) may increase treatment efficacywith an acceptable toxicity profile.In summary; the PTLD-2 trials tests if the substitution of subcutaneous for intravenousrituximab and an updated stratification strategy that deescalates treatment for those at lowrisk and escalates treatment for those at very high risk can further improve the overallefficacy and safety of PTLD therapy.; ,TRUE,prognostic,development,Active; not recruiting,NA,2014-01-20,2014-01-22,2020-07-20,Interventional,Non-Randomized,Treatment,Lymphoproliferative Disorders|Cytarabine|Prednisone|Cyclophosphamide|Rituximab|Oxaliplatin|Doxorubicin|Liposomal doxorubicin|Vincristine,PTLD|CD20-positive|solid organ transplantation,Event free survival (EFS) of low-risk patients in the intention to treat population with following definitions for low-risk and event:; Time from start of treatment to event with following definitions for low-risk and event:Low-risk:all patients in complete remission at interim staging; i.e. 4 weeks after the four weekly courses of rituximab SC monotherapyall patients in partial remission at interim staging with an initial international prognostic index (IPI) of 0;1 or 2Events:any grade III or IV infection during the treatment periodtreatment discontinuation from any reasondisease progression at any timedeath from any reason,Overall survival Time to progression Progression-free survival Response at interim staging Response after full treatment Duration of response Treatment-related mortality; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,22,1,2014,blah,1234,1234,1234

No studies have evaluated predictive kinetics of plasmabiomarkers and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) polymorphisms in a broadpopulation of critically ill patients or as an adjunct to clinical prediction scores.The main objective of the investigators study is to evaluate the predictive values of plasmasoluble RAGE levels for the onset of ARDS in a high risk population of patients admitted tothe intensive care unit (ICU).One of the investigators goals is to improve early identification of patients at risk forARDS in order to better implement preventive stategies prior to ARDS development.The primary outcome is the occurrence of ARDS during the first week after admission to theICU.; BACKGROUND :ARDS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Only fewpharmacological treatments are available; with limited evidence of efficacy.The development of efficient preventive stategies is limited by the investigators inabilityto predict which patients are likely to develop ARDS. The Lung Injury predicition Score(LIPS) has been developed to identify patients at high risk for ARDS; but its predictivevalue remains limited.The receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) is now identified as a marker ofalveolar type I cell injury. RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that acts asa multiligand receptor which is involved in propagating inflammatory responses. Plasma levelsof sRAGE are correlated with clinical and radiologic severity in ARDS patients.The investigators main objective is to assess the predictive values of plasma sRAGE andesRAGE levels; as well as their evolution over the first 24 hours after admission; for theonset of ARDS in high risk patients.The secondary objectives are to :-to evaluate the predictive value of RAGE polymorphisms (_429 T/C; _374 T/A; 2184 A/G;Gly82Ser) for the onset of ARDS-to evaluate the predictive value of maximal plasma levels of RAGE soluble forms for theonset of ARDS-to test the relationship between RAGE polymorphisms and plasma sRAGE and esRAGE levels-to test whether serial sRAGE measurements would improve the discrimination of the LIPScore or not-to evaluate the prognostic value of plasma levels of RAGE soluble forms for : durationof mechanical ventilation; length of stay in the ICU and 30-day mortality.DESIGN NARRATIVE :The purpose of this prospective observational study is to test the values of RAGEpolymorphism and soluble forms plasma levels for ARDS prediction in high risk ICU patients,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2014-02-21,2014-02-25,2020-05-09,Observational,NA,NA,Respiratory Distress Syndrome|Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Newborn|Acute Lung Injury,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)|Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)|Soluble RAGE (sRAGE)|Gene polymorphisms|Biomarker,development of ARDS; The development of ARDS; based on Berlin definition criteria; during the first week after admission to the ICU,Plasma sRAGE and esRAGE levels Plasma sRAGE and esRAGE levels Evolution of plasma sRAGE levels Maximal plasma levels of sRAGE and esRAGE Development of ARDS Total duration of mechanical ventilation Length of stay in ICU; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,25,2,2014,blah,1234,1234,1234

There is growing evidence that more aggressivetreatment regimens improve tumour control and survival. However; intensified treatment is atthe expense of increased toxicity; in particular severe acute mucositis. In addition and ofincreasing importance; late and irreversible treatment-related side effects; includingxerostomia and swallowing dysfunction; occur in a considerable proportion of patients andnegatively affect quality of life.High-risk human papilloma virus (HPV); specifically HPV type-16; is implicated as thecausative factor in a proportion of HNC; especially those of the oropharynx. HPV-relatedcancers respond well to chemoradiotherapy compared to HNC related to tobacco and alcohol.Furthermore; the incidence of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer is rising in Westerncountries. Given the significant toxicity associated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy;subsets of patients could be managed differently.The first objective of the project is to develop predictive models for radiation-induceddysphagia and xerostomia in HNC patients. Clinical characteristics; treatment parameters;dose-volume effects on healthy tissues and whole-genome genetic data will be considered. Thesecond objective of the project is to study the prognostic value of HPV status together witha panel of tumour biomarkers in oropharyngeal cancer patients.

Patients will undergo a blood test to assess their hematocrit prior to surgery on the day of RALRP; and again on post operative day 1 to determine the change in the hematocrit following surgery. Patients who receive PAE will undergo MRIs before PAE and 6 weeks after PAE to assess any change in prostate volume following the embolization procedure. Requirement for blood transfusion during the prostatectomy procedure will be assessed in all patients. The surgeon performing the prostatectomy will determine whether or not patients require blood transfusions.   Histopathology examination post RALRP will be used to determine if the prostatectomy procedure succeeded in removing the entire cancer. Biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer will be determined by PSA levels 1 year following the RALRP procedure. Return to continence following the RALRP procedure will be determined by the pad weight test; conducted at each follow-up visit until the patient is continent. Any adverse event occurring between the date of RALRP and 1 year of follow-up that the investigators determine to be related to the RALRP procedure will be assessed. Any adverse event occurring between the date of PAE and 1 year of follow-up that the investigators determine to be related to the PAE procedure will be assessed.

The scores can range 6 to 75 Patients who undergo PAE will have blood tests to determine the change in their PSA levels between baseline and 6 weeks post PAE. The Gleason Score prostate Cancer Grading and Prognostic scoring system will be used to determine the histologic changes in the prostate tumor. Since prostate tumors are often made up of cancerous cells that have different grades; two grades are assigned to each patient. A primary grade is given to describe the cells that make up the largest area of the tumor and a secondary grade is given to describe the cells of the next largest area. The sums of the scores will be evaluated. The Gleason Score sum will range from 1 - 10; with the higher score indicating a more advanced neoplasm.<br><br>SUMMARY:The purpose of this study is to determine whether pre-operative prostate artery embolization(PAE) reduces intra-operative blood loss and improves surgical outcomes among prostate cancerpatients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP).; Duration of study:This study will enroll 20 patients; with a target enrollment period of 18 months.

The scores can range 6 to 75 Patients who undergo PAE will have blood tests to determine the change in their PSA levels between baseline and 6 weeks post PAE. The Gleason Score prostate Cancer Grading and Prognostic scoring system will be used to determine the histologic changes in the prostate tumor. Since prostate tumors are often made up of cancerous cells that have different grades; two grades are assigned to each patient. A primary grade is given to describe the cells that make up the largest area of the tumor and a secondary grade is given to describe the cells of the next largest area. The sums of the scores will be evaluated. The Gleason Score sum will range from 1 - 10; with the higher score indicating a more advanced neoplasm.,1234,1234,1234,1234,25,6,2014,blah,1234,1234,1234

Atherosclerosis measuresincluding plaque volume and adverse plaque features have prognostic value. Novel techniqueshave been developed for assessing carotid; coronary; and femoral atherosclerosis usingmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods that are rapid and reproducible; have improvedspatial resolution; and do not require contrast media; making atherosclerosis assessment inmultiple vascular beds feasible during a single MRI session. This pilot research will providepreliminary data to develop an innovative global atherosclerosis measure including carotid;coronary; and femoral vascular beds; for assessing cardiovascular risk and for monitoringatherosclerosis response to therapy. 20 participants will be recruited in one year.; There are up to 2 study visits in this study.During the first visit; the investigators will obtain non-contrast MRI (carotid; coronary;and femoral) in 20 subjects with known coronary atherosclerosis but varying degrees of CVDrisk.1. 5 asymptomatic subjects with lower CVD risk (recent coronary artery calcium score [CACS]10-299)2. 5 asymptomatic subjects with higher CVD risk (CACS 300-1000)3. 5 subjects with known coronary atherosclerosis and stable angina4. 5 subjects with known atherosclerosis and recent acute myocardial infarctionThe investigators will measure plaque volume and assess adverse plaque features (intra-plaquehemorrhage; positive remodeling; lesion eccentricity) in the three vascular beds.Eight of these subjects with evidence of large plaque burden by MRI will be asked to returnfor a simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET)-MRI imaging with 18F-sodium fluoride(18F-NaF) of their carotid; coronary; and femoral arteries; in which 18F-NaF uptake in plaquewill represent micro-calcifications; which is associated with high-risk plaque.In all 20 subjects; the investigators will also measure the following biomarkers which havebeen shown to be useful for CVD risk assessment of atherosclerosis: LDL; HDL; lipoprotein(a);apolipoprotein B/A-1 ratio; hemoglobin A1c; adiponectin; and highly sensitive C-reactiveprotein. The investigators will also calculate their estimated 10-year and lifetimeatherosclerotic CVD risk (American Heart Association); Framingham 10-year CVD risk; andReynolds 10-year CVD risk scores.We aim to obtain the second scan within 3 months of the first visit; thus; the subjects willparticipate in the study for approximately 3 months.All the procedures are research-related.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate factors predicting poor outcomewith special emphasis on the impact of respiratory failure on mortality in elderly patientswith isolated severe TBI.All elderly patients (age â‰¥ 65 years) with isolated severe head injury; admitted to thisLevel I trauma center; during a period of 16 years (from January 1992 to December 2008) wereidentified from the trauma registry. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used toidentify risk factors for a poor prognosis and outcome.The logistic regression found the following variables influencing the mortality: respiratoryfailure (p<0.0005; <br><br>OR: 9.369); pupillary response (p<0.0212; <br><br>OR: 3.393) and ISS score(p<0.0001; <br><br>OR:1.179).

Therapeutichypothermia to 33 degrees celsius is now standard treatment of comatose cardiac arrestpatients. The investigators are challenged in our attempt to predict outcome of thesepatients by both low body temperature in itself and the sedative and relaxing drugs used tokeep the patient in a coma.This study is a substudy in a large international multicenter randomized trial thatinvestigates the possible benefit of 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia versus todaysstandard of 24 hours.In this substudy the investigators will approach early prediction of neurological outcomeusing a combination of new examinations backed up by well established ones to engage thischallenge from different angles and find a battery of combined examinations; that togetherwill enable us to accurately predict outcome at an earlier stage.Our examinations have been chosen from the three fields of neurophysiology; biochemistry andneurology and consist of electroencephalography (EEG); somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP);biomarkers and clinical examinations such as brain stem reflexes chosen for their prognosticreliability.; Neurological prognostication of patients in therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrestBackground: In Denmark; approximately 3000 people suffer from cardiac arrest (CA) each year.After CA with no blood flow for more than five minutes; cerebral ischemia; free radicalsalong with other mediators creates chemical cascades during reperfusion that result incerebral injury and often severe neurologic impairment.Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has become standard treatment of comatose CA patients and thishas led to new challenges in the area of prognostication; because both the low temperature initself and the sedative and relaxing drugs used to keep the patient in a coma; affect theexaminations performed by the clinician.This calls for a reevaluation of the existing prognostic examinations and the invention andimplementation of new ones.A new awareness towards a prognostic model involving several different modalities includingSSEP; EEG; biomarkers and clinical examinations is thus awakening.The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of EEG; SSEP; four biomarkers and five clinicalexaminations and observations. We will evaluate our patients using the Glasgow-PittsburghCerebral Performance Categories (CPC).EEG The EEG analysis is today a qualitative analysis based on the assessment of a trainedspecialist. New methods of EEG analysis are based on digital quantitative analyses andtherefore less sensitive to interpersonal differences and the uncertainty of subjectiveassessments.EEG reactivity is the observed change in EEG linked to a stimulation (fx noxious or auditory)and is a promising predictor of outcome concerning CA patient with anoxic coma (1; 9). Inthis study we will use power-spectral analyses in the assessment of EEG reactivity andinvestigate the prognostic value of power analyses in the four frequency bands delta; theta;alpha and beta.Certain EEG-patterns; the malignant patterns; are predictors of bad neurological outcome:1. burst-suppression pattern with discharges of epileptiform activity. (1).2. Generalized suppression (17).3. Isoelectric EEG pattern (17).4. Electroencephalographic status epilepticus (ESE) on a flat background.Hypotheses:1. It is possible to measure reactivity quantitatively in the EEG using power spectrumanalyses and it can be correlated to outcome after 6 months using the CPC scaledichotomized in good (CPC 1-2) and poor (CPC 3-5) outcome.2. EEG has the same predictive value for good and bad outcome in the 48h group compared tothe 24h group using the dichotomized CPC-scale at 6 months.<br><br>SSEP: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials is an examination where the median nerve is stimulatedand cortical response (N20) is assessed. Bilateral absence of the N20 component of a SSEP is;with one exception; invariably associated with bad outcome; CPC 4-5 (1; 2; 7). SSEP maintainsits high predictive value for bad outcome during hypothermia (7; 15) and only one case isdescribed where a patient has regained the N20 response after an initial bilaterally absentresponse measured after 24 hours of hypothermia (106).SSEP is a more hardy examination than the EEG concerning medication and metabolic imbalancesand therefore more prognostically reliable when the response is absent (1).Hypothesis: The predictive value of bilaterally absence of SEP response for death orpermanent vegetative state (CPC4-5) is 100% at 24; 48 and 72 hours in both groups (24h and48h hypothermia).Neurological examination: The brainstem is more resistant to hypoxia than the cerebral cortexwhich is why an absence of brainstem reflexes is a good predictor of bad outcome in comatosepatients. Several studies have shown that presence of myoclonias or seizures and absence ofcorneal-; light- and oculocephalic reflexes along with absence of motor response to noxiousstimulation is strongly associated with severe neurological deficits; permanent vegetativestate or death after CA (1; 12; 15). Our aim is to validate the use of these neurologicalexaminations in prolonged hypothermia of 48 hours and to investigate the difference inincidences in the two groups.Hypothesis: There is a higher incidence of absent brainstem reflexes in the 24h groupcompared to the 48h group evaluated at 72 hours.Biochemical markers:Specific biochemical markers have been demonstrated to have better predictive value than manyclinical examinations in prediction of poor outcome in patients who remain unconscious aftercardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Especially neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S-100B havebeen used in prognostication of the comatose CA patient (3; 4; 8; 74; 14). Cut-off valueswith a predictive value for bad outcome of 100% have been suggested; but because of the smallnumber of patients in most studies and failure to agree on which biochemical marker is thebest; new studies including NSE and S-100B along with testing of new biochemical markers areneeded. In this study we wish to compare the two new biochemical markers Copeptin andNT-proBNP with NSE and S-100B.Copeptin is released in response to stress and is a sensitive and stable surrogate marker forarginine vasopressin release. Measurement of copeptin levels has been shown to be promisingas a prognostic marker in patients with CA and therapeutic hypothermia (16).B-type Natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac neurohormone synthesized in the ventricularmyocardium and secreted as a response to ventricular expansion and pressure overload (11).The BNP level on arrival at the emergency room has been shown to be significantly higheramong patients who die of post-resuscitation syndrome; which is when reperfusion of ischemictissue occurs and cytokines and endotoxines are spread throughout the organism resulting in adrop in cardiac output and cerebral blood flow. The ability of BNP to predict the degree ofpost-resuscitation syndrome therefore makes it a promising neurologic biochemical marker (5).NSE is released because of neuronal damage and impairment of the blood-brain barrierintegrity can be detected by the release of NSE into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and eventuallyinto the blood. Increases in CSF and serum NSE levels have been reported after stroke; braininjury; and CA (80). When used with GCS and SEP; NSE has been demonstrated to augment thepredictive value for neurological outcome (8).Protein S100 beta (S100B) is expressed mainly in human astroglial cells and is a surrogatemarker for neuronal damage (13). S-100B rises to its peak-concentration quickly after the CAthus; constant elevation of S100B level in serum reflects its continuous release from damagedtissue and predicts bad outcome (13). S-100B serves as a prognostic predictor within 24 hoursafter CA; and thus at an earlier stage than other factors like NSE (4).Our aim is to investigate the new prognostic markers Copeptin and NT-proBNP compared to NSEand S-100B in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after CA.Hypotheses:1. 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia reduces the total release of NSE and S-100B comparedto 24 hours measured as area under the curve from 24 to 72 hours.2. The total release of NT-proBNP and Copeptin measured as area under the curve (AUC) issignificantly correlated to neurological outcome (dichotomized CPC score) after 6months.3. To find a cut-off-value for copeptin and NT-proBNP from samples taken at arrival to thehospital that can predict good (CPC1-2) or bad (CPC 3-5) outcome with a false positiverate of 0%.Materials and methods: EEG and SEP is performed on patients at 1: 12-24h after reaching oftarget temperature (T0; 33 degrees celsius); 2: 36-48h and 3: 72-96h after T0 only oncomatose patients. During the EEG recording three sequences of 30 seconds with noxiousstimulation are marked and will be used later in the quantitative power-spectral analysis toassess reactivity. All EEG's are assessed by a neurophysiologist as soon after the recordingas possible in order to see if ESE is present and if so; the treating physician will benotified at once. The final interpretation of the EEG will be conducted blinded at a laterstage.When analysing the EEG we will catalog benign and malignant patterns partly by usingRossettis (9) simple and operational method and assessing the following parameters:Reactivity to noxious stimulation; continuous background activity and ESE.After 6 months our patients will be categorized with the Glasgow-Pittsburgh CerebralPerformance categories (CPC); in which 1 = good recovery; 2 = moderate disability; 3 = severedisability with dependency for daily-life activity; 4 = vegetative state; and 5 = death.<br><br>SEP: Cortical N20 responses of median nerve SEPs are recorded with standard procedures duringhypothermia. SEP is performed maximum 3 times on each patient as described above. Recordingsare assessed by a neurophysiologist and documented as ''absent'' (bilaterally absent corticalN20 responses after left and right median nerve stimulation; in the presence of a cervicalpotential); ''present'' (cortical N20 response present on at least 1 side); or''undeterminable'' (technically insufficient recording). Undeterminable SEP results areconsidered as presentThe chosen examinations and analyses; apart from power-spectral analysis; are well knownstandard examinations and are performed routinely in hospitals all over the world. EEG andSEP are performed by medical student Kristoffer NÃ¸hr and physician Christophe Duez. Theinterpretation is done by a neurophysiologist and Christophe Duez will participateincreasingly.Biochemical markers: NT-proBNP; NSE; S-100B and Copeptin are all taken at hospital admission;24h; 48h and 72h. NT-proBNP is furthermore taken at 96h.Blinding: EEG is blinded to the treating physician unless ESE is present. All primary SEP areblinded to the treating physician. If SEP is performed at 72h it is unblinded. Allbiochemical markers are blinded.Statistical analysis: The QEEG study is a study of a new method in the context of CA and datais therefore not available for statistical analysis. If there is no difference in outcomebetween the 24h and the 48h group we will pool our data and if not we will analyse each groupseparately.The aim of the study on clinical neurological examinations; classical EEG and biochemicalsamples will be to generate new hypotheses as our power assessments are not strong enoughwhen we assess each examination one by one. We still believe however that the examinationsare highly relevant when investigating the additive effect of a multimodal examination andnot many studies have investigated such an important body of examinations within the samestudy. Furthermore we have no data of this kind on patients treated with prolongedhypothermia of 48 hours since it has never been done in a randomized trial.It will be possible to enrol 100 patients in 2 years in the study based on the patient flowof Aarhus University Hospital and we believe that 50 patients in either group will besufficient for a basic validation of well established examinations as well as new ones and toform a basis for generating new hypotheses.Prognostic studies of this kind have not been performed previously in Denmark and we see aunique opportunity in this patient group to create a basis for new studies in the area ofneuro-prognostics in Emergency Medicine and Intensive Care.This protocol is written with biostatistical assistance.Perspective: The aim of this study is to contribute to the understanding of how a longerperiod of therapeutic hypothermia affects some of the examinations used in neurologicalprognostic after CA.In the future we expect EEG; SEP clinical examination and biochemical markers to become amore integrated part of a faster and more precise neurologic prognostication to guide thephysician in his decisions concerning discontinuation of intensive therapy. This will be ofbenefit on many levels because financial implications of caring for patients in a vegetativestate or prolonged impaired consciousness are substantial; family members yearn to know whatfunctional outcome they can expect from their loved ones and maybe most important; thepatients themselves can be spared suffering and unfruitful continuation of therapy.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Completed,NA,2015-03-02,2015-03-18,2017-05-01,Interventional,Randomized,Diagnostic,Heart Arrest|Hypothermia,NA,Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) after 6 months; To evaluate neurologic recovery using the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) 6 months after cardiac arrest.

Itwill test whether an intervention that targets communication deficiencies can alter EOLoutcomes and achieve the goal of matching patient preferences with terminal treatments.Specific Aims:1. To determine whether SDM-RSC impacts the use of hospice services; location of death; andEOL planning. The RSC intervention will be employed at the HD clinics with patients whoare in the highest quintile of mortality.Hypothesis: SDM-RSC will increase a) hospice use; b) deaths at home (vs. ininstitutions); and c) completion of advance directives.2. To determine the effect of SDM- RSC on quality of life/death and caregiver satisfactionwith patient care in the last week of life. Validated instruments reflecting values andpriorities of patient and caregiver will be collected by interviewers.Hypothesis: SDM-RSC will significantly improve quality of life/death while also increasingcaregiver satisfaction.The proposed work addresses recommendations by the Renal Physician's Association for EOL careand the Institute of Medicine for patient-centered healthcare. The novel communicationintervention is relevant to not only ESRD but also other high-mortality disorders.Scope of the Problem:A match between patient goals and the care received should be the gold standard for qualitymedical management. Meaningful end-of-life (EOL) conversations are associated with increasedhospice referral; less aggressive and expensive medical treatment; and improved satisfactionon the part of families. However; a survey of ESRD patients reported less than 10% having aconversation about any EOL issues with their nephrologist in the previous year; and more than90% endorsed that none of their physicians had ever discussed how much time they had to live.It is not known whether an intervention that targets deficiencies in communication andterminal care planning can improve EOL outcomes. This is an area that has been neglected inESRD research; yet should have tremendous importance to patients; families; andpolicy-makers.Over 600;000 Americans have ESRD at a cost to society of more than $42 billion a year; andpatients over the age of 75 constitute the fastest growing segment of the ESRD population inthe United States. Up to one-third of these elderly patients have four or more comorbidchronic health conditions; and hemodialysis (HD) does not always substantially prolong theirlives. This year; Wong and associates reported that 49% of elderly long-term HD patientsspent time in an ICU in their final month of life; compared with 24% of cancer patients;suggesting intensity of care at the EOL is substantially higher in ESRD than that received byother Medicare beneficiaries with life-limiting illnesses. According to analyses from theUnited States Renal Data System; these decisions may have important economic ramifications.This figure demonstrates that the costs of care in the last week of life for those usinghospice and withdrawing from dialysis was approximately half the cost of those who didneither. In light of the substantial prevalence of symptoms; costs; and high mortality rates;it is time to reconsider the care; and especially the EOL care; offered to the ESRDpopulation with advancing age.Communication of prognosis is a key step in EOL planning; but occurs infrequently orextremely late in the dying process among patients with ESRD. Most ESRD patients want tolearn about EOL issues; and according to Davison; the most valued components are beinginformed about prognosis; treatment options (including withdrawal from dialysis) and planningfor death. In two studies; 95% and 97% of patients with ESRD preferred to be givenlife-expectancy information-even if their prognosis was poor-and patients specifically wantedtheir physician to disclose this information without prompting. Nevertheless; nephrologistsand dialysis staff infrequently discuss EOL issues with patients and families; although theyrepeatedly face difficult determinations about treatment options; including whether todiscontinue renal replacement therapies or to consider referral for hospice services. Despitenational guidelines and an explicit recommendation by the Renal Physicians Association andAmerican Society of Nephrology; patients and their family members or surrogate decisionmakers are often not provided with available information. This may help explain why onlyone-in-five dying dialysis patients currently receive hospice care-about half that ofnational figures for overall deaths in the United States and one-fourth that of people dyingfrom cancer.Both uncertainty regarding individual prognosis and a lack of training in communicating haslimited EOL discussions between nephrologists and ESRD patients. Instruments to identifyindividuals undergoing maintenance HD who are at highest risk for death have only recentlybeen shown to be reliable predictive models for clinical use. Integrated prognostic modelsnow take into account laboratory values; comorbidities; changes in comorbidity score overtime; functional status/fragility; quality of life (QOL); and sometimes either the patient'sor clinician's prediction of survival. Drs. Cohen and Germain have developed a practical andreliable instrument that is available online (http://touchcalc.com/calculators/sq); as a freeapplication for mobile devices and it is being increasingly cited for its potential value inthe literature. In addition to the barriers of providing a reliable prognosis; communicationhas been highlighted as a barrier in a qualitative study of elderly ESRD patients andnephrologists.Communication of prognosis may be an essential ingredient in the acceptance of life-limitingconditions; completion of advance directives; do-not-resuscitate orders; and the delineationof goals of care. However; nephrologists and dialysis staff have lacked training tomeaningfully participate in these complex but much needed conversations. In recent years;guidelines have become available to assist medical personnel in communicating 'bad news' andintroducing hospice and other EOL resources to patients and families in an honest andcompassionate manner. Patients who talk with their physicians about approaching death aremore satisfied with care than those who do not; and they also frequently request deaths takeplace at home. These results are consistent with other studies; suggesting that EOLcommunication between patients and physicians is associated with better outcomes; lessexpensive medical care; and decreased anxiety and depression on the part of the bereavedsurvivors.We have identified a major barrier in the management of dialysis patients: the dearth ofcommunication between staff and patients about prognosis and EOL considerations. Withoutthese conversations; this population will continue to receive overly demanding and expensivetreatments; infrequent referrals for hospice services; and a diminished quality of life anddeath. The extensive preliminary work preceding this study; which began with focus groupsinvolving patients and families; has allowed us to develop and validate an accurateprognostic instrument for the identification of HD patients with poor short-term survivalexpectancy. The multimodal SDM-RSC intervention takes advantage of the existinginterdisciplinary team approach that is the bedrock of HD practice; and it empowers thesocial worker to engage in EOL communication with the patients and their loved ones. TheSDM-RSC intervention is designed to be practical; adaptable to existing staff; and easilyreplicated in dialysis facilities throughout the country. Additional involvement ofpatient-partners from two distinct sections of the country will greatly improve the protocol.Renal supportive care holds the promise of becoming an increasingly important and desirableaspect of patient-centered care in ESRD. The principal elements of SDM-RSC include:identification of high-mortality patients; initiating discussions with them and families;sharing decision-making and advance care planning to establish agreed level of care; and whenappropriate changing the emphasis from curative to palliative treatments; such as withdrawalof dialysis and referral for hospice services. This study intends to challenge the currentparadigm of EOL care of ESRD patients and establish whether delivery of prognosticinformation; encouragement of advance directives; and sensitive discussion of terminaltreatment options; e.g. hospice services; by nephrologists and dialysis social workers; cantogether meaningfully alter the last remaining portion of patient lives and the care theyreceive. The trial will confront the issue of overuse-when an appropriate service; e.g. HD;continues to be provided under circumstances in which the potential for harm may exceed thepossible benefit. Furthermore; the proposed trial may significantly improve the QOL ofpatients and provide the opportunity for higher quality care.Brief Overview of SDM-RSC Study Design:The study utilizes a prospective intervention period and a retrospective control period atthe same dialysis units; in order to balance efficacy; power; and accuracy. The interventionwill be implemented at the unit level and is intended to impact not only the specificpatients enrolled in the study but also other patients receiving care in these units. Thedesign avoids the contamination effect and inadvertent cross-overs that would be present withan individual participant randomization design. Because we expect perceptions and practicesto be changed among care providers other designs; e.g. cross-over designs; would also beunusable. Cluster randomization may also not be practical given the variation between unitsin practice patterns and logistics involved in conducting a study with a sufficient number ofdialysis to maintain internal validity. The design may be open to potential selection biasand secular trends. Adjustments for these are discussed in the data analysis section.This study will test whether the SDM-RSC intervention compared to usual care improves EOLcare; including: increased hospice use; enhanced EOL planning; and improved patient andcaregiver satisfaction. The multi-modal SDM-RSC intervention communicates prognosis in aface-to-face encounter; uses an algorithm-based social work intervention; and provideshospice outreach. This study will be recruiting subjects from 16 dialysis units associatedwith 2 clinical centers-Baystate-Tufts (8); University of New Mexico (8). The study samplewill be selected using a validated prognostic tool to enrich the pool of patients who have ahigh risk of mortality and are most likely to benefit from the SDM-RSC intervention.

Yet endorsement of lung cancer screening has not been universal because ofoutstanding concerns which need to be addressed. Our study will aim to screen at riskAlbertans for lung cancer with LDCT scan at baseline; year 1 and year 2 while attempting tofill some knowledge gaps on this topic.; Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in North America and in the world. The vastmajority of lung cancers are associated with cigarette smoking. Lung cancer incidence andmortality rates are similar because lung cancer is a highly fatal disease. Unfortunately; themajority of lung cancers are detected at an advanced stage when they have a very poorprognosis. A substantial amount of data has been reported on low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) screening. The results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed a 20%reduction in mortality from lung cancer with LDCT screening in addition to a 6.7% decrease inall-cause mortality; the first ever screening intervention to demonstrate an improvement inthis latter outcome. Yet endorsement of lung cancer screening has not been universal.Although the NLST results are encouraging; more investigation is needed.The objectives of this study are to prospectively compare the performance of a lung cancerrisk prediction model (RPM) vs. NLST criteria to inform optimal inclusion criteria for aclinical screening program; to prospectively compare a novel screening based nodulemalignancy probability calculation which has been developed in the Pan-Canadian EarlyDetection of Lung Cancer study vs. NLST criteria; to complete a randomized controlled trialas a substudy comparing an intensive tobacco cessation counseling program to a usual care armfor subjects with ongoing tobacco use; to perform a cost analysis evaluating the incrementalcosts associated with LDCT screening for lung cancer compared to no screening; to determinethe average cost associated with incidental findings; false positive findings and lungcancers found during the screening period; and to compare cost implications of both screeningenrollment criteria.The backbone of this research project will be the screening of at risk individuals for lungcancer with LDCT scan.

Secondaryanalyses demonstrate the prognostic significance of troponin release. The absence of suchrelease has been associated with less risk. Whether measurement of high sensitivity TnT mayenable emergency physicians to better risk stratify acute heart failure patients remains tobe determined. This study will help us to better understand the prognostic value of absent orlow hsTnT values in the emergency department setting. In addition; we will also test theSTRATIFY decision rule; a risk score.; Hospitalization for acute heart failure (AHF) results in a high rate of post-dischargemortality and re-admissions; as well as high financial costs. Reducing 30-day re-admissionsafter AHF hospitalization is a major national quality goal intended to both improve patientoutcomes and reduce costs.Approximately 85% of emergency department (ED) patients with AHF are hospitalized; and800;000 of the 1;000;000 hospitalizations for HF originate from the ED; highlighting thecritical role of the ED. Even a single digit percentage (i.e. 5%) decrease in the number ofAHF admissions would equate to an estimated 40;000 fewer hospitalizations.Why are so many AHF patients hospitalized? AHF patients have a high post-discharge eventrate. Emergency physicians have a low risk tolerance. When both are combined; most patientsare admitted. The absence of risk scores for the ED setting compounds the problem. Most riskscores were developed in the hospital. As hospitalization may affect the outcomes ofpatients; whether these risk scores apply to the ED setting is unknown. As a result; whichpatients are at lower risk in the ED has not been well-studied. Further; absence of high-riskfeatures does not necessarily equal absolute low morbidity or mortality; though such patientsare likely at lower risk. In the absence of a risk score; clinical judgment is a poorsubstitute and often fails to identify patients at high risk; such that those discharged fromthe ED may be at equal or greater risk for death than hospitalized patients. Thus; thedifficulty of identifying low risk; combined with the inherent high morbidity and mortalityof AHF; leads to a disproportionate number of hospitalizations.Over a decade ago; the Agency for Healthcare Research and Policy Guidelines suggested that upto 50% of AHF patients were potential candidates for ED discharge or observation unitmanagement. Furthermore; nearly half of all patients hospitalized for AHF present withlower-risk features such as high blood pressure (> 140mmHg) and a BNP < 1000 pg/mL. If low orlower risk ED patients with HF could be accurately identified; perhaps a greater proportionof patients with AHF could be safely discharged or observed briefly prior to discharge.Study Rationale: With this pilot study; we will generate the necessary and sufficient pilotdata to inform the design of a definitive trial to test whether identification of low riskacute heart failure (AHF) patients with negative serial high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT)in the ED may be safely discharged home or observed briefly in observation status.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2015-10-28,2015-10-30,2018-06-01,Observational,NA,NA,Heart Failure,Acute Cardiac Insufficiency|Acute Heart Failure,A composite of all cause mortality and re-hospitalization; including ED re-visits; Have increased the follow up from 30 to 90 days.

Long-term use of UDCA(13-15 mg/kg/day) in patients with PBC improvesserum liver biochemistries and survival free of liver transplantation However; about 40% ofpatients do not respond to UDCA optimally as assessed by known criteria for biochemicalresponse. Those patients represent the group in need for additional therapies; havingincreased risk of disease progression and decreased survival free of liver transplantation.Both lab research and some clinical studies suggest that fenofibrate could improvecholestasis in multiple ways including reduce of bile acid synthesis; increase of biliarysecretion and anti-inflammation effect.

Systemic recurrence following surgery is one of the majorproblems in stage IIIA(N2) patients; and the use of postoperative chemotherapy (POCT) instage IIIA disease prolongs survival. The value of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) forcompletely resected NSCLC remains controversial; as the effect on survival has beeninconclusive. Recently; several large retrospective studies and reviews of the NationalCancer Database indicated that modern PORT appears to confer an additional 5% survivaladvantage beyond that achieved with adjuvant chemotherapy alone. Actually; after completeresection and POCT; 20%-40% of cases have a risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR). Patientswith completely resected stage IIIA(N2) disease might hold different postoperativepatterns-of-failure and prognosis. It is not yet known for subsets with specific prognosticfactors that confer lower LRR risks; whether giving PORT is more effective than no radiationtherapy in treating patients with completely resected pathologic stage IIIA(N2) NSCLC.Purpose: This randomized phase II trial is studying the clinical efficacy of PORTadministered using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) techniques and theproposed standard PORT clinical target volume (CTV) delineation guideline in treating lowrisk of LRR patients with completely resected pathologic stage IIIA(N2) NSCLC.; <br><br>OBJECTIVES:1. Primary-Investigate the value of PORT for completely resected pathologic stage IIIa(N2)NSCLC by comparing the disease-free survival of patients with low risk of LRRtreated with PORT vs no PORT.2. Secondary-Determine the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.-Compare the locoregional recurrence-free survival in patients treated with theseregimens.-Compare the distant metastasis-free survival in patients treated with theseregimens.-Determine patterns of recurrence in patients treated with these regimens.-Determine the treatment-related adverse events of these regimens in these patients.-Determine the prediction models for locoregional recurrence and brain metastasisbased on the clinical; pathological; radiological; genetic; tumormicroenvironmental and immunological data.<br><br>OUTLINE: This is a multicenter; randomized study. The clinical risk prediction model for LRRhas been established based on our large institutional database. On multivariate analysis;heavy cigarette smoking history; cN2 status; and number of involved lymph nodes>4 wereindependently significant factors predicting high risk of LRR. The PI equation was builtincluding the three categorical variables and coefficients based on their level ofsignificance: PIï¼(0.9Ã—smoking history)ï¼‹(0.5Ã—clinical N status)ï¼‹(0.8Ã—number of involved lymphnodes). Patients with the PI score<3.5 were considered as low risk of LRR.Patients are stratified according to participating center; EGFR mutation status (EGFR 19delor 21L858R mutations vs others); and use of pretreatment positron emission tomography scans(yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.Arm I (PORT): Participants in the Arm I will receive four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy andafter that; sequential adjuvant thoracic conformal radiotherapy (50.4 Gy; 1.8 Gy once dailyover 5.5 weeks) will be administered.

How does the optimal cut-off compare with the currently guideline-endorsed 4-METcut-off?; In spite of scarce and non-conclusive evidence on the prognostic value of self-reportedfunctional capacity for perioperative cardiovascular events; the estimation of cardiovascularfunctional capacity in metabolic equivalents (METs) based on a questionnaire represent thecore question in the preoperative cardiac risk assessment in patients undergoing elevatedrisk noncardiac surgery endorsed by ESA; the ESC; and the ACC/AHA. MET-REPAIR will examinethe ability of MET estimated using a questionnaire to predict perioperative cardiovascularevents correcting for preoperative risk factors; (e.g. comorbidity and type of surgery) andcalculate the effect on risk stratification (net reclassification improvement) by theaddition of METs estimated by questionnaire to established risk scores; such as the RevisedCardiac Risk Score (Lee-index) and the NSQIP MICA . Further; investigators will addressalternative approaches to functional capacity estimation (1. ability to climb stairs; 2.self-assessed functional capacity compared to peers; 3. Daily/weekly physical activity) andtheir predictive value for perioperative cardiovascular events.The association between elevated natriuretic peptides prior to noncardiac surgery andperioperative cardiovascular events is well established. However; a direct comparison of thepredictive ability of biomarkers vs. self-reported MET is lacking.

In addition; modelsbased on conventional risk factors have been shown to have limited predictability and severalrestrictions. They were not designed for people with preexisting cardiovascular disease(CVD); and when risk factors are at extreme levels; the equations may underestimate oroverestimate risk. In this regard; interest is increasing in the use of noninvasive markersthat allow the identification of sub-clinical atherosclerosis; including the ankle brachialindex (ABI); ratio of ankle to arm systolic blood pressure). Although quick and easy toperform with a high patient acceptability; the ABI was originally used to identify lower-limbatherosclerosis. However; it has subsequently been shown to be an accurate and reliablemarker of generalized atherosclerosis. Cohort studies between 5 and 10 years of follow-uphave shown that people with a low ABI have an increased risk of both cardiovascular morbidityand mortality. They have previously reported that the 5-year incidence of totalcardiovascular events in subjects with an ABI Ë‚ 0.9 was almost twice that in subjects with anABI Ëƒ 0.9 Furthermore; examination of positive predictive values showed that a low ABI wasbetter at predicting risk of future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events thanconventional risk factors alone.B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac neuro-hormone secreted from membrane granulesin the cardiac ventricles as a response to ventricular volume expansion and pressureoverload. The natriuretic peptide system allows the heart to participate in the regulation ofvascular tone and extracellular volume status. The natriuretic peptide system and the reninangiotensin system counteract each other in arterial pressure regulation. Levels of atrialnatriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are elevated in cardiacdisease states associated with increased ventricular stretch. The main circulating andstorage form of BNP is 32 amino acid peptide with a ring structure. Physiological actions ofBNP are mediated through a guanylate cyclase-linked receptor; natriuretic peptide receptor A(NPR-A). BNP produces arterial and venous vasodilatation. Clearance of BNP is promoted by anatriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C) which removes it from the circulation and BNP is alsodegraded through enzymatic cleavage by neutral endopeptidase. BNP levels are reflective ofleft ventricular diastolic filling pressures and thus correlate with pulmonary capillarywedge pressure.BNP levels have been shown to be elevated in patients with symptomatic left ventriculardysfunction and correlate with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification andprognosis.Based on the available information a BNP < 100 pg/ml; allows clinicians to exclude heartfailure as a cause of the patients' symptoms or physical exam signs in most circumstances BNPlevels have been shown to predict long term mortality in patients with heart failure;independent of other established prognostic variable,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Unknown status,Not yet recruiting,2017-04-18,2017-04-21,2017-04-20,Observational,NA,NA,NA,NA,myocardial ischemia; incidence of myocardial ischemia after operation,myocardial infarction mortality; incidence of myocardial infarction after operation incidence of mortality related to cardiac problems,1234,1234,1234,1234,21,4,2017,blah,1234,1234,1234

Myocardial infarction without ST segment elevation(NSTEMI) is the most common form of infarction. However; its treatment among elderly patientsremains a challenging question.Indeed; the risk benefit balance of revascularization remains unclear; and complicationsrelated to revascularization are more frequent in the elderly; including MI; heart failure;stroke; renal failure and bleeding according to National Cardiovascular Network data.The lastrandomized controlled trial After Eighty Study; showed a reduction of majorcardio-cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in NSTEMI patients with an invasive strategy(systematic coronary angiography - CA) compared to a conservative strategy (medical treatmentalone). Nevertheless; this study presented several limitations of which a major one was thelack of a definition of frailty at inclusion. Moreover; the After Eighty Study has shownthat percutaneous revascularization in the invasive arm was only performed for 1 in 2patients showing an inadequacy in the strategy for selecting candidates forrevascularization.Consequently; despite European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines; the management ofNSTEMI in elderly patients is not yet evidence based; and current recommendations do notprovide any clear clinical decision rule indicating one strategy over another.For fragile patients; an alternative strategy consists of selecting candidates for a guidedCA according to the extent of myocardial ischemia; identified by non-invasive imaging.Single-photon emission computed tomography or dobutamine stress echocardiograms are currentlythe reference methods with well-defined interpretation of ischemia. According to ourexperience; this strategy avoids CA for one third of patients and improves the rate ofrevascularization.The aim of our study is to compare 1-year morbidity and mortality in NSTEMI patients over 80years; assigned to guided versus systematic-CA. Our hypothesis is that the guided strategywill not be inferior on MACE rates at 1 year; and will be cost-effective by reducingiatrogenic complications.; ,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Recruiting,NA,2017-06-07,2017-09-21,2021-07-01,Interventional,Randomized,Treatment,Myocardial Infarction|Infarction|Ischemia|Dobutamine,elderly patients|myocardial infarction|myocardial revascularization strategy|ischemia imaging|coronary artery disease,Rate of MACCE; Rate of MACCE (defined as all-cause death; non-fatal myocardial infarction; non-fatal stroke),Rate of MACCEs and each component of the MACCEs criteria during index hospitalization Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as the extra cost for a QALY (quality adjusted life year) gained by the strategy guided by ischemia imaging compared to the systemic coronary angioplasty strategy The annual financial impact of implementing the strategy guided by ischemia imaging will be calculated from the French Health Insurance System perspective over three years Quality of life using standardized scale : EQ5D-5L Frailty assessment Dependency (ADL) Autonomy (IADL) Incidence of bledding events as defined by the Bleeding Research Consortium (BARC) score Rate of MACCE according to sub-group analysis Create prognostic model with multivariate survival analysis :; MACCE (defined as all-cause death; non-fatal myocardial infarction; non-fatal stroke)    Multiple assessment are necessary to evaluate patient frailty: ADL; IADL; CAM; MNA; Charlson score; SEGA; MMSE; Time up and go test; mini GDS; history of fall    Sub group : age; gender; diabetes; renal failure and frailty Risk Algorithm; setting up a score to choose an invasive strategy or not based on analysis of different score (for example geriatric score),1234,1234,1234,1234,21,9,2017,blah,1234,1234,1234

The figures forperinatal mortality remained unchanged between Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS)1990-91 and PDHS 2012-13. It is hence important to evaluate new techniques to identifyhigh-risk pregnant women who can then subsequently receive personalized care to improveperinatal outcomes. Fetal blood flow waveforms assessed via Doppler ultrasound to indicatewellbeing of the fetus have been in practice for nearly four decades. Abnormal blood flowpatterns in the fetal circulation detected by Doppler ultrasound may indicate poor fetalprognosis. These tracings will then be incorporated in a computational model and combinedwith machine learning; will be used to predict adverse perinatal outcomes.This will be a prospective one group cohort study for a period of twelve months which will bebased in Ibrahim Hyderi; a peri-urban settlement of approximately 70;000 on the south east ofKarachi. The sample size for this study has been calculated based on the outcomes of thepregnancy and was estimated to be 525 pregnant women.Recruitment - Household surveillance will be done by community health workers (CHWs) in thecatchment area in a sequential manner to identify pregnant women. Eligible women between22-34 weeks of gestation on last menstrual period (LMP) will then be explained regarding thepurpose of the study and invited for an ultrasound scan.First and enrollment visit - The first visit window for the ultrasound scan will be between22-26 weeks of gestation. This window is selected because pregnancies at risk may be betteridentified and also visualization of fetal cardiac flow is possible. Based on the rigoroussurveillance; we anticipate that most women will be in this window. The following informationwill be collected:-Socio-demographic information-Medical history; including exposure to tobacco; gravidity; parity; past obstetrichistory (including number of miscarriages; stillbirths or neonatal deaths) and comorbidconditions (pre-eclampsia; diabetes mellitus)-Maternal anthropometry (height; weight and mid-upper arm circumference)-Maternal blood pressure-Hemoglobin of the mother-Symphysiofundal height will be measured-Standard obstetric Doppler evaluation including the four primary ultrasound measures offetal growth-head circumference; biparietal diameter; abdominal circumference; and femurlength is routinely performed for all pregnant women presenting at the center. Theseparameters will be used to estimate fetal weight (automatically calculated by themachine).-Focused Fetal Doppler Echocardiography - These would include transabdominal measurementsof the Doppler velocity of the umbilical artery; the middle cerebral artery (MCA);ductus arteriosus; fetal aortic isthmus (AoI) and left and right ventricular outflowtracts-UmbiFlow - Umbilical artery continuous wave Doppler image will also be obtained on thesewomen. The device will generate graphs for the flow pattern and calculate the resistanceindex for the flow.Second visit - The second visit window of ultrasound scan will be between 30-34 weeks ofgestation. This will be applicable for all women who have had their first scan during 22-26weeks of gestation as well as newly enrolled women during 30-34 weeks of gestational age.Cardiotocography (CTG) will be performed for all recruited women during the second visitfollowed by the Doppler examination. The same procedures as described in the first visit willbe done.Follow up - We will obtain contact information (phone number) from all enrolled women. Atrained research midwife will be responsible for making phone calls; as well as performinghousehold visits at pre-specified intervals for immediate and early identification of thepregnancy outcome. A team of CHWs will perform home visits to the baby at post-natal day 1and 6 and questions related to delayed cry; neonatal sepsis and hospital course (if any) willbe collected and the weight and length of the baby will be recorded.Verbal autopsy - The VA team will visit the family after the grieving period (at least 14days after the death).

Incidences are expected to increase significantly in thefuture due to population aging. For instance; as of 2017; the global population older than 65years is estimated to be 962 million and will increase to 1.4 and 2.1 billion in 2030 and2050 respectively. In Denmark; falls are the most common accidents among older adults witharound 36;000 fall accidents seen annually by the Danish health services and approximately680 deaths yearly. This high frequency of fall accidents may also support the fact that fallsin Denmark are the fourth most common reason for years lived with disability; thereby givingrise to reduced quality of life. Also; falls are associated with elevated morbidity;mortality; poorer physical functioning and early admission to long-term care facilities.Thus; this frequent and escalating problem of fall accidents is of major concern.Fall prevention is therefore highly relevant. It is recognised that fall-preventivestrategies should take on a multifaceted approach due the multifactorial aetiology of falls.This is substantiated by more than 400 risk factors of falling that have now been identified.These spread across different domains including socio-demographics; medical conditions (e.g.atrial fibrillation); medication; physical performance (e.g. reduced lower extremity strengthor reaction time); psychology (e.g. depression or fear of falling) and cognition (e.g. globalcognitive impairment or reduced executive functioning).In order to aid health care professionals in targeting fall-preventive interventions;individual assessments of fall risk are imperative. In Denmark; municipalities are obliged toperform preventive initiatives to preserve the physical; mental and social health along withthe functional capacity and quality of life of their older adults. The aim of theseinitiatives is to enable the older adults to live an independent and meaningful life for aslong as possible. Recently; The Danish Health Authority released an updated manual to supportthis work. This emphasised the need for development of a validated prediction model to beused in a municipally environment to identify older adults at risk of falling. This is due tothe abovementioned consequences of falls. To the knowledge of the authors; this is in linewith literature being sparse on prognostic prediction models on falls in community-dwellingolder adults with data collected outside a clinical environment (i.e. hospitals; GPs andscreening or assessment centres).Objectives:Primary:To develop and internally validate a multifactorial prognostic prediction model on fall riskin community-dwelling older adults in a non-clinical setting. The intended use of the modelis; for municipalities; to identify and refer citizens with high risk of falls tofall-preventive interventions.Secondary:1. To estimate time-consumption for the final prediction model.2. To describe the prevalence of arrhythmias in community-dwelling older adults.; Study design and sample size:A prospective cohort study with 1-year follow-up will be performed in collaboration with themunicipality of HjÃ¸rring; Denmark. A total sample size of 500 participants is expected. Thiswas chosen due to economical and administrative reasons of the municipality contributing withpersonnel to include participants and collect data on predictors. Data for the developmentand internal validation of the model will originate from the same cohort.Study setting; participants; data collectors; process of recruitment and data collection:According to Danish legislation on health and social services; Danish municipalities areresponsible for developing and initiating prophylactic and health-promoting initiatives fortheir senior citizens. This is done through different authorities in the municipality (e.g.preventive-home-visits; senior activity centres). Also; the municipality of HjÃ¸rringadministers a local hall for citizens together with general- and patient associations.Therefore; data collection will be performed in participants' own homes throughpreventive-home-visits; at senior activity centres and at the local hall in the municipalityof HjÃ¸rring; Denmark.Predictors:Data collection of predictors will be performed at baseline. The following predictors werechosen by an expert panel. Reasons are stated at each predictor. First; a brief summary onthe process of how predictors were selected will be given followed by a short description ofeach predictor.- Predictor selection process: A feasibility study. This model is intended for health careprofessionals in a non-clinical setting; in this case the municipality of HjÃ¸rring with asetting consisting of homes and activity centres. Therefore; it needs to be time-efficient;low-cost and practicable. In order to ease implementation if the model is successful inaccuracy; the predictors for data collection was chosen by an expert panel on the basis ofscientific value and experiences from a feasibility study performed as a precursor for thisstudy.The feasibility study investigated the feasibility of measuring a set of predictors; selectedby the expert panel; with regards to time-consumption and user experiences both fromparticipants and data collectors in order to ensure participant and public involvement. Thesepredictors constituted the basis from which final selection for the prospective cohort studywas performed.In order to collect data on predictors in a time-efficient way. It was decided to collectthese both by tests performed by data collectors and questionnaires filled out by studyparticipants. All results from tests and questionnaire will be typed into REDCap (ResearchElectronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University; Nashville; USA) electronic data capture toolhosted at Region Nordjylland; Denmark.Tests:â€¢ Arrhythmias: The investigator's study will be the first to investigate the prevalence ofarrhythmias in a Danish population of older adults (+75 years old) by performing datacollection in participants' own environments (i.e. own homes and activity centres). Allparticipants will receive 5 days of 2-lead continuous heart rhythm monitoring (E-patchsystem; BioTelemetry Inc; Denmark).â€¢ Lower limb reaction time: This was chosen since a slow reaction time was found in earlierstudies to increase the risk of falling.12 Measurements will be performed using a NintendoWii Balance Board with appropriate software Fysiometer (Bronderslev; Denmark).â€¢ Unilateral lower extremity strength: This was chosen since a poor lower strength in lowerextremities was found in earlier studies to increase the risk of falling. Measurements willbe performed using a Nintendo Wii Balance Board with appropriate software Fysiometer(Bronderslev; Denmark).â€¢ Grip strength: This was chosen since a poor grip strength was found in earlier studies toincrease the risk of frailty; which is associated to increased fall risk. Measurements willbe performed using a Nintendo Wii Balance Board with appropriate software Fysiometer(Bronderslev; Denmark).â€¢ Balance with dual-tasking: This was chosen since a poor dual-tasking ability was found inearlier studies to an increased fall risk. Measurements will be performed using a NintendoWii Balance Board with appropriate software Fysiometer (Bronderslev; Denmark).31Simultaneously; participants will be instructed mention as many things one can buy in asupermarket; while attempting to stand still on the board.â€¢ Walking speed: This was chosen since a poor gait speed was found in earlier studies to anincreased fall risk. Participants will be instructed to do a 4-meter walk at regular speed.Time spent will be noted using a stop watch. The fastest of the two measurements will beselected for further analysis.â€¢ Physical activity: This will be measured using an accelerometer incorporated in the hearthrhythm monitoring device.Questionnaire:The following list specifies predictors of falls and participant characteristics that will beincluded in the questionnaire.-Age.-Gender.-Comorbidities.-Medication.-Educational level.-Status of living.-Prior falls.-Walking aids.-Alcohol consumption.-Using multifocal lenses.-Having dogs or cats in the household.-Health-related quality of life using EQ-5D-3L by the EuroQol group-Nutrition status.-Symptoms of urinary incontinence; pain when walking and dizziness.-Patient self-assessment as a measure of self-awareness of fall risk: Do you think thatyou could fall during the next year?-Fear of falling using Short FES-I 7 item.-Depression using Geriatric Depression Scale 4 item.-Frailty using Tilburg Frailty Indicator.-Activities of Daily Living using Vulnerable Elders Survey-Orientation-Memory-Concentration test performed over the telephoneBlinding: Due to nature of the study design; all assessments of predictors for the outcome tobe predicted; future falls; will be blinded.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2018-06-14,2018-08-01,2021-01-12,Observational,NA,NA,NA,Accidental falls|Prediction model,Number of falls; Falls will be monitored using monthly prepaid fall calendars and validated by a phone call if a fall is registered.

NCT03637647,Cardiopulmonary Exercise Variables Are Associated With Postoperative Morbidity and Mortality After Major Oesophagogastric Cancer Surgery - A Multicentre Observational Study; CPET and Outcome After Oesophagogastric Cancer Surgery,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Fitness; Oxygen uptake at estimated lactate threshold<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Sarcopenia defined by skeletal muscle radiation attenuation; Radiation attenuation for skeletal muscle at L3 using Slico-matic software<br><br>SUMMARY:Primary Aim: The present study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collectedclinical data. Anonymized data from patients collected during routine clinical care from 9units in the United Kingdom who undertake upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer surgery andperform pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing will be interrogated. Data will bepooled at a central location (University Hospitals Southampton) and used to investigate therelationship between selected cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) variables; in-hospitalpost-operative and survival outcomes after major UGI cancer surgery.Rationale: Our primary aim is to establish a reliable relationship between post-operative1-year survival and oxygen uptake ( o2) at peak exercise ( o2 Peak); a secondary aim is toexplore the multivariable relationship between selected CPET variables especially o2 at theestimated lactate threshold/anaerobic threshold ( L); together with other selected CPETderived variables; and other important prognostic variables with post-operative complications(morbidity and mortality) in an attempt to risk stratify patients before major UGI surgery.Trial Design: Multicentre observationalInclusion Criteria: We aim to include all patients aged >18 years considered eligible by theMDT for major curative UGI cancer surgery and undergoing an enhanced recovery programme aftersurgery. Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapies will also beincluded. Patients having a CPET and initially scheduled for curative surgery; but end up nothaving surgery due to disease progression or other clinical reasons will be included andanalysed separately.Exclusion Criteria: Patients will be excluded if they are physically unable to perform a CPETon a cycle ergometer; patients having emergency surgery; patients lacking completein-hospital morbidity or mortality data and patients undergoing preoperative exerciseinterventions.Primary Trial Endpoints: 1 year overall survival; Study overview and backgroundWe hypothesise that reduced physical fitness (measured objectively using CardiopulmonaryExercise Testing (CPET)) will result in worse post-operative surgical outcome (reduced 1-yearoverall survival; and increased in-hospital morbidity measured by Clavien-Dindo-DemartinesScore). We propose multicentre patient recruitment and analyses of routinely collectedclinical data; in an attempt interrogate this hypothesis in patients prior to uppergastrointestinal cancer surgery. Patients undergoing cancer therapies pre-operatively(neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) will be included in the analyses. Patientsthat become ineligible for an operation; mainly due to metastasis or progression of theircancer on neoadjuvant cancer treatments will also be included but will be analysedseparately.Despite advances in anti-cancer therapies; surgery remains the most important treatment foroesophageal and gastric cancer. Major UGI cancer surgery carries substantial morbidity andmortality; particularly in elderly patients and those with co-morbidities. Recent UK canceraudits show 30-day mortality of up to 3% for elective surgery and a 90-day mortality rate of5.2%. Outcomes after major cancer surgery depend on modifiable factors such as peri-operativemedical care and intra-operative technique and what were previously thought to beunmodifiable components; such as the ability of the patient to tolerate surgical trauma.Centralisation of services and optimisation of perioperative pathways have led to improvedoutcomes; but substantial gains may yet be achieved with accurate and objective preoperativerisk prediction.Current approaches to risk prediction include a plethora of prediction scores and tests; butnone have proven efficacy above experienced clinical acumen. More recently reduced physicalfitness (objectively measured using CardioPulmonary Exercise Testing - CPET) has beenassociated with increased postoperative morbidity in a variety of major surgical cohorts.CPET provides an objective method of evaluating physical fitness under stress; partlymimicking the stress of a major surgical event. Accurate risk prediction methods prior tosurgery or indeed other forms of 'trauma' like pre-operative cancer therapies might allowbetter patient selection; permit modification of the patients preoperative status; as well asimprove the optimisation of intra- and postoperative management; and enhances shareddecision-making. Furthermore CPET allows interrogation of the causes of exercise intolerance;when exercise capacity is reduced; with the exciting opportunity of intolerance modulationfor therapeutic gain (Fit for Surgery).To date; 37 cohort studies (including over 7;800 patients) have reported the relationshipbetween preoperative CPET-derived variables and postoperative outcome. These data have beenbrought together in several systematic reviews that; in summary; show a remarkably consistentpositive correlation between physical fitness and postoperative outcome. The Southamptonbased Fit-4-Surgery group have clearly demonstrated this in patients undergoing majorcolorectal surgery; however the relationship between fitness and post-operative outcomes inUGI cancer surgery is not yet well defined.METHODOLOGYPatients in all the recruiting centres will undergo a maximal CPET prior to major UGI cancersurgery (defined as a procedure involving oesophageal; junctional or gastric cancerresection) according to the CPET protocol defined in Appendix 1 of protocol. If the CPETdeviates from this protocol; the centre would need to clear their local CPET protocol withthe Chief Investigator (CI). All variables measured by CPET that will be collected areoutlined in Appendix 2 of protocol. If the patient is scheduled to have neoadjuvant cancertherapies; the recruiting site might elect to test patients pre- and post the neoadjuvanttherapy to estimate the change in fitness. This is based on changes observed in fitness withneoadjuvant chemotherapy in UGI and chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer patients.Following surgery only routine clinically relevant observational data will be collected.These data will relate to hospital length of stay; the level of care required followingsurgery; post-operative morbidity (Postoperative Morbidity Survey - POMS and/orClavien-Dindo-Demartins Score) and the recovery process. Most of this information can beaccessed from prospectively maintained enhanced recovery databases; however electronicpatient records that are maintained and recorded prospectively are also acceptablealternatives.Each site would also contribute existing data held on the hospital patient database inaddition to recruiting patients as they present at the hospital as per methodology above. Alldata from each individual hospital will be anonymized at source by the PI prior to transferto the CI and any analyses. CPET variables; post-operative outcome data; and basic patientdemographics (outlined in Appendix 2 of the protocol) cannot be linked back to the originalpatient.All patients undergoing CPET at each NHS site are given a patient information sheet relatedto risks and benefits related to CPET and routinely undergo written consent prior to testing;also asking for their permission for these data to be used for research purposes.Contraindications to CPET based on ACCP/ATS Guidelines. (American Journal of Respiratory andCritical Care Medicine 2003; 167: 211-77)Please see also for further information:http://www.thoracic.org/statements/resources/pfet/cardioexercise.pdfhttp://www.pcpet.co.uk/LinksHYPOTHESISThis study tests the hypothesis that selected CPET variables are related to 1-year overallsurvival and to in-hospital morbidity in patients undergoing major UGI cancer surgery.Our primary aim is to establish a reliable relationship between 1-year overall survival(present or absent) and oxygen uptake (Vo2) at peak exercise (Vo2 Peak); a secondary aim isto explore the multivariable relationship between Vo2 at the estimated lactate threshold(LT); other selected CPET variables (weight; BMI and Body Surface Area (BSA) adjusted) andother important prognostic variables with post-operative complications in an attempt to riskstratify patients before major surgery.3. DATA ANALYSESCardiopulmonary Exercise Tests (CPET)The CPET involves cycling on an exercise bike for 8-12 minutes. Starting with a very lowresistance on the pedals the patient will pedal at 60 revolutions per minute. After 3 minutesof cycling; the resistance will gradually increase until the patient can no longer turn thepedals at the required speed. The test will be thoroughly explained to the patient beforehandand trained staff will make the experience as comfortable as possible. CPETs will be stoppedearly by the study researcher/doctor in the presence of any adverse events. Each CPETappointment will last approximately one hour.CPETs carry a small risk (1:10;000) of exercise induced myocardial infarction or dysrhythmia.Patients are continuously monitored using a 12 lead electrocardiograph (ECG) during all testsand recovery. The CPET test will entail the patient becoming slightly hot or maybe sweaty;and appropriate clothing should be worn. The patient's heart will be monitored by anelectrocardiogram. The patient will wear a soft rubber mask in order to continuously sampleexpired air with an online breath-by-breath gas analyzer. This may cause some mildclaustrophobia. Full detail of the CPET procedure is given in appendix 1. Accredited doctorsor allied health professionals with experience in analysis of exercise tests will analyse allof the exercise data. Patients will be anonymised and the person performing the data analysiswill be blinded to the outcome data. All data will be stored; processed and analysed onsecure NHS computers on NHS encrypted and password-protected servers.4. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGYNon-parametric receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves will be constructed for Vo2 atLT; Vo2 at Peak; O2 Pulse at LT and ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide ( E/ co2 at L)in order to assess their independent ability to discriminate between patients with andwithout post-operative morbidity. All selected CPET variables will be adjusted for weight;BMI and BSA. Optimal cut-points will be obtained by minimising the distance between points onthe ROC curve and the upper left corner. Variables (to satisfy the 10 events per variablerule) will be identified as candidates for a multivariable logistic regression modelincluding but not limited to: Vo2 at LT and at Peak; gender; operation type(laparoscopic/open); and O2 Pulse at LT and VE/VCo2 at LT. A final multivariable model willbe obtained using forward stepwise selection (minimising Akaike Information Criteria (AIC)).Its sensitivity to variable exclusion and re-inclusion will also be assessed using AIC. Modelfit will be assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. In order to explore theunivariate relationship between CPET variables and length of stay; continuous CPET variableswill be dichotomised at the optimal cut-point for the ROC curve and Kaplan-Meier curves willbe constructed. The log rank test will be used to compare survival curves; patients who diedbefore discharge will be treated as right-censored. All analyses will be conducted usingStata (StataCorp. 2011 Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College Station; <br><br>TX: StataCorpLP.). Continuous variables will be reported as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median andinter-quartile range (IQR) depending on the distribution. Categorical variables will bepresented as frequency (percentage). P-values will be obtained using univariate logisticregression (continuous) and Chi-squared or Fisher's Exact tests (categorical). Statisticalsignificance will be taken at 5%.We anticipate an overall death rate of 33.5% in 12 months post-surgery. We assumed that thedeath event rate would increase in the unfit (control) patient group up to 50% while the fitgroup would show the same average of 33.5% rate thus showing a difference of at least 16.5%.We consider that this size of the effect (50% reduced to 33.5%) is clinically relevant.Assuming 5% (2-sided) significance and 90% power; 150 events are needed to detect this sizeof difference in a log-rank survival comparison of the two trial groups. This requires 376patients in total in the analysis. We will inflate this total by approximately 20% to allowfor attrition; giving a target recruitment of 470 patients (with complete data on CPETvariables and outcome).,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Recruiting,NA,2018-08-10,2018-08-20,2020-10-20,Observational [Patient Registry],NA,NA,Gastrointestinal Diseases|Digestive System Diseases,cardiopulmonary exercise testing|oesophagogastric|surgery|chemotherapy,Fitness; Oxygen uptake at estimated lactate threshold,Sarcopenia defined by skeletal muscle radiation attenuation; Radiation attenuation for skeletal muscle at L3 using Slico-matic software,1234,1234,1234,1234,20,8,2018,blah,1234,1234,1234

Afterinformed consent was obtained; the participants will be evaluated through 6MWT. Preoperativeassessment and conditions during operation will be recorded. The investigators will analyzethe correlation between preoperative 6MWT's result and outcomes after laparoscopicgastrointestinal surgery.; This is a prospective observational cohort study; which focus on the prognostic value of6-minute walk test (6MWT) in patients who will undergo laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery.Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is an optimized program which help patients acceleraterecovery and improve outcomes by integrating evidence-based protocols and guidelines. Withthe rapid development of ERAS; the preoperative clinical data of patients are paid more andmore attention to evaluate the risk of perioperative complications and choose an appropriatetime for surgery. A better perioperative evaluation method will lead to lower morbidity andmortality rates of postoperative complications and shorter time of hospital stay. So; it isimportant to find an appropriate evaluation method to predict the outcomes of patientsundergoing surgery.6MWT is a low-cost; easy to operate and well-tolerated test to evaluate exercise tolerance topredict cardiopulmonary function. It has widely used in cardiopulmonary surgery as aprognostic marker. Even though massive studies showed that decreased perioperative 6-minutewalk distance (6MWD) related to postoperative complication in patients underwent cardiac orpulmonary surgery; there are only small numbers of studies with small number sizes presentingcorrelation of decreased 6MWD and postoperative complication in abdominal surgery. Even somestudies of upper abdomen got the opposite result. Furthermore; the critical value for 6MWD isstill controversial. Based on these conditions; this study was designed to investigate if6MWT cloud be used as an accurate assessment with the prognostic value in patients who willundergo laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery to improve the ERAS program.The investigators decide to enroll 200 patients awaiting elective laparoscopicgastrointestinal surgery in this study at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Afterinformed consent was obtained; the patients will be comprehensively evaluated fromdemographic characteristics; complications of systems and organs; laboratory tests results;6MWT; metabolic equivalents (METs); psychological states assessed by hospital anxiety anddepression scale. Outcomes will be assessed according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification ofSurgical Complications. Operative name; operation date; operative method; blood loss;situation of blood transfusion; operation time; duration of anesthesia; whether return to ICUor not (treatment time and tubulization time); drainage flow of within 24 hours after surgerywill be recorded. Other outcome measures include the mortality rate within 30 days aftersurgery; second operation without plan; rehospitalized rate without plan; postoperativehospitalization time; patient satisfaction.Descriptive analysis; univariate analysis; multivariate analysis and establishment ofcomplication prediction model will be used to analyze the correlation between preoperative6MWD and outcomes.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Unknown status,Recruiting,2018-10-10,2018-10-18,2019-07-13,Observational,NA,NA,NA,NA,Postoperative complications; Postoperative complications includes postoperative wound infections; delayed union or nonunion; intraperitoneal abscesses; intestinal obstruction; anastomotic fistula; postoperative hemorrhage which need blood transfusion; pulmonary complications; cardiovascular complications; cerebrovascular complications; thrombotic events; acute liver failure or deterioration of liver function; acute renal failure or deterioration of renal function; urinary infection; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; postoperative delirium; et al.,Mortality rate Second operation without plan Rehospitalized Patient satisfaction; Postoperative death due to any reason During the same hospital stay; unplanned reoperations were performed for a variety of reasons.

The aim of this study was evaluate the clinical significance; including presenttiming; numbers; and correlation to disease relapse; of circulating tumor cell in lung cancerpatients. Investigators want to clarify the clinical significance between circulating tumorcell and clinical presentation of lung cancer in order to establish new prediction model andimprove lung cancer patients' survival.; Lung cancer was a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide. According to statisticaldata from Ministry of Health and Welfare; the incidence of lung cancer related death was 25.5per 100;000 population. According to NCCN guideline; the standard treatment for patients withresectable disease is anatomic resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection. The currentprognostic system; TNM system; was based of patho-histologic characteristics and this systemprovide the most important information about disease-free and overall survival forcorresponding disease severity. According to investigators previous studies; investigators'veidentified risk factors for all lung cancer patients with resectable disease and poorprognostic factors in different TNM stage. Investigators could utilized factors that designedfor all patients as an initial survey and further subgroup patients into high or low risk forrelapse in subsequent stratification that utilized grading system in different TMN stage. Ifinvestigators could identified high risk patients; more aggressive treatment and follow upprogram may decreased risk of disease relapse and prolong patient survival.From literature review; circulating tumor cell was demonstrated its possible role in diseaserelapse.

Indirect muscle injuries (IMI) are aconsiderable burden to elite teams. This investigation aims to evaluate whether measurementsfrom PHE can be used in a multivariable model to predict IMI risk in elite players; or toestablish prognostic factors that are associated with IMIs.; BACKGROUND Indirect muscle injuries (IMIs) are a considerable burden to elite football(soccer) teams and prevention of these injuries offers many benefits. Preseason medical;musculoskeletal and performance screening (termed periodic health examination (PHE)) is usedto help determine players at risk of injuries such as IMIs; where identification ofPHE-derived prognostic factors (PF) may inform IMI prevention strategies. Furthermore; usingseveral PFs in combination within a multivariable prognostic model may allow individualisedIMI risk estimation and specific targeting of prevention strategies; based upon anindividual's PF profile. No such models have been developed in elite football and the currentIMI prognostic factor evidence is limited. This study aims to: 1) to develop and internallyvalidate a prognostic model for individualised IMI risk prediction during a season in elitefootballers; using the extent of the prognostic evidence and clinical reasoning; 2) explorepotential PHE-derived PFs associated with IMI outcomes in elite footballers; using availablePHE data from a professional team.METHODS A retrospective review has been completed of PHE and injury data; routinely collectedover 5 years (from 1st July 2013 to 19th May 2018) from a population of elite male players atan English Premier League football club. Of 60 candidate PFs; 15 were excluded. Ten factorswill be included in model development; identified from a systematic review; missing dataassessment; measurement reliability evaluation and clinical reasoning. A full multivariablelogistic regression model will be fitted; to ensure adjustment before backward elimination.The performance and internal validation of the model will be assessed. The remaining 35candidate PFs are eligible for further exploration; using univariable logistic regression toobtain unadjusted risk estimates. Exploratory PFs will be grouped according to type andincorporated into multivariable logistic regression models to determine risk estimates.DISCUSSION This study will offer insights into clinical usefulness of a model to predict IMIrisk in elite football and highlight the practicalities of model development in this setting.Exploration may identify other relevant PFs for future confirmatory studies; model updating;or influence future injury prevention research.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Completed,NA,2018-12-12,2018-12-20,2018-12-18,Observational,NA,NA,Wounds and Injuries|Sprains and Strains,Athlete|injury prevention|muscle strain|prediction|prognosis|screening|sport,Number of participants with an indirect muscle injury.; Indirect muscle injury defined according to Terminology and Classification of Muscle Injuries Consensus Statement,Number of participants with an indirect muscle injury affecting the hamstring muscle group.

The predictive value of this score was recently revised downward with a C index of theorder of 0.65-0.67 and 20% of the patients enrolled for decompensated cirrhosis have accessto liver transplantation by a subjective system of expert component independent of the MELDbecause of this lack of precision. The use of the MELD score to individually define access tothe transplant should so be reconsidered. Recently new predictive models of cirrhosismortality better than MELD have been developed and new mortality predictors independent ofMELD have been published.The goal of this study is to design prognostic predictive models of mortality fordecompensated cirrhotic patients enrolled on the national liver transplant waiting listincluding known (MELD; MELD Na) as more recent (CLIF-C AD; CLIF - CACLF) predictive modelsand new objective predictors studied in combination in order to optimize the system ofallocation of hepatic allografts in France.The expected benefits of this search are twofold:-At the individual level: The possibility for patients at high risk of death but withintermediate MELD score to be transplanted.-Public health plan:-Improving the equity of graft allocation system.-Decreased mortality in the waiting list by improving the fairness and efficiency ofthe graft allocation system; a major public health issue; ,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2019-01-18,2019-01-29,2020-12-11,Interventional,N/A,Other,Fibrosis,Liver transplantation|Predictive prognostic models|Decompensated cirrhosis,predictive value of the new multivariate prognostic models in patients listed for decompensated cirrhosis; Predictive value of mortality and drop out in the waiting list,Individual predictive value of each of the new candidate predictors Complications predicted by each of the independent predictors Added predictive value for mortality and drop out of new multivariate prognostic models on MELD (model end stage for liver disease) Evaluation of the predictive value of the CLIF (Chronic LIver Failure)-C (cirhosis) AD (Decompensation) score in decompensated cirrhotics listed without organ failure; CRP; copeptin; NT-pro BNP; vitamin D; leucocytes; PMN/lymphocytes ratio; urinary NGal; cystatin C; frailty index; sarcopenia (abdominal tomodensitometry to measure the surface of psoas); caloric intake; encephalopathy (ammonia level; stroop application); and transferrin. infection; renal dysfunction; encephalopathy; bleeding; ACLF  death and drop out,1234,1234,1234,1234,29,1,2019,blah,1234,1234,1234

Numerous studies have examined the ability to improve prognostication fromheart failure; ranging from basic statistical methodologies to machine learning; withimpressive improvements in both predictive indices. However; no study to date has examined;in a randomized fashion; the impact of providing prognostic information on provider behaviorand downstream clinical outcomes. It is for this reason that the investigators plan toperform the Risk EValuation And Its Impact on ClinicAL Decision Making and Outcomes in HeartFailure (REVeAL-HF) Trial within the Yale New Haven Health System. REVeAL-HF is a randomized;single-blind intervention trial that is testing the clinical impact of providing prognosticinformation to the provider on heart failure outcomes in the inpatient settings. The studyhypothesis is that electronic alerting about prognostic information on heart failure patientsalong with links to guidelines will lead to reductions in all-cause mortality and 30-day HFhospitalizations via improved use of guideline directed medical therapy and more adequatedecongestion.; Heart failure is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States and WesternEurope and prognosis in individual patients is highly variable. Quantifying a patient'ssurvival prospects based on their overall risk profile has the potential to help identifythose patients in need of more intensive monitoring and help target appropriate populationsfor therapies. In fact; several comprehensive risk scores in patients with heart failure arecurrently available for both reduced and preserved ejection fraction but their applicabilityto contemporary heart failure populations is unknown. Additionally; the impact of knowing apatient's prognostic information on treatment decisions in heart failure has never beenstudied. Therefore; guidelines do not recommend using risk assessments to decide ontherapeutic decision making in heart failure due to a lack of data for this strategy. Theinvestigators have proposed a randomized controlled trial be conducted of an electronic alertsystem that informs practitioners about their patients risk of inpatient mortality and 1-yearpredicted mortality using data from the electronic health record (EHR). The primary outcomefor the trial will be a composite of all-cause mortality and 30-day risk of heart failurerehospitalization. The secondary outcomes will be length of stay; discharge doses of heartfailure therapies; palliative care referral; referral for advanced therapies like transplantor mechanical circulatory support; referral to electrophysiology; and change in weight duringhospitalization (aggressiveness of diuresis).

NCT03921697,Parkinson App SmarTphone Aimed to Improve Walking Ability and Reduce Fall (P.A.S.T.A.); Improving Walking Ability in Parkinson Disease,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Correlations between inertial sensor-derived measures of motor function and clinician ratings during performance of the UPDRS part 3 and total exam at baseline; Features extracted from continuous accelerometer signals recorded during real life for fourteen days; will be correlated with each relevant component of the UPDRS part 3 and corresponding clinician ratings to quantify the relationship between these measures.<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Time Up&Go; Time Up&Go is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance.

During the test; the person is expected to wear their regular footwear and use any mobility aids that they would normally require.<br><br>SUMMARY:Gait impairments of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) limit the independence in thedaily activities and sensibly increase the risk of falls. New gait analysis methods; based onwearable inertial sensors; have been proposed to track the gait features during treatment andin real-life conditions. Gait training based on auditory cues as Rhythmical AuditoryStimulation (RAS) have preliminarily shown positive effects improving gait velocity; stridelength; step cadence of walking in PD. In the current project; the research group will aim todevelop a smartphone application (Parkinson App Smartphone Aimed: P.A.St.A.) integrated withsensors and RAS. In a second time; investigators will analyze the spatio-temporal gaitparameters obtained by the wearable sensors and the sociodemographic and clinical data; thusgenerating a big data set; to improve the knowledge about current pharmacological therapiesand rehabilitation.; Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive movement disorder; mainly due to analtered motor control. Gait impairments are the primary symptoms in patients with PD; with adecreased step length and walking speed; abnormal gait phases distribution; inconstant pace;gait asymmetry and reduced joint coordination. The postural instability and the deteriorationof the gait features sensibly increase the risk of falls in these patients; resulting in lossof independence and a worsening of long-term prognosis. It has been clearly demonstrated thatmotor impairments are connected to a dysfunction of basal ganglia; a brain structure thatworks as a pacemaker for the activation (and deactivation) of each sub-movement within arepetitive movement sequence. Disruption of internal rhythmic cues in PD may explain the poorsmoothness of the movement execution and the difficulties in regulating stride length;resulting in a cadence increase. Levodopa therapy is the most effective treatment to improvethe symptoms in PD; but a long-term administration reduces its efficiency over time and it isresponsible for collateral effects (dyskinesia). Hence; researches have investigatedalternative non-pharmacological approaches; based on auditory cues as the Rhythmical AuditoryStimulation (RAS). A large number of studies have reported positive effects both after asingle session of treatment and after longer training programs; with improved gait velocity;cadence; and stride length as well as in the symmetry of muscle activation for upper andlower extremities. In such studies; RAS frequencies are pre-set as percentages of thepatient's preferred walking frequency. Because the duration of all the therapies may changeover time; it is necessary a continuous adjustment of the dosage and type of treatment; basedboth on patients' monitoring of the symptoms and on objective evaluations. Gait analysis (GA)methods have been proposed and validated for the study of physiologic gait and in severaldiseases. The traditional systems of GA are based on optoelectronic systems; but they areexpensive; not portable and requiring skilled operators. The assessment is always performedin laboratories with experimental set-ups; likely different from real-life walking (noiseenvironments; presence of objects and people or unlevelled pavement; different colors).Consequently; traditional GA is not reliable for the daily control of the treatments or forthe assessment of the real-life situations. Recently; researchers have developed wearablesystems; based on Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). Even if a considerable number of studieshave explored the validity of IMUs analysis; very few have been involved in PD motionanalyses. During the last few years; a set of wearable devices embedding inertial sensors;are spread on the market as low-cost solutions for monitoring human motion activities. While;they still have to be fully validated in accuracy; these systems can provide the userinformation to track his/her own activity. This persuasive technology has a terrificpotential to enhance physical activity and motivation of the patients; with the advantage ofprolonged and continuous recording.The use and the analyses of a large amount of objective data (big data set) is the newfrontier for an efficient use of scientific time and resources; engaging the carecoordination program; saving economic resources; and providing a higher quality of care. Inaddition; these systems; integrated with a web-based application; telemedicine and mobilesmartphones; could help clinicians to address more properly the treatments through areal-time monitoring in an everyday life. Our research group has been involved in theclinical evaluation of different aspects of gait quality in many neurological conditions; PDincluded. Investigators have already shown as wearable accelerometers could be useful in thequantitative assessment of the dynamic gait stability; in correlation with clinical scores.Researchers have also found that accelerations could be altered in a pathology-specificmanner (intellectual disabilities performing different tasks simultaneously). A similarcondition can be observed also in PD; showing that only the intrinsic gait harmonysignificantly correlate with severity of gait impairments. In the recent years; a lot ofwearable tools have become available to quantify the daily activity. This is particularlyimportant for possible therapeutic use of the RAS; that is addressed to restore a harmonicpace in patients with PD.Specific Aim 1: To analyze motor pattern in PD patients in real life setting; gait featureswill be obtained by wearable sensors in order to relate them with clinical and demographicaldata.Specific Aim 2: To improve walking abilities and to reduce the risk of falls in patients withPD; researchers will test a real-time acoustic feed-back (RAS) and alerts from integratedsensors connected with a suitable and easy-to-use application for smartphones.Specific Aim 3: To improve pharmacological and rehabilitative protocols; investigators willanalyze the daily life gait and motility data and the clinical features to test thetheoretical risk model of falls.Experimental Design Aim 1: Patients with PD will be recruited at Fondazione PoliclinicoUniversitario Gemelli and Fondazione Don Gnocchi ONLUS in Rome. All included patients will beaffected by idiopathic PD. Clinical data will be acquired by a trained neurologist.Three hundred patients will be remotely monitored through wearable sensors. Subjects will beinstructed to wear the sensor for 14 consecutive days. Each patient will have more than 100measurements every second; generating a large amount of data; which will be stored in adatabase and subsequently filtered for data of interest. Spatio-temporal gait parameterswillprovide information to monitor the performance of patient's walking in order to get anaccurate measure of the overall efficacy of the locomotor function. Then; they will beintegrated with the electronic patient records. Clinical data; as physician's prescriptions;medical imaging and other administrative data will be recorded. Finally; a risk model for theprediction of falls will be constructed.Experimental Design Aim 2: After the analysis of the obtained data; an application will bedeveloped (Parkinson App Smartphone Aimed: P.A.St.A.); it will be characterized byreliability; easy-to-use; visual clarity; and affordability.This application will be able to: 1) record the gait features sending them to a server in thecloud; 2) provide acoustic feedback adapted on patient's gait features (with higher or lowerfrequency on the basis of the patient's needs and on the predictive risks); 3) provide alerton the basis of risk indices (risk indices will be identified according to a risk model forthe prediction of falls) and 4) be updated whenever needed (e.g. after a fall). Fiftypatients will be provided with a smartphone; after a training on the use of the softwareapplication developed by the team project. They will use the application for a period of 14consecutive days. Clinical assessments with scales will be performed; pre- and post-use ofP.A.St.A.; to analyze the motor function and the postural stability and; finally; the qualityof life. In addition; the compliance to the adoption of the novel technology will beinvestigated.Experimental Design Aim 3: The obtained computational data will be related with clinicalfeatures and gait patterns to identify clinical biomarkers for gait impairment in PD. Theavailability of a big data-sets; powered by the assessments of thousands of patients with PD;will allow the improvement of knowledge on motor pattern in real life setting and to improvethe current therapeutic approach.Metodologies and statistical analyses: All statistical analyses will be conducted using Statasoftware.AIM 1 - Data will be summarized as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.Continuous variables will be analyzed as means and standard deviations or medians and ranges.Investigators will look for normality by using normal plots or by significance tests (e.g.Shapiro-Wilk W test). The incidence of falls will be measured and the circumstances underwhich they occur and their consequences will be described; categorized as no injury; minor ormajor injuries. A multiple logistic regression analysis will be used to determine independentpredictors of falls. Variables will be selected for entry into the logistic model based onthe results of a univariate analyses. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodnessof-fit test will be used toassess how well the model accounted for specific outcomes. The prediction model for fallswill be developed from the results of the multivariate analysis. The predictive score will becalculated by odds ratio based scoring method; and the nearest integer scores will beassigned to each predictor. Model discriminative power will be evaluated byreceiver-operating characteristic area under the curve analysis.AIM 2 - Data recorded will be processed to extract gait and dynamic balance parameters. Theincidence of falls; the use of RAS and its correlation to the risks indices within the 14days of follow-up will be measured. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be performed tocompare the number of fall(s) before and after the use of P.A.St.A.AIM 3 - Spatio-temporal gait parameters; and demographic and clinical characteristics ofpatients before therapies; will be compared using the Chi squared test; Fisher's exact test;and independent t-tests where appropriate.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Unknown status,Recruiting,2019-03-18,2019-04-19,2020-01-30,Observational,NA,NA,Parkinson Disease,Technological Rehabilitation; Digital Inclusion,Correlations between inertial sensor-derived measures of motor function and clinician ratings during performance of the UPDRS part 3 and total exam at baseline; Features extracted from continuous accelerometer signals recorded during real life for fourteen days; will be correlated with each relevant component of the UPDRS part 3 and corresponding clinician ratings to quantify the relationship between these measures.,Time Up&Go; Time Up&Go is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair; walk three meters; turn around; walk back to the chair; and sit down.

It candeteriorate into severe adverse event. However some are discharged before these events occur.The Oakland-Jairath score was developed to help determine which patients can be safelydischarged and which should be admitted from the ER to the hospital. The score did well inits development; but now needs to be externally validated by other independent cohorts. Thelimitations of the first study will be addressed in our study. The goal of this study is toperform the first prospective; multi-centered; external validation of the Oakland-Jairathrisk score on an independent and diverse population who present to the emergency room withLGIB.; Of critical importance in the approach to care of these patients is differentiating themajority of people who can be safely discharged for outpatient management from those who areat risk for serious adverse events and require hospitalization. Recently; Oakland and Jairathdeveloped a clinical prediction rule for safe discharge among patients with LGIB using datafrom their UK National Audit. The next step in the development of a clinical prediction ruleis external validation in independent cohorts. Measures of predictive accuracy for riskscores; such as the AUC; are overly optimistic when calculated from the derivation cohortfrom which the risk score was derived. Therefore; it is essential to evaluate its performanceusing independent and diverse validation cohorts. Thus; the goal of this study is to performthe first prospective; multi-centered; external validation of the Oakland-Jairath risk scoreon an independent and diverse population who present to the emergency room with LGIB. This isa prospective multi-centre observational study to externally validate the Oakland-JairathLGIB risk score; herein referred to simply as the risk score.Consecutive patients presenting to hospital over a 6 month period will have their risk scorecalculated and followed for the development of an adverse outcome over a 28 day period. Therisk score will be determined for research purposes only but will be shared with the treatingphysician if requested as the details of the risk score itself is within the public domain.Patients will be eligible regardless of discharge status and all admission decisions will bemade solely by the treating physicians. To increase the diversity of the validation cohort;increase generalizability; and hasten recruitment; the study will be conducted at 4 centres:Western University; University of Alberta; University of Montreal; and McGill University.,TRUE,prognostic,development; validation,Recruiting,NA,2019-04-30,2019-05-02,2021-08-31,Observational,NA,NA,Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage|Hemorrhage,lower gastrointestinal bleeding|external validation|prognostic risk score|safe discharge|multi-centre cohort study|obscure gastrointestinal bleeding|hospital presentation,Discrimination of the Oakland-Jairath score for predicting safe discharge; Discrimination; defined as the ability of the prediction model to differentiate between those who develop and do not develop the outcome event of interest; as measured by the c-statistic; and calibration; defined as the agreement between predicted and observed outcomes; measured by a calibration plot; of the Oakland-Jairath score for predicting safe discharge; defined as the absence of ALL of the following:i.

The number of stroke is anticipatedto increase with 50% within 2030 due to a growing number of elderly. Many of them will havesevere function deficits and reduced quality of life. The investigators have established acohort consisting of 800 patients with first time ischemic stroke treated at hospitals inCentral Norway. The investigators want to study the incidence and prognostic markers fordeath; recurrent stroke and severe functional deficits during a period of 10 years after theinitial ischemic stroke. The investigators want to focus on the impact of physicalfunctioning; the level of physical activity and use of medication for secondary prevention onthe incidence of death; recurrent stroke and severe functional deficits. The investigatorsare especially interested in the importance of fulfilling the treatment targets for bloodpressure and cholesterol and the importance of smoking cessation in stroke survivors. Ourobjective is to improve todays stroke treatment and achieve a more efficient use of thehealth resources in order to increase survival after stroke maintaining a good physical andpsychological function and quality of life.; MIDNOR STROKE is a descriptive prospective longitudinal cohort study; which includes patientswith a first event of ischemic stroke admitted to hospitals in Central Norway. The overallobjective of this study is to complete a 10-year follow-up of patients with ischemic stroke.Patient recruitment started 01.09.2015 and ended 01.11.2017. During this time-period; a totalof 802 patients were recruited. Patient follow-up at 3 months is completed and follow-up at12 months will be completed 01.11.18.All participants met the following inclusion criteria; cerebral infarction according toICD-10 CM code I63; > 18 years of age; first time stroke; resident in Central-Norway andrecruited within a timeframe of 7 days of hospital admission. Patients were excluded if focalneurological symptoms turned out to be not stroke-related or if there were significantphysical disabilities prior to stroke (defined as Modified Rankin â‰¥5)Eligible stroke patients were recruited during acute stay in hospital. Written informedconsent was obtained from all potential stroke patients and from their legal caretakers(mostly a close family member); admitted to the hospital and each subject signed an informedconsent form. All participants were examined and treated in line with The RecommendedGuidelines for treatment and rehabilitation of stroke; which includes clinical examinations;blood tests; assessment of risk profile and additional relevant examinations.Stroke patients were recruited and patient data collected by a designated nurse during theinitial stay at the hospital. Either a nurse or research assistant in the project performedpatient follow-up at 3 and 12 months. Data collected at 3 months included data from aclinical and physical assessment; interview; questionnaires and medical records. Follow-updata at 12 months is collected by phone interview and questionnaires.The data have been collected at baseline; 3 - and 12 months. Further data collection isplanned at 3; 5 and 10 years.The comprehensive data collection in MIDNOR STROKE at baseline includes data on pre-strokefunction (Barthel index; Nottingham ADL; Modified rankin scale); life style risk factors;stroke severity (NIHSS; SSS; TOAST classifications); previous disease; vital signs (i.e.blood pressure; pulse; oxygen saturation); blood values; complications during hospital stay;medication and medical images during hospital stay. Assessment at 3 months includedinformation on physical function; physical activity (HUNT - International physical activityquestionnaire); cognitive function (Montreal cognitive assessment); depression (Hospital andanxiety and depression scale); fatigue (Fatigue severity score) and health related quality oflife (EQ- 5D- 5L). Data collection at 12 months includes data on physical function;medication; depression; fatigue and health related quality of life.Additional data will be collected from the Norwegian Stroke Registry; The Norwegian Patientregistry; The Norwegian cardiovascular disease registry and The Norwegian Cause of Deathregistry.The overall aim for MIDNOR STROKE is to establish a cohort of patients with first- timestroke to study the occurrence and predictors for recurrent stroke; mortality; physicalactivity; disability and the quality of life during a 10-year period.MIDNOR STROKE contains six work packages; which address the key areas of interest in theproject:1. Recurrent stroke; mortality; disability and quality of life after stroke2. Secondary prevention of stroke in relation to recurrent stroke; mortality; disabilityand quality of life.3.

NCT04009798,Physician Intuition Versus Model Predicted Prognosis in Heart Failure; Predicted Prognosis in Heart Failure,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Mortality. Heart Transplant. Left Ventricular Assist Device; All-cause mortality Heart transplant within 1 year of study enrolment Left ventricular assist device implant within 1 year of study enrolment<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Heart Failure Hospitalization Utilization of health resources and related costs; Heart failure related hospitalizations within 1 year of study enrolment Use and cost associated with health resource use within 1 year of study enrolment<br><br>SUMMARY:The purpose of the project is to conduct a physician-initiated Canadian multicentreobservational research study that compares physician judgement and model prediction toestimate one-year survival in ambulatory heart failure (HF) patients and evaluate the use ofresources according to physician intuitive risk. This study will evaluate the accuracy andimpact of physician intuition and predictive models in the assessment of prognosis inambulatory HF patients by: comparing 1-year physician predicted survival and 1-year observedsurvival to 1-year model predicted survival; evaluating whether model performance could beenhanced by incorporating physician intuition; evaluating the accuracy of physician intuitionaccording to level of confidence in physician intuition (very low; low; moderate; high orvery high); evaluating whether physician expertise impacts accuracy of physician intuition;and evaluating patient management and use of resources according to physician estimatedsurvival.; Heart failure (HF) is a large and growing medical and economic problem; with over 26 millionpeople suffering worldwide. The prognosis associated with HF is poor. Optimal management ofpatients with HF; crucial to improve outcomes and minimize costs; depends on adequateassessment of prognosis to decide on appropriate testing and intervention.There are predictive models; with satisfactory discrimination and calibration; that canaccurately estimate mortality in HF patients. Despite their availability; physicians seldomuse these models; instead relying on their informed intuition; which has proven to belimited. No studies have compared physician intuition (standard practice) and model predictedsurvival in patients with HF. The investigators therefore propose a Canadian multicentrestudy comparing physician intuition and model prediction to estimate one-year survival inambulatory HF patients and secondly to assess the possible impact of intuition versus modelprediction on the use of resources. Evaluating whether predictive models are more accuratethan physician intuition will inform the best strategy to assess patient prognosis in HF.More accurate prognostic estimates will facilitate patient management by matching the needfor further therapy or testing to patient risk thus offering greater clinical benefit andimproving utilization of resources.This study will evaluate the accuracy and impact of physician intuition and predictive modelsin the assessment of prognosis in ambulatory HF patients by: i. comparing the accuracy of1-year physician predicted survival and 1-year model predicted survival to the true(observed) 1-year survival; ii. evaluating the accuracy of physician intuition according tophysician's level of confidence in their intuition (very low; low; moderate; high or veryhigh); iii. evaluating whether physician expertise impacts accuracy of physician intuition;iv. evaluating whether physician gender; patient gender and physician-patient genderconcordance impact accuracy of physician intuition; and v. studying the association betweenphysician estimated survival and resource use and related cost.The investigators hypothesize that predictive models will more accurately predict mortalitythan physicians; with more marked differences in less experienced physicians or whenphysician confidence in estimate is low. Physicians will use more resources when theyconsider patients to be high risk. If these hypotheses prove correct; incorporation ofuser-friendly systems to estimate prognosis into clinical practice can offer clinicalbenefit; facilitate patient management and improve utilization of resources.This is a Canadian multicentre prospective cohort study of consecutive consenting ambulatoryadult heart failure (HF) patients followed in a HF clinic. Participating centers includetertiary care hospitals with dedicated HF clinics in British Columbia (St. Paul's Hospital;Providence Health Care Centre); Manitoba (St. Boniface General Hospital); Ontario (TorontoGeneral Hospital; St. Michael's Hospital; Ottawa Heart Institute; Sunnybrook Hospital; MountSinai Hospital; Hamilton Health Science; Southlake Regional Health Centre); Quebec (McGillUniversity Health Centre); and Nova Scotia (Nova Scotia Health Authority). These clinicsattend to different HF populations permitting a wide representation of patient profiles.After obtaining written informed consent; research assistants will collect clinical andlaboratory data from electronic records and paper charts necessary to describe the patientpopulation and to calculate predictive model survival. These constitute part of the routineclinical assessment and will include demographic characteristics (age; sex; race);co-morbidities (diabetes; hypertension; smoking; peripheral vascular disease; chronic lungdisease); HF characteristics and history (underlying cause; LVEF by echocardiogram; last HFhospital admission; medications and use of ICD and/or cardiac resynchronization therapy) andphysical examination (body mass index (BMI); current NYHA class; heart rate; and bloodpressure at rest). Laboratory values will include hemoglobin; leucocytes; lymphocytes;electrolytes; BUN (blood urea nitrogen); serum creatinine; total cholesterol and uric acid.Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP and peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2)will be collected when available. Cardiac rhythm and QRS duration will be collected byelectrocardiography and peak oxygen consumption by cardiopulmonary exercise study.This study will include physicians with different level of expertise in HF (HF cardiologistsand Family Physicians). Physicians will be asked to provide their intuitive estimates of thelikelihood of survival at one year following the patient baseline clinic visit. Physicianswill be blinded to the predicted model survival. In the survey; the physician will: (1)estimate patient 1-year survival in absolute terms (from 0% to 100%); (2) rate the confidencein their prediction (from 1 - no confident at all to 5- very confident); (3) collect theirimpression about the possibility of initiating assessment to evaluate candidacy for advancedheart failure therapies including heart transplant or mechanical circulatory support in thenext year (1- not a candidate; 2- patient is already listed; 3- too early; and 4-patient is acandidate); and (4) record status of optimization of medical management (1- beginningoptimization; 2- early in the process; 3- late in the process; and 4- completed). Patientcandidacy to advanced HF therapies and status of optimization can influence the use ofresources. If a patient is not a candidate for advanced HF therapies or is already underoptimal medical therapy; the use of resources will be lower compared to candidate patients orpatients under medical therapy optimization. This will be considered in the analysis of theimpact of physician intuitive risk on resource utilization.There are many predictive models in HF. Of these; the investigators have chosen three modelsbased on comparably acceptable performance: the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM); the HFMeta-Score and the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) score. Thesemodels include a set of different variables; they have been validated in contemporary cohortsof HF patients and have demonstrated excellent calibration and discrimination with ac-statistic >0.70.Patients will be followed until the last recruited patient is followed for a minimum of1-year and the following outcomes will be collected: i. Death; urgent VAD implant and urgentheart transplant. Urgent VAD implant or heart transplant will be defined by the use ofintravenous inotropic support at the time of the surgery. The investigators will collect thisinformation from electronic records and by linking with the administrative databases housedat the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) via OHIP number or name and date ofbirth (retrieved from the patients' medical records) using deterministic/probabilisticlinkage. CIHI is an independent; not-for-profit organization that provides essentialinformation on Canada's health systems. This entity houses 28 pan-Canadian databases acrossvarious health sectors. CIHI holds ISO/IEC 27001:2005 certification for information securitymanagement. ii. Utilization of health resources and related costs will be collected bylinking the project database to the administrative databases; administered by the CIHIDischarge Abstract Database (CIHI DAD) and CIHI National Ambulatory Case Reporting System(CIHI NACRS). Cost information will be obtained and estimated from the HF clinic at TorontoGeneral Hospital; which is representative of other HF clinics. The cost associated toresources in other provinces will be adjusted by a calculated coefficient using publiclyprovincial health cost information. The investigators will collect inpatient and outpatientcosts and resources from clinic visits; imaging and laboratory tests; cardiac rehabilitation;hospitalization and visits to an emergency department.Continuous variables will be expressed as a mean and standard deviation (SD) or median andinterquartile ranges for variables with non-Gaussian distributions. All discrete variableswill be expressed as counts (n) and percentages (%) of the study population. The statisticalanalysis will be performed using SAS 9.4 (North Carolina; USA).The investigators will assess physician intuition in comparison to the performance ofpredictive models by comparing their discrimination; calibration and risk reclassification.Physician intuition and model prediction accuracy will be evaluated separately by physicianexpertise: HF cardiologists and family physicians. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportionalhazards model will be used to predict 1-year event-free survival with the score from eachmodel and physician intuition to assess calibration and discrimination; respectively. HFclinics may see a set of different HF patients and HF cardiologists practicing in the same HFclinic will potentially have similar practice and intuition. In order to consider thispotential confounding effect; the analysis will be adjusted for HF clinic region (GreaterToronto Area; Ontario; Quebec; Manitoba; Nova Scotia and British Columbia). Follow up will becensored as alive at the time of non-urgent VAD or heart transplant or last clinic visitafter a year follow up. Observed versus predicted survival will be used to assess calibrationillustrating the relationship in a scatter plot and will assess and compare intuition andpredictive models' discrimination using Harrell's c-statistic.The investigators will then use risk reclassification analysis (reclassification tables andreclassification calibration test) and absolute net reclassification improvement (NRI) toassess global model performance of physician intuition in comparison to the predictivemodels. Risk reclassification analysis will be used to show how patients classified byphysician intuition are reclassified by the predictive models and will compare the observedand predicted survival in each cross-classified category. The absolute NRI represents the netproportion of patients correctly or incorrectly classified assessing if patients werereclassified in the correct direction; i.e. if survivors are reclassified as having bettersurvival and deceased patients are reclassified as having lower survival. For this analysis;patients will be classified based on deciles of 1-year predicted survival (100-90%; 90-80%;80-70% and <70%).The association between physician intuition and utilization of health resources will beevaluated by categorizing patients in the pre-defined risk categories (low; medium; high orvery high risk). Multivariate logistic regression will be used to evaluate the associationbetween physician intuition and resources measured as binary variables (i.e. referral tospecialists or palliative care) and multivariable Poisson regression to evaluate theassociation between physician intuition and resources measured as count variables (i.e.clinic visits) adjusted for region. Cost analysis will be used to evaluate the associationbetween total annual cost and physician intuition. Cost will be described using median andinterquartile range due to expected positively skewed distribution and evaluate itsassociation with physician intuition using generalized linear models with a gammadistribution adding region as a fixed effect. The investigators will evaluate the impact ofmodel predictive survival using the results from the risk reclassification analysis (e.g. ifthe predictive model better reclassified 10% of high-risk patients; 10% of the increased costof treating high-risk patients may be saved by using the model).,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Active; not recruiting,NA,2019-07-03,2019-07-05,2021-04-29,Observational,NA,NA,Heart Failure,heart failure|risk prediction|prognosis,Mortality.

Plaque progression is an indicator of worsening of carotid atherosclerosis. Percent change in indexed volume of noncalcified coronary plaque detected by CCTA indicate the coronary atherosclerosis condition in the patient. Percent change in indexed volume of the sum of fatty and fibrous plaque detected by CCTA indicate the coronary atherosclerosis condition in the patient.<br><br>SUMMARY:Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with an increased riskof myocardial infarction (MI). Using coronary computer tomography angiogram (CCTA); it isfound that a significantly higher prevalence of high-risk coronary plaque (non-calcifiedplaque [NCP]); supporting the notion that more aggressive cardiovascular (CV) evaluationstrategy should be considered in these patients.Carotid ultrasound screening in this population may be a better alternative than traditionalrisk score to identify patients at high CV risk as the latter underestimated CV risk.Previous study from our group have demonstrated that achieving treatment target (minimaldisease activity [MDA]) can prevent progression of carotid atherosclerosis. Nevertheless; 38%of this Treat to Target (T2T) cohort still had carotid plaque progression.Project descriptionit is hypothesized that combination of a T2T stratgy together with high-intensityrosuvastatin treatment (Group 1: T2T-statin group) is more effective in preventingprogression of coronary and carotid atherosclerosis than T2T stratgy alone (Group 2: T2T-onlygroup) in high-risk PsA patients with carotid plaque.The primary outcome is to ascertain the effect of T2T strategy with high-intensityrosuvastain (Group 1: T2T-statin group) on the change in CIMT over a period of 12 monthscompared with T2T strategy alone (Group 2: T2T-only group); Treatment protocol This is a 1-year prospective; hospital-based; open-label; randomized;controlled trial. The trial comprised two arms. Group 1 will receive T2T strategy togetherwith rosuvastain 20mg daily (T2T-statin group). Group 2 will receive T2T strategy only(T2T-only group). The method of concealed random allocation will be used. Simplerandomization will be conducted by a computer-generated random list.Use of statins The patients will be given the necessary number of rosuvastatin tablets ateach visit. At the following visits; surplus medication will be returned to the investigator.Compliance is calculated as a percentage; based on the number of tablets returned.No trials to date that have evaluated effects on CVD events have tested any medication incombination with statins or treatment to specific LDL-C goals; therefore we do not intensifythe regimen for any particular level of LDL-C response. Measuring LDL-C response afterinitiating therapy in this study is mainly to assess adherence. In this primary preventiontrial; in patients who do not tolerate statins; no lipid-lowering therapy will beadministered. Potential interventions include lifestyle modification.Use of DMARDs All participants will receive a 1-year protocolized treatment with the aim toachieve MDA. A predefined treatment protocol is developed based on the EULAR recommendationsand the Hong Kong guideline for the use of bDMARDs. Patients fulfilling the criteria forbDMARDs can either pay out of pocket or can apply for the Samaritan Fund for financialassistance; provided they must pass a household-based financial assessment(http://www.ha.org.hk/visitor/ha_visitor_index.asp?content_id=212020). When patient cannotachieve treatment goal within 3-6 months of therapy; the treatment therapy will be escalatedto the next step according to the protocol; unless the patient declined or toxic effectspreclude this approach. For the introduction of DMARD only joint involvement is taken intoaccount. The participants with active disease who failed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug(NSAID) or those with poor prognostic factor will start with methotrexate monotherapy; whichis increased to 20mg/week or maximum tolerated dose. Subsequent steps for patients who failto achieve treatment goal include switching to other conventional synthetic DMARDs(csDMARDs); combination csDMARD therapy or TNFi; ustekinumab; secukinumab or tofacitinib.Intra-articular steroid or local steroid injection to enthesitis and dactylitis are allowedduring the study but will be forbidden in the 4 weeks before assessment.Clinical Assessment Assessment performed at each visit include pain; physicians' andpatients' global assessments; number of tender joints count (TJC) and swollen joints count(SJC) (using the 68 tender/66 SJC); Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score(MASES); number of digits with dactylitis; ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score(ASDAS); modified health assessment questionnaire (M-HAQ); Disease Activity index forPsoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA); Psoriasis Area (BSA); Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index(PASI) were used to measure joint and skin disease activity.(31) MDA was used for assessmentof treatment efficacy endpoint. The MDA criteria assess 7 domains [TJC â‰¤ 1; SJC â‰¤ 1;enthesitis count â‰¤ 1; skin (â‰¤ 1 or BSA â‰¤ 3%); function (measured by the Health AssessmentQuestionnaire); â‰¤ 0.5; patient's global VAS on a 100-mm scale â‰¤ 20; and patient pain VAS on a100 mm scale â‰¤ 15]. If 5 of 7 of the cutoffs for these domains are met; then the patient isdeemed to be in MDA.Cardiovascular assessments The following anthropomorphic assessment will be performed at eachvisit. Anthropomorphic measurements include body heights; body weight; waist and hipcircumferences; two consecutive blood pressure readings in sitting position and heart rate.Hypertension status is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) â‰¥140mmHg or diastolic bloodpressure (DBP) â‰¥90mmHg or the use of antihypertensive agents. Other data include menopausalstatus; smoking and drinking habits; history of DM; hypertension; hypercholesterolemia; overtCVD; and family history of CVD; DM in first-degree male relatives <55 years of age orfirst-degree female relatives <65 years of age. Drug history is retrieved from case notes orelicited during the clinical assessment.Laboratory assessments and inflammatory markers Laboratory assessments at each visit includecomplete blood count; liver and renal function tests; creatine kinase (CK); ESR andC-reactive protein (CRP); fasting blood glucose; lipid profile (total cholesterol [TC];LDL-C; high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [HDL-C]; triglycerides); fibrinogen and uricacid.Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and plaque CIMT and plaque will be assessed at baselineand 12 months.CIMT will be measured using a high-resolution B-mode ultrasound machine(Philips EPIQ7) by an experienced sonographer blinded to all clinical information using a30-MHz linear vascular probe (Philips L12-3 broadband linear array transducer). The CIMT willbe measured offline in the distal common carotid artery; bulb; and proximal internal carotidartery using dedicated software (Philips Xcelera Cardiology Enterprise Viewer Client 4). Themean and maximal IMT values of 6 arterial segments will be calculated for further analysis.Plaque is defined as a localized thickening >1.2 mm that do not uniformly involve the wholeartery. Progression of plaque is defined as an increase in region harboring plaque or numberof plaque. Reproducibility of IMT was 0.97. Total plaque area (TPA) will be measured asdescribed before. The plane for measurement of each plaque will be chosen by reviewing thevideo of the scan to find the largest extent of plaque as seen on the longitudinal view. TPAwill be recorded as the sum of the areas of all plaques in the right and left carotidarteries. Reading of the ultrasound scans obtained at baseline and follow-up will beperformed concurrently by a single reader (ITC) who is aware of the temporal order of theimages but is blinded to all clinical data. The change in TPA will be calculated bysubtracting the baseline TPA from the follow-up TPA. The intraobserver intraclass correlationcoefficient for TPA was 0.94.Coronary atherosclerosis assessment CCTA scans will be performed at baseline and 12 months256-rows multidetector CT (General Electric (GE) Revolution CT) in accordance with theprotocol employed in the ACCURACY trial; and will be analysed by an experienced radiologistblinded to clinical data (PT). Coronary artery calcium score (CAC) will be quantified by theAgatston method. The presence; site; stenosis level of plaques will be recorded. Coronaryarteries will be standardised to American Heart Association 15-segment model. Segmentinvolvement score (SIS) represented the total number of segments harbouring plaque. Lesionsrendering over 50% stenosis of the lumen will be considered as obstructive. For multipleplaques; the most stenotic one will be recorded. Voxels with attenuation less than 130 HUwill be assigned to the non-calcified volume of the plaque. For each segment; the presence orabsence of 4 coronary artery high risk plaque features will be assessed: positive remodeling;low attenuation plaque; spotty calcification; and the napkin ring sign. Positive remodelingis defined as an outer vessel diameter that is 10% greater than the mean of the diameter ofthe segments immediately proximal and distal to the plaque. Low-attenuation plaque is definedas a focal central area of plaque with an attenuation density of <30 HU. Spotty calcificationis defined as focal calcification within the coronary artery wall <3 mm in maximum diameter.The napkin ring sign is defined as a central area of low attenuation plaque that had aperipheral rim of high attenuation. Observer agreement for the assessment of coronary arteryplaque characteristics has overall been shown to be fair. Plaque volume will be measuredautomatically based on attenuation (CardIQ Xpress 2.0 Reveal; General Electic).Toxicity monitoring To monitor the possible side effect of the statin and DMARDs; completeblood count; CK; liver and renal function tests will be performed every visit. Chest X-rayswill be obtained at baseline and at the end of the study. The treating physician record alladverse events and serious adverse events and; if necessary; make treatment adjustments inaccordance with the protocol. Serious adverse events are defined as any adverse reactionresulting in any of the following outcomes: a life-threatening condition or death; asignificant or permanent disability; a malignancy; hospitalization or prolongation ofhospitalization; a congenital abnormality; or a birth defect.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Suspended,NA,2019-11-21,2019-11-26,2020-07-14,Interventional,Randomized,Treatment,Arthritis|Arthritis; Psoriatic|Atherosclerosis|Coronary Artery Disease|Myocardial Ischemia|Rosuvastatin Calcium,NA,change in CIMT over a period of 12 months between two groups; The change in carotid IMT will be compared between 2 groups.

Obtain distributions and estimates of 28-day PICU free days. Total number of patients and proportion of patients with severe pneumonia requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.<br><br>SUMMARY:Severe pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children worldwide.Mortality rates from pediatric severe pneumonia are three times higher in South East Asiacompared to the Western hemisphere. The lack of description of epidemiology; currentmanagement strategies and outcomes of children with severe pneumonia admitted to pediatricintensive care units (PICUs) in Asia is a barrier to improving pediatric critical care in theregion. The lack of a sustainable pediatric critical care network in Asia makes multinationalPICU studies challenging.Through the Pediatric Acute & Critical Care Medicine Asian Network (PACCMAN); theinvestigators aim to estimate the burden of pediatric patients admitted to Asian PACCMANPICUs due to severe pneumonia that develop pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Theinvestigators will characterize etiologies; identify risk factors associated with morbidityand mortality; and develop prognostic prediction models. The investigators hypothesize thatthere are non-modifiable (e.g.; etiological agents) and modifiable risk factors (e.g.;steroid therapy and ventilator strategies) that are associated with poor clinical outcomes.To achieve these aims; the investigators propose a prospective multicenter cohort study over24 months to recruit 2000 children with severe pneumonia. Pertinent demographic; clinical;microbiological; critical care support and management data will be collected to enable aninvestigation of the association between risk factors and clinical outcomes in thesechildren. Upon completion of this large observational study; the investigators will have arich database with detailed information on epidemiology; management strategies and clinicaloutcomes for severe pneumonia in Asian children.; The Pediatric Acute & Critical Care Medicine Asian Network (PACCMAN) is the first pediatriccritical care network in Asia. Through this network and this study; the investigators aim toprovide a comprehensive epidemiological description; clinical management and outcomes ofcritically ill children with severe pneumonia across multiple sites in Asia. Through PACCMAN;the investigators aim to collect clinical data across at least 10 countries on childrenadmitted to PICUs for severe pneumonia. Detailed data on aetiologies (not limited tovaccine-preventable pneumonia); broad age groups (not limited to a specific age group ofchildren); and specific and supportive therapies in the PICU; will allow the investigators toperform comparative analysis of important non-modifiable and modifiable risk factorsassociated with mortality and functional outcomes in a large cohort of children with severepneumonia. This sets the stage for multi-center studies to investigate the effectiveness ofintensive care therapies on the outcomes of children with severe pneumonia.The overall aim is to study the epidemiology of severe pneumonia is Asian children andcompare the effectiveness of currently employed management strategies (related to invasivemechanical ventilation; adjunct and metabolic support) on clinical outcomes in approximately2000 children with severe pneumonia admitted to PICUs across at least 10 countries in Asia.The specific aims of this study are as follows:Primary Aim: To (1) estimate the percentage of pediatric patients admitted to PACCMAN PICUsdue to severe pneumonia; (2) estimate the percentage of pediatric patients admitted to PICUsfor severe pneumonia that develop pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) priorto PICU discharge or transfer; (3) estimate the overall and PARDS-specific mortality ratesfor children admitted for severe pneumonia; (4) characterize/classify etiologies of severepneumonia according to the WHO criteria.Secondary Aim 1: Obtain distributions and estimates of 28-day ventilation free days and28-day PICU free days; estimate the proportion of patients requiring extracorporeal membraneoxygenation.Secondary Aim 2: Identify risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality rates inchildren with severe pneumonia in Asia.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2020-01-07,2020-02-11,2020-09-05,Observational,NA,NA,Pneumonia,severe pneumonia,Percentage of pediatric patients admitted to PACCMAN PICUs due to severe pneumonia.

In Chile; dementia is one of the most importantcauses of disability in elderly; corresponding nearly to 40% of cases; and the most rapidlygrowing cause of death in the last twenty years. Cognitive complaints are considered a markerable to predict cognitive and functional decline; incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI);and incident dementia. The Gero cohort is the Chilean core clinical project of the Gerocenteron Brain Health and Metabolism (GERO); whose aim is to establish the capacity in Chile tofoster cutting edge and multidisciplinary research on aging.Objective This study has two main objectives. First; i) to analyze the rate of functionaldecline and progression to clinical dementia and their risks factors (biomedical; imaging;psychosocial; and clinical) in a community-dwelling elderly with subjective cognitivecomplaint; through a population-based study. Second; ii) to build the capacity to undertakeclinical research on brain aging and dementia disorders and create Data-Bank and Bio-Bankswith an appropriate infrastructure to further studies and facilitate access to the data andsamples for research.Methods The Gero cohort aims at recruiting 300 elderly subjects (>70 years) from thecommunity of Santiago (Chile); following them up for at least 3 years. Eligible people arenon-demented adults with subjective cognitive complaint; which are reported either by theparticipant; the proxy or both. Participants are identified through a household census. Theprotocol of evaluation is based on a multidimensional approach including socio-demographic;biomedical; psychosocial; neuropsychological; neuropsychiatric and motor assessments.Neuroimaging; blood and stool sample samples are also included. This multidimensionalevaluation is carried out in a baseline assessment and 3 follow-ups assessment; at 18 and 36months. In addition; in months 6; 24; and 30; a telephone interview is done in order to keepcontact with the participants and to assess general well-being.; Objectives of the Study:The general objective of this study is to analyze the rate of functional decline (FD) andprogression to clinical dementia and their risks factors (biomedical; imaging; psychosocial;and clinical) in a community-dwelling elderly with subjective cognitive complaint (SCC);through a population-based study. The specific objectives are to determinate (i) longitudinalevolution of biomarkers measured from blood; stool and structural and functional neuroimaging(MRI); (ii) evolution of the health-related quality of life; (iii) rate of cardiovascularevents (stroke and coronary events); and (iv) mortality rates. The investigators also aim tobuild the capacity to undertake clinical research on brain aging and dementia disorders andcreate Data-Bank and Bio-Banks with an appropriate infrastructure to further studies andfacilitate access to the data and samples for research.The Gero cohort is the core clinical project of the GERO; supported by the Fund for ResearchCenters in Priority Areas Program (FONDAP) of the Chilean National Commission for Scientificand Technological Research (CONICYT). GERO is initially funded for 5 years; and its main aimis to establish a center for studying Brain Aging in Chile including basic and clinicalresearch.Methods/DesignField work during the first contactThe recruitment process considers two steps. Firstly; a lay team contacts each home todetermine the presence of eligible individuals. In positive cases; the person receives asecond visit by a trained psychologist who proceeds to check the eligibility. In case ofacceptance; the inclusion and exclusion criteria protocol are applied. If the subjectfulfills the criteria; the psychologist schedule a medical interview. Following thisevaluation; a neurologist decides if the subject fulfill the inclusion criteria of thecohort.The fieldwork is preceded by an outreach campaign (flyers; local radio advertisements; andpresentations to community-organized groups) raising awareness about the visit ofinterviewers and the relevance of participating in the study. Rates of contact and responseare monitored permanently; and the procedures around the contact and first interview arechecked in the field and also by telephone to a subsample of participants. Contact to homesis attempted up to three times on different days and hours before considering it frustrated.The fieldwork started in November 2017 and is expected to finish at the end of 2019.The lay team and psychologists involved in the first contact and recruitment receivedspecific training on their labour in the field. The lay team completed a whole week training;which included theoretical and practical elements. Psychologists received a twelve weekslength training; which covers several sessions of neuropsychological assessment; includingperformance psychology.Sample sizeThe sample size had to satisfy two criteria; one concerned with the statistical powerrequired to explore multiple associations with outcomes; and other related to the feasibilityto perform a wide range of assessments to each participant assuming costs and logistics. Bothcriteria meant a trade-off between the tolerance to uncertainty around the parameters to beestimated and the number of assessments that would be investigated throughout the study. Thefinal sample chosen was 300 participants. This number allows maintaining the integrity of theoriginal protocol and permits to test associations equivalent to an odds ratio (OR) around1.5 (Cohen's d equal to 0;22) in cases of exposition and probability of the outcome close to50%; using a significance of 5%. It is expected to follow each participant between 2 and 3years; accumulating roughly 750 person-years of follow up.Follow-up and retention strategySocio-demographic; clinical; psychosocial; neuropsychological; neuropsychiatric; motor;neuroimaging; blood biomarkers; stool; and genetic samples will be performed as baselineevaluation and every 18 months; with the exception of genetic study that will be performedonly at baseline and neuroimaging at baseline and the 36 month. Patients' health status;functionality; and involvement in the Gero cohort will be monitored every 6 months by atelephonic questionnaire.To avoid a significant attrition of the sample a set following strategies have beenconsidered: to recruit only people who have at least one person that can facilitate thecontact with him or her; it means a person who can be contacted for asking about the locationof the participant; telephone contact every six months; and domicile visit in case of absenceof contact or attending to assessment appointments. Additionally; all transport costs ofparticipants will be covered by the Gero cohort administration; as well as any food that isrequired during the days of assessment. Initially; the end of the follow up of the cohort isprogrammed for October 2022.Assessments and measurementsThe protocol considers an intensive and deep multidimensional study of factors related to theprognosis of FD and dementia development. The range of assessments includes:socio-demographic; psychosocial; neuropsychological; neuropsychiatric; motor; neuroimaging;blood biomarkers; genetic and stool samples to perform gut microbiome studies. Neuroimagingprotocol will allow assessing brain atrophy; structural and functional connectivity and whitematter lesions. Gero biological samples of whole blood; buffy coat; plasma; serum; andperipheral mononuclear cells are taken and processed according to the guidelines published in2015. Samples are stored in our Gero biobank for long-term storage at -80 Â°C or in liquidnitrogen. Stool samples will be collected using standardized kits and DNA extracted using theprotocol Q suggested by the international human microbiome standards (IHMS SOP 06 V1). Dataare recorded in an ad-hoc platform developed by bioinformatics and bioengineers personal ofGero.Data analysis planThe Gero cohort offers a unique opportunity for multiple analyses to identify; correlate andanalyze multidimensional factors related to FD and progression to dementia in elderlies withSCC.In broad terms; a descriptive of baseline measurements (either outcomes or potentialpredictive factors) will be performed. The procedure will be repeated at each measurementtime; every 18 months. Random effect models will be used for describing trajectories ofparticipant subgroups and the whole cohort according to main variables; using Markov-ChainMontecarlo procedures.The association between variables and outcomes will be explored broadly using differentmachine learning methods; such as elastic net procedure; random forest procedure; based-treemethods; and support vector machines. These procedures are suitable to lead withmulti-collinearity and also high dimensional data (e.g. the number of predictive variables islarger than the number of participants in the cohort). Interpretation of causality will beconducted using standard random effect models and eventually structural equation modeling.Missing data and loss of follow up of participants are common in observational studies;mainly in cohorts. Firstly; cases with missing data in any outcome will be explored andcompared with cases without missing data describing any pattern. Secondly; two strategieswill be followed to estimate results: (1) to analyze only cases with complete information(i.e. assuming that missing data is completely at random); and (2) imputing data according tomultivariate imputation by chained equation techniques. The analysis will be performed usingthe statistical software R.Coordination with local health servicesThe Gero cohort has been carefully design to avoid undermining the usual care of participantsin their common health services facilities. Even more; a linkage between the healthassessments provided by the cohort and the usual health care has been promoted.In cases when the cohort's assessment detects a new health condition (diabetes; depression;hypertension; etc.); participants are derived to the primary healthcare centre of theirterritory. In case of detection of a significant neurological disorder (dementia syndrome;Parkinson; etc.) the participants are directly derived to specialized care according to theirhealth district; communicating the decision to the primary health care.Primary care health centres; specialized care polyclinics and the direction of the HealthDistrict involved have been informed about the study and jointly the protocol of derivationand communication were established.Regulation of access to data/biospecimensThe access to data and biospecimens is regulated by the GERO directorate in accordance withthe local Institutional Review Board authorization.

Thecorrelation between prognosis-related MRI features and pathological features was studiedthrough artificial intelligence method; so as to provide the interpretability of imagefeatures for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients treated with minimally invasivetreatment.; The prognosis prediction of early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after minimallyinvasive treatment involves clinical decision of treatment and follow-up. Magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) has become the main approach for monitoring and following up of HCC; howeverit's difficult to predict HCC prognosis before surgery. We found the following limitationsamong previous researches: multimodal MRI using different sequences shows uncertainboundaries of HCC; which makes precise segmentation more difficult; and also leads to anadditional workload for extracting high throughput radiomics features; which are limited inquantity and repeatability. Regarding to prognosis aspect; the MRI images; clinical data; andfollow up information have not been fully exploited yet. In addition; the prognosis resultobtained by radiomics workflow is difficult to be explained and applied to clinicalapplication. Therefore; we conduct a study to solve the problems mentioned above: (1) Toexplore an effective deep learning neural network method and a pre-training model forimproving tumor segmentation accuracy. (2) To establish a method for extractinghigh-throughput multi-dimensional and multimodal MRI radiomics features related to HCCprognosis. (3) To explore a correlation between multimodal MRI based pathological featuresof early stage HCC and the results of multimodal MRI based prognosis depth network of earlystage HCC after minimally invasive treatment. Based on above approaches; we aim to establishmultimodal MRI based prognosis model of early stage HCC after minimally invasive treatmentin different clinical application scenarios guiding to clinical decision-making. Moreover; wealso aim to explore the correlation between MRI radiomics features and pathology; whichprovides theoretical foundations for the MRI radiomics based pathological researches.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Active; not recruiting,NA,2020-03-05,2020-03-09,2020-03-05,Observational,NA,NA,Carcinoma|Carcinoma; Hepatocellular,Precision medicine information processing|Lesion recognition|Feature extraction|Deep learning|Diagnosis model,Three-month recurrence.

This risk may be reduced by adjuvant systemic treatment. Due to toxicities ofadjuvant therapies the aim is to identify patients at high risk for relapse and to administeradjuvant treatment only to these patients. Thus an optimal balance between insufficienttreatment vs. overtreatment has to be found.To define these patients a prognostic biomarker test will be used in addition to conventionalAJCC staging. AJCC staging takes into account several prognostic factors. However; tosubdivide stage II melanoma patients into having a low or high risk for relapse furthermethods are needed.This clinical trial will evaluate whether adjuvant nivolumab treatment will improverelapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with stage II high-risk melanoma as compared toobservation only. The randomized approach of this trial offers the most objective method withthe least influence of bias. Since patients with stage II melanoma are usually not receivingadjuvant treatment; no patient will be undertreated in case of randomization intoobservational arm.; The NivoMela trial is a randomized; controlled; prospective; multi-center national phase IIItrial with biomarker-based risk stratification.Stage II melanoma patients having undergone surgery of the malignant melanoma will bescreened using the MelaGenix GEP score to identify patients at high risk for relapse. It isexpected; that 61% of screened patients will belong to this group.Patients with a risk score of > 0.0 (HR 1.48; 1.11-1.98) corresponding to high risk ofrelapse will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive either nivolumab as adjuvanttreatment (arm A) or observation only (arm B).Stratification factors for randomization are:1.

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to standard of care or standard ofcare with the addition of therapy with chloroquine.; Chloroquine is one of two therapeutics (in addition to remdesivir) that has demonstrated invitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 and the drug is immediately available from nationalpharmacies. No delay is accordingly expected in treatment initiation after studycommencement. In light of the evidence supporting chloroquine as a promising therapeutic inpatients with COVID-19; the expected impact of the current proposal is considerable both inthe short- and long-term. If successful; treatment with chloroquine has the potential to bethe first evidence based treatment for COVID-19. The drug is affordable and the risk of sideeffects is low; making it an attractive therapeutic in large proportions of the population ona global scale.In the current proposal aims to investigate the virological and clinical effects ofchloroquine treatment in patients with established SARS-CoV-2 in need of hospital admission.The investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine in patients withestablished COVID-19 is safe and will significantly improve prognosis and impact clinicaloutcomes. More specifically; the investigators hypothesize that early treatment withchloroquine will increase the virological clearance rate of SARS-CoV-2; and lead to morerapid resolve of clinical symptoms; decreased proportion of patients with clinicaldeterioration and a decreased admission rate to intensive care units and in-hospitalmortality. Considering the immediate and worldwide health emergency associated with theSARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the current lack of evidence based medical interventions for thispatient group; studies investigating such possible treatment modalities in COVID-19 aredirely needed.The study is a two-arm; open label; pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed toassess the virological and clinical effect of chloroquine therapy in patients withestablished COVID-19. Pragmatic clinical trials are characterized by focus on informingdecision-makers on optimal clinical medicine practice and an intent to streamline proceduresand data collection in the trial. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals(physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice); pragmatic clinical trials can include alarger number of patients at a short time duration and at a lower cost. Due to the immediateneed for study commencement and the time frame of the current proposal; a pragmatic approachwill enable swift initiation of randomization and treatment. Data will be extracted from thedata warehouse at Akershus University Hospital for eligible patient identification (i.e.electronic surveillance) and for automatic data extraction to the study specific database.The study will not be able to procure an acceptable placebo treatment and the study willaccordingly not be placebo-controlled.All patients at Akershus University Hospital with suspicion of acute respiratory tractinfections are examined with a nasopharyngeal swab; with subsequent microbiologicalexamination; including SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-PCR. Participants will be recruited from theentirety of the inpatients at the participating hospitals. Electronic real-time surveillanceof laboratory reports from the Department of Microbiology will be examined regularly; withmaximum interval 24 hours; for SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects.The study aims to include patients by a sequential adaptive approach; where analyses areplanned after the inclusion of 51 patients; with subsequent analyses after 101; 151 and 202completed patients. All patients included in each sequence will be used for the finalanalyses of the entire study.

This Stability Measures (SM) database will allow us to usenew machine learning methods to develop and then validate algorithms that predict futurefalls; allowing for better targeting of vulnerable patients.; Recent advances in machine learning have disrupted the standard approach to assessing medicalprognosis. Our group; consisting of academic clinicians and research engineers; seeks tocreate a database of stability measures ( accelerometers; gyroscopes and altitude sensorsdata) in older adults monitores longitudinally. This Stability Measures (SM) database willallow us to use new machine learning methods to develop and validate algorithms that predictfuture falls; allowing to better targetting of vulnerable individuals.Although there have been numerous attempts to quantify fall risk in older adults usingbedside scales 7-12; no previous group has attempted to use a combination of bothaccelerometer and video measures to assess gait stability. Since these measures will becaptured in both frequently falling and infrequently falling patients; we will have SM datafor various windows of time (1; 2; 3 and 4-weeks) prior to at least 100 fall events; adataset that has never been captured before.<br><br>HYPOTHESES:1. A combination of accelerometer; gyroscope; and video data can be used to predict fallslongitudinally; first by the use of a training dataset followed by verification on avalidation data set.2. All the above sensor-based inputs can be combined as a simple; automated predcition toolto predict fall risk in older adults Current Methods of Falls Risk Assessment: Currentmethods of predicting falls in physician offices rely heavily on simple bedsidetests12-14. Although useful; all of these measures have quite low sensitivity andspecificity; with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of approximately 0.707-12.In fact; a recent meta-analysis could not identify any tool which had an optimal balancebetween sensitivity and specificity; or which was clearly better than a simple clinicaljudgment of risk of falling<br><br>METHODS:a) Subjects: i) High Risk Subjects (n=50): All subjects will be recruited from falls andgeriatrics clinics at Vancouver General Hospital. These clinics see about 2500 patients peryear and are currently used for research recruitment. Each clinic patient has gait speedmeasured; which will allow to recruit both high and low risk fallers. This test will allow usto recruit 50 subjects at marked risk for falls; providing us with prospectively gathereddataset of greater than 100 events; five times higher than any other sensor study.ii) Low Risk Subjects (n=50): In addition; we will use newspaper advertisements to recruitand then screen low risk subjects. All subjects will have a gait speed > 0.8 m/s and have hadno falls in the last year.All study patients with come to the laboratory (Gerontology and Diabetes Research Laboratory;VGH Research Pavilion) for a one hour session. Each subject will perform a 6-minute walk testduring which gait assessment will be obtained from the APDM system (Portland; OR). Inaddition there will be four video cameras (on the front; back and sides) that will measureraw video data for our gait analysis.

The end of the study is foreseen in 6 months.; Background COVID-19 can lead to a bilateral pneumonia overwhelming the lungs causing dyspneaand respiratory distress. Up to 20% of the infected population is hospitalized and 5% issubmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Up to 31% of patients in ICU develop sepsis and61% develop ARDS with a deadly outcome at ICU of 38%. While sepsis typically causes diffusevasodilation; the pulmonary vasculature resistance in ARDS is high. Although heart failure isper definition not the cause of ARDS; the resulting elevated pressures in the pulmonarycirculation affect right and left heart function.

The devices used today for measuring the vital signs have to be in physical contactwith the patients. There is an apparent risk of transferring infections from one patient tothe next (or to healthcare professionals).This project aims to evaluate a new camera-based system for contactless measurement of vitalsigns as well as an artificial intelligence (AI) predicting hospitalization or death within30 days. This particular study will evaluate the new system's ability without interferingwith standard care of the patient.; Background and aim:The vital signs are critical in assessing the severity and prognosis of infections; i.e.;Covid-19; influenza; sepsis and pneumonia. Quick and accurate triage is critical when facinga pandemic with an overwhelming number of cases (confirmed and suspected). This study aims a)to evaluate a new method for rapid camera-based non-contact measurement of five vital signs;body temperature; heart rate; blood oxygen saturation; respiratory rate; and blood pressure;and b) if an AI can predict hospitalization or death within 30 days.Methods:A method-comparison study design is used comparing each vital sign measured with the newmethod to the corresponding standard reference method. Furthermore; a cohort design is usedto follow up any hospitalization or death within 30 days. The investigated new systemconsists of a high-speed digital video camera; a digital radiometric infrared camera; LEDlights and a computer for data recording. This system faces the subject at a distance ofapproximately one meter; capturing a 30 second recording of the subject's face. First; allvital signs will be measured using one set of reference devices. Secondly the investigateddevice will record a 30 second video of the patient's face. Thirdly; and last; all vitalsigns will be measured using the same set of reference devices. A copy of the vital signreadings (using the standard reference methods) will be handed over by an investigator to theclinical professionals responsible for the subsequent medical care for each subject.Afterwards; the collected 30-second recordings will be run through specific softwarealgorithms to extract the vital signs. The results from the new camera-based contactlessmeasurement of vital signs and the outcome of the AIs prediction of risk for hospitalizationor death will not be presented in the care situation of the patient.Expected Findings:It is expected that the proposed study will show that the new method can estimate bodytemperature; heart rate; respiratory rate; blood oxygen level; and blood pressure with anacceptable agreement compared with the reference method and also estimate hospitalization ordeath within 30 days.Implications of the expected findings:Being able to measure vital signs quicker than before by using a new contactless method wouldgreatly facilitate triage of large number of patients. Also being able to predicthospitalization or increased risk for death would further improve the triage of patients.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Completed,NA,2020-05-04,2020-05-12,2020-11-30,Observational [Patient Registry],NA,NA,Coronavirus Infections,Vital signs|Pulse|Blood pressure|Respiratory rate|Oxygen saturation|Temperature,Agreement between the new camera based method and reference standard to estimate body temperature.

The most recent epidemiological surveillance curveshows that the number of new infections continues to rise; with over 230;000 new casesreported in the last 24 hours.Whilst the absolute number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 is substantial; effectivelymanaging high patient volumes is also a major challenge facing health systems; particularlyin under-resourced settings. With an estimated case-fatality rate amongst symptomaticpatients of between 1-2%; it is vitally important that health workers are able to accuratelyidentify the majority of patients at low risk for progression to severe disease. Thesepatients can be safely discharged away from the health facility ensuring the availableresources are allocated to patients most likely to benefit. If low-risk patients cannot bereadily identified; there is a real risk that health facilities in these regions will beoverrun; with consequent substantial avoidable mortality.COVID-19 has already started to hit extremely vulnerable populations in refugee camps andconflict areas. In Bangladesh; cases within the Rohingya refugee megacamps have already beenreported; and local transmission is ongoing. Such contexts already suffer from a lack ofmedical facilities and even a moderate number of COVID-19 cases will overburden existing; andproposed; capacity. Having the ability to prognosticate the need for supplemental oxygen (themain treatment available in these settings) through measurement of parameters available atthe time of arrival at a healthcare facility would strengthen the capability to identifythose patients presenting with moderate symptoms that can be safely discharged away from thefacility. Based on recent estimates; only 20% of all symptomatic patients with COVID-19develop a requirement for supplemental oxygen.Although existing prognostic scores have yielded disappointing results in patients withSARS-CoV-2 infection a number of demographic; clinical and laboratory parameters areassociated with a more severe disease course and worse patient outcomes. However; to ourknowledge; few studies have examined the performance of prognostic markers in patients who donot require supplemental oxygen at presentation. Only one of these studies includedoutpatient or ambulatory care settings and none were conducted in resource-limited settings.Hence; whether measurement of these parameters can inform the decision to safely discharge apatient away from a health facility is as yet unclear.Main research questionIn adults presenting to care with non-severe COVID-19; can subsequent need for oxygen bepredicted from parameters measured at the time of arrival at a healthcare facility?This study will evaluate several clinical and biochemical biomarkers that have beenidentified as possible predictors of deterioration in patients with COVID-19. The primaryobjective is to develop a prognostic tool combining up to four markers (including a maximumof two biochemical markers) with a high negative predictive value (NPV) for subsequentsupplemental oxygen requirement (WHO Grade â‰¥ 5). Clinical biomarkers will be limited tosimple clinico-demographic variables (for example; age; sex and duration of symptoms) inorder to ensure the tool remains as simple as possible. Biochemical biomarkers for whichpoint-of-care (POC) and/or near-patient tests are either already commercially available or inlate-stage development have been prioritised; in order to maximise the chance of translationon to the field within a time period that is useful for the current global pandemic response.The requirement for supplemental oxygen has been selected as the primary outcome: it is arelatively objective endpoint (based either on the measurement of peripheral oxygensaturation [sO2 â‰¤ 93%] or a respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute or a clinical decisionto give supplemental oxygen) and from a practical perspective is the main evidence-basedtherapeutic intervention available in such settings; but in very limited supply in themajority of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).We have identified near-patient tests for one of the priority biochemical biomarkers thathave not yet been field-evaluated in LMICs (suPAR). We will evaluate the performance of thistest under field conditions. We have selected this test for evaluation because unlike theother potential markers for which near-patient tests also exist; there is a relative paucityof field experience in tropical settings. As all biochemical markers will be measured using avalidated multi-analyte quantitative immunoassay (using the Ella platform); this study willprovide an opportunity to evaluate the field performance of these tests. If either of themarkers is found to be useful prognosticators for patients with non-severe SARS-CoV-2infection; this may facilitate a more rapid translation of the results of this study intopractice.Assumptions; limitations; and generalisabilityThe main assumption that underlies this work is that a validated; rapid; low-costantigen-based test for SARS-CoV-2 will become available in the near future. There is reasonto believe that this will be the case.Availability of such a test would allow the prognostictool developed in this study to be applied to the appropriate patient population at the pointof arrival at a health facility. Whilst the absence of such a test would undoubtedly limitthe utility of the tool; it is likely that when local incidence of patients presenting withconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds a threshold; use of the tool could be justified basedupon a clinical case definition alone. Furthermore; in order to mitigate this risk; we planto use the data collected in this study (specifically the baseline and outcome data collectedfrom participants who are subsequently confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 negative by RT-PCR) toinform exploratory simulation analyses; with the aim of customizing of the tool for use indifferent prevalence settings; thereby extending utility to different phases of the pandemic.An additional limitation of this study is that due to its single-site nature we will not beable to explore whether the performance of the prognostic markers is impacted by differenthost populations; or perform an external geographic validation of the prognostic model. Tomitigate this risk we have designed a pragmatic study that could be implemented in othersites. We are actively exploring options for conducting the study at other sites ifsufficient additional funding can be identified. We will inform and seek approval from allrelevant regulatory bodies (international and local) prior to the inclusion of any additionalstudy sites.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2020-06-17,2020-06-22,2021-09-30,Observational [Patient Registry],NA,NA,COVID-19,SARS-CoV-2|COVID-19|Prognosis|Oxygen,Clinical and biochemical prognostic markers; Identify clinical and biochemical prognostic markers in adults with non-severe COVID-19.

NCT04457505,Risk Factors; Personalized Prognoses and 1-year Follow-ups of Patients Admitted to Spanish Intensive Care Units Due to COVID-19; One Year Follow-ups of Patients Admitted to Spanish Intensive Care Units Due to COVID-19,,clintrials,<br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:One year mortality. Six month mortality; People who died after one year of follow up People who died after one year of follow up<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:The latest epidemiological data published from Chine reports that up to 30% ofhospital-admitted patients required admission to intensive care units (ICU). The cause forICU admission for most patients is very severe respiratory failure; 80% of the patientspresent with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) that requires protectivemechanical ventilation.Five percent of patients with SARS require extracorporeal circulation (ECMO) techniques.Global mortality data has been thus far reported in different individual publications fromChina. Without accounting for those patients still admitted to hospital; bona fideinformation (from a hospital in Wuhan) received by the PI of this project estimates thatmortality of hospitalized patients is more than 10%. Evidently; mortality is concentrated inpatients admitted to the ICU and those patients who require mechanical ventilation andpresent with SARS. As data in China was globally reported; risk factors and prognosis ofpatients with and without SARS who require mechanical ventilation are not definitively known.The efficacy of different treatments administered empirically or based on small; observationstudies is also not known. With many still admitted at the time of publication; a recentstudy in JAMA about 1500 patients admitted to the ICU in the region of Lombardy (Italy)reported a crude mortality rate of 25%. The data published until the current date is merelyobservational; prospective or retrospective. Data has not been recorded by analysis performedwith artificial intelligence (machine learning) in order to report much more personalizedresults. Furthermore; as it concerns patients admitted to the ICU who survive; respiratoryand cardiovascular consequences; as well as quality of living are completely unknown.The study further aims to investigate quality of life and different respiratory andcardiovascular outcomes at 6 months; as well as crude mortality within 1 year after dischargeof patients with COVID-19 who survive following ICU admission. Lastly; with the objective tohelp personalize treatment in accordance with altered biological pathways in each patient;two types of studies will be performed: 1) epigenetics and 2) predictive enrichment ofbiomarkers in plasma.Hypothesis-A significant percentage of patients (20%) admitted to the hospital with COVID-19infection is expected to require ICU admission; and need mechanical ventilation (80%)and; in a minor percentage (5%); ECMO.-Patients who survive an acute episode during ICU hospitalization will have a yearlyaccumulated mortality of 40%. Those who then survive will have respiratory consequences;cardiovascular complications and poor quality of life (6 months).; Objective and Purpose of Study1. The main objective is to determine risks factors and prognosis of patients with COVID-19infection who have been admitted to Spanish ICUs between the beginning and end of thepandemic in Spain. Special attention will be placed on identifying differentialexpression of prognostic factors based on sex.2. The second objective is to perform a follow-up of patients within 6 months afterdischarge from ICU and hospital in order to determine mortality (including at 1-yearmark); functional respiratory and cardiovascular consequences; and quality of life.3. The third objective is to perform an epigenetic study in cases; in which a blood samplecan be drawn. The aim of such undertaking is to define molecular signatures in liquidbiopsies that can provide information regarding prognosis; and treatment monitoring andresponse to therapy.4. Lastly; predictive ability of response to therapy and mortality will be assessed from apanel of protein biomarkers that participate in key physiological pathways of thedisease's pathogenesis. This could; in turn; help select prospective treatments withgreater potential of being successful in each patient.Principal and Secondary Variables1. Prior epidemiological data of the patient2. Biological and clinical data; including treatment administered upon hospital admission3. Biological and clinical data; including treatments administered upon and during ICUadmission until either discharge from ICU or hospital; or death4. Specific data regarding artificial ventilation and ECMO since the beginning; as well assequentially; from intubation to either extubation or death5. Biological and clinical data upon hospital discharge6. Clinical follow-up of patients who survive within 6 months; including: functionalrespiratory tests; echocardiograms and surveys regarding quality of life7. Intrahospital and intra-ICU mortality will be registered at 28- and 90-day marks; aswell as within 6 months and 1 year8. 1000 blood samples will be drawn for the epigenetic study The molecular profile of anon-coding RNA (ncRNA); specifically the microRNA (miRNA) pattern in liquid biopsy; willbe analyzed. A circulating miRNA signature is closer to the phenotype than genomicmarkers and can provide information regarding epigenetic regulation; cell activation;tissue repair; and metabolic processes in addition to that afforded by clinicalpredictors and classic risk factors. miRNAs offer appropriate biochemical propertiesthat are highly stable; have a long half-life in biological samples used in clinicallaboratories (serum/plasma); can be efficiently and relatively rapidly quantified withhigh sensitivity and specificity by RT-qPCR; and can serve as a profitable tool for theassessment of risks and disease control.All of these characteristics have led distinct authors to propose the clinical application ofmiRNA in either the short or medium term.The experimental design comprises two phases. In the first approximation; a screening ofnon-coding RNA (ncRNA) will be performed in a sub-population of patients (n=200). The numberof samples surpasses the quantity recommended for this type of studies. (Schurch y cols.;RNA; 2016). A quotation will be requested for the screening of ncRNA by HTG EdgeSeq miRNAWhole Transcriptome Assay system (HTG). Using next generation sequencing (NGS); this methodallows for the quantification of 2083 human candidates. All of the procedure steps will becompleted in suitable physical locations in accordance with code OP No. 0028. All of thesamples will be prepared in accordance with code No. 0036.Screening results will be validated in the validation cohort (n=800) with RT-qPCR; agold-standard technique. The budget includes material necessary for RNA extraction (miRNeasySerum/Plasma isolation kits; Qiagen; spike-in; carrier RNA; consumables) and expressionquantification of ncRNA in biofluids (RT-qPCR miRCURY LNA Universal RT microRNA PCR Systemkits; Qiagen; endogenous controls; consumables. Studies will be carried out at the TRRM Groupfacilities in the IRBLleida. The laboratory has the necessary team and material to isolateand quantify RNA; and store reagents and samples (cold stores; freezers of 20ÂºC and -80ÂºC).9.- For the study of prognostic biomarkers; concentration of biomarkers in plasma that arekey to potentially useful drugs' mechanism of action in this disease will be assessed.

Perform a clinical audit of patient outcomes (OS; RFS; pCR rate) after new-adjuvant chemoradiation and esophagectomy; <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:In esophageal carcinoma; neoadjuvant concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (NA-CCRT) followed bysurgery is the current standard of care and ample evidence has accumulated supporting theview that complete pathological response (pCR) is a positive prognostic marker for improvedoutcomes. Predicting the probability of achieving pCR prior to neoadjuvant treatment couldpermit modification of treatment protocols for those patients unlikely to achieve pCR.Radiomics is a new entrant in the field of imaging where specific features are derived fromthe intensity and distribution pattern of pixels based on a region-of-interest (ROI). Thefeatures thus extracted can then be used for prediction modelling similar to other -omicsdatasets. Preliminary investigations examining its utility have been performed and itsapplications have thus far focused on screening and survival prediction after treatment. Dueto the multi-dimensional nature of data extracted using radiomics; Artificial Intelligence(AI) methods are ideally suited for analysing and modelling radiomic features.Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)[utilising Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)]are both part of the AI framework. In contrast to ML; DL is a new entrant and has beenutilised by some medical researchers for modelling using prediction-type algorithms. Besidessignificantly reducing the workflow associated with Radiomics-based research; featureengineering and modelling using DL are immune to the effects of incorrect ROI delineation.However; the main limitation of DL is the 'blackbox' effect; in which the underlying basis ofa CNN is not known. This has been mitigated in part by the visualisation of activation mapsdirectly on the image dataset to prove biological plausibility of predictions. Thecomparative performance of both types of modelling is also not known.Our objective is to investigate pCR probability in our study population using radiomics-basedML and AI-based modelling. We will also investigate the comparative performance of bothmodelling techniques. For DL based prediction modelling; we will attempt to providebiological plausibility on the basis of activation maps.; ,TRUE,prognostic,development,Active; not recruiting,NA,2020-07-23,2020-07-28,2020-12-11,Observational,NA,NA,Esophageal Neoplasms,Artificial Intelligence|Deep Learning|Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation|Pathologic Response|Radiomics|Radiotherapy,Develop models to predict pCR based on pre-neoadjuvant imaging modalities.

Integrated data; structural MRI data functional connections between brain regions brain stimulation models while in a natural stimulus or watching affective pictures integrated MRI data from machine learning method<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Patients with schizophrenia have a higher risk of committing violent crimes than the generalpopulation; and the relative risk of violence against others is four times higher than thegeneral population. Violence is a major public health problem because it often leads to poorprognosis; readmission and stigma in patients with schizophrenia.MRI studies on violent behavior in schizophrenia are relatively few. These studies have foundthat violence is primarily associated with dysfunction in the ventral prefrontal and temporallimbic systems. Structural MRI found that violent behavior in schizophrenia was associatedwith increased volume of white matter in caudate nucleus; left orbitofrontal gyrus and rightorbitofrontal gyrus. However; the current research results in this field are uneven; themethods are not consistent; and there is a lack of breakthrough progress; which needs to beintegrated and deepened urgently.If the violent behavior of the patients with schizophrenia could be predicted by magneticresonance imaging; it would be a revolutionary try. By doing so; the investigators canstrengthen the treatment of these patients and reduce the occurrence of violence. Based onprevious studies; the investigators believe that violent schizophrenics exhibit recognizableimaging characteristics under structural phase; resting state; negative emotional images andnatural stimuli models. Anomalies in a particular mode may be subtle and difficult toidentify; but when multiple different modes are integrated; a significant and characteristicset of imaging markers will be present. This study will use the multivariate model of machinelearning method; detection brain activation patterns under different situations amongpatients with violence. The investigators are going to study imaging biomarkers; and try topredict the possibility of onset of violence among schizophrenia patients; thus reduce therisks of violence.; ,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Not yet recruiting,NA,2020-08-13,2020-08-20,2020-08-18,Observational,NA,NA,Schizophrenia,NA,MRI testing results. resting state MRI data. functional MRI data.

Due to the lackof specific treatment; prevention is the most effective strategy to reduce delirium. Riskassessment greatly contributes to guide prevention by stratifying the risk of the POD.However; the high-quality risk assessment tools are still sparse; and the combination of riskassessment and stratified prevention has not been applied to the management of delirium aftercardiac surgery. In the previous work; we found the predictive value of preoperative cardiacfunction on POD; and found a critical value. On the basis of previous research; this projectwill learn from previous studies on risk factors of POD; and deeply explore potentialpredictors. Furthermore; we will develop and validate POD risk prediction model; and thendevelop it into a visual evaluation system. In addition; based on the theory of riskmanagement and risk assessment tools; using the concepts and methods of evidence-basedmedicine; the risk assessment system and stratified management program of POD will be formedand evaluated by expert discussion meetings. It is expected that the risk assessment systemand stratified management program constructed by this project could simply and quickly screenhigh-risk patients and carry out timely intervention; so as to reduce the incidence of POD;improve patients' prognosis and the quality of life after cardiac surgery.; ,TRUE,prognostic,development,Not yet recruiting,NA,2020-08-23,2020-08-26,2020-08-23,Observational,NA,NA,Delirium,postoperative delirium|cardiac surgery|Intensive care unit|risk assessment,Incidence of postoperative delirium; Investigators defined patients have delirium if they had at least one positive screening during ICU stay.,Severity of postoperative delirium duration of postoperative delirium; Assess by CAM-ICU-7 if CAM-ICU is positive.

These proteins; also called antibodies; are directed to previous foreigninfecting organisms; such as virus; bacteria or parasites. Patients recovering fromSARS-Cov-2 infection may develop protective antibodies which can prevent reinfection with thesame agent or similar organisms with shared molecular structures. Those antibodies may betransferred to other patients through collection of such convalescent plasma from recovereddonors and its transfusion to ill patients. In this research; the primary hypothesis is thatthose antibodies can exert passive immunization and help ameliorate symptoms from COVID-19(Coronavirus Disease 2019); resulting in higher clinical improvement rates at day 28;especially when administered early in the infection course.; This is a randomized; open-label; phase 3 clinical trial on the use of convalescent plasmafor severe COVID-19 patients. In this research; we are going to assess efficacy and safety ofconvalescent plasma in the treatment of severely compromised COVID-19 patients. Convalescentplasma will be collected from recovered COVID-19 patients; who will be recruited as plasmadonors and will be submitted to apheresis (with minimum interval of 14 days) to obtain twoaliquots of 300 ml of convalescent plasma; which will be frozen at -80 and stored at -20 to-30 degrees Celsius. Enrolled patients will be randomized based on a concealed sequentialallocation list by an independent researcher which will not be aware of patientscharacteristics; and stratified by COVID-19 severity (severe or life-threatening). There willbe two arms of study; intervention or control group; and patients will be followed up for thenext 28 days for clinical and laboratory outcomes such as improvement of disease status(measured by a 6-point ordinal severity scale); mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit(ICU) and total hospital stay period; cytokine levels (IL-6 and TNF-alfa) and severalinflammatory; cellular injury and coagulation parameters. Intervention was conceived as twoinfusions of 300 ml of convalescent plasma; 2 days apart. Control group will receive fullsupportive treatment but will not be allowed to receive other investigational drugs. Samplesize was calculated to a total of 160 patients; with a 1:1 randomization proportion betweengroups.

However; patient heterogeneity and the existenceof multiple risk prediction tools complicate the prediction of perioperative mortality. Thus;prognostic tools are developed based on the analysis of preoperative variables. Most commonlyused models are POSSUM; ACS-NSQIP; NELA and POTTER. The models have been assessed inWest-European and North-American populations; each with different prognostic value.Aim: Comparative analysis of predictive accuracy of the aforementioned risk prediction toolsin Greek population.Materials and Methods: The study is multicenter; non-interventional; prospective andobservational and includes patients undergoing emergency laparotomies of general surgery. Incases of multiple operations in one hospitalization; the first operation is included.

An intracranialhematoma; specifically an acute subdural hematoma (ASDH); is the most common injury inelderly with TBI. The surgical versus conservative treatment of this patient group remains animportant clinical and moral dilemma; since it is in most cases unclear which treatment leadsto a better outcome for the patient. Current guidelines are not based on high-qualityevidence and compliance is low; allowing for large treatment variation in both Belgium andthe Netherlands for patients with a traumatic ASDH. In addition; elderly are underrepresentedin scientific TBI literature and are therefore not included in current guidelines orprognostic models; leading to major uncertainty in (neurosurgical) decision-making for thisgroup. As participants in two large TBI research projects (CENTER-TBI; Net-QuRe); theinvestigators observe that the uncertainty regarding treatment of elderly with a traumaticASDH will not be solved by the current ongoing studies. Therefore; they recognize thenecessity of undertaking a prospective; randomized; multicenter trial on the(cost-)effectiveness of early surgical hematoma evacuation versus a conservative treatment inelderly with a traumatic ASDH.Objective: To compare the (cost-)effectiveness of early surgical hematoma evacuation versus aconservative treatment in elderly patients with a traumatic ASDH.Study design: A prospective; pragmatic; multicenter; randomized controlled trial (RCT).Study population: Patients â‰¥ 65 years with at first presentation a GCS â‰¥ 9 and a traumaticASDH >10 mm or a traumatic ASDH <10 mm and a midline shift >5 mm; or a GCS < 9 with atraumatic ASDH <10 mm and a midline shift <5 mm without extracranial explanations for thecomatose state; for whom clinical equipoise exists regarding the preferred treatment.Intervention: Patients are randomized to either early surgical hematoma evacuation (A) orconservative management on the ICU or the ward (B). In case of neurological deteriorationduring conservative management; delayed surgery can be performed. The exact neurosurgicaltechnique will be left to the discretion of the surgeons.Main study parameters/endpoints: Functional outcome after 1 year; expressed by the rating onthe Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) Nature and extent of the burden and risksassociated with participation; benefit and group relatedness: Both treatment strategies arealready used in current clinical practice as standard medical care. Therefore; there are noextra risks for patients participating in the study compared to patients outside the study.Study participation adds a minimal burden of three follow-up evaluations by visit in thefirst year (at 3; 6 and 12 months) and subsequent yearly evaluations by phone or postal untilfive years after the injury.

Themes will be identified through qualitative analysis of patient and provider feedback. We expect to elicit patient and provider beliefs; opinions and values around the scientific; ethical and pragmatic aspects of use of these models to support decision making.<br><br>SUMMARY:Approximately 20% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require intensive care and possiblyinvasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Patient preferences with COVID-19 for MV may bedifferent; because intubation for these patients is often prolonged (for several weeks); isadministered in settings characterized by social isolation and is associated with very highaverage mortality rates. Supporting patients facing this decision requires providing anaccurate forecast of their likely outcomes based on their individual characteristics.The investigators therefore aim to:1. Develop 3 CPMs in each of 2 hospital systems (i.e.; 6 distinct models) to predict:i) the need for MV in patients hospitalized with COVID-19; ii) mortality in patientsreceiving MV; iii) length of stay in the ICU.2. Evaluate the geographic and temporal transportability of these models and examineupdating approaches.1. To evaluate geographic transportability; the investigators will apply theevaluation and updating framework developed (in the parent PCORI grant) to assessCPM validity and generalizability across the different datasets.2. To evaluate temporal transportability; the investigators will examine both the maineffect of calendar time and also examine calendar time as an effect modifier.3. Engage stakeholders to facilitate best use of these CPMs in the care of patients withCOVID-19.; There has been a proliferation of COVID-19 clinical prediction models (CPMs) reported in theliterature across health systems; but the validity and potential generalizability of thesemodels to other settings is unknown. Generally; most hospitals (and systems) do not have asufficient number of cases (and outcomes) to develop models fit to their local population;and predictor variables are not uniformly and reliably obtained across systems. Therefore;pooling and harmonizing data resources and assessing generalizability across different sitesis urgently needed to create tools that may help support decision making across settings. Inaddition; since best practices are rapidly evolving over time (e.g.; proning; minimizingparalytics; lung-protective volumes; remdesivir; dexamethasone or other treatments); updatingand recalibrating these CPMs is crucially important.In the current PCORI Methods project; the investigators developed a CPM evaluation andupdating framework including both conventional and novel performance measures. Theinvestigators will use this framework to evaluate COVID-19 prognostic models in the largestcohort of COVID-19 patients examined to date; spanning 2 datasets from very differentsettings.

Extracorporeal MembraneOxygenation (ECMO) is an extracorporeal oxygenation of venous blood to eliminate carbondioxide and return to the body. It has been an important part of the rescue treatment forARDS. This study intends to explore the timing of ECMO. The main research hypothesis is thatthe appropriate timing of ECMO treatment can improve the weaning success rate and survivalrate of children with severe ARDS; it is expected to provide a basis for determining the besttiming of ECMO treatment; Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); especially those caused by severe viralpneumonia; is still an important factor in the death of children; with a case fatality rateof 55%. The treatment includes lung protective ventilation and advanced ventilation support;but the effect is still not ideal for severe patients. ECMO can effectively support therespiratory system and provide good oxygen exchange. However; the survival rate of ECMOtreatment in children with ARDS has a large bias.One of the key factors is the uneven timingof ECMO activation; which significantly affects the prognosis.This study intends to design amulti-center; prospective; non-randomized controlled trial ; through retrospective researchto find relevant factors affecting the prognosis of ECMO treatment; and to screen keyindicators related to the timing of intervention; through a prospective cohort study toscreen Good indicators and cut-off values suitable for starting ECMO ; constructing andverifying comprehensive prediction models.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Recruiting,NA,2021-01-12,2021-01-14,2021-08-02,Observational,NA,NA,NA,ECMO|ARDS|pediatric,Survival rate; The survival rate of children in 28 days after hospital discharge,ECMO weaning rate; The success of ECMO weaning is defined as the survival of patients after ECMO weaning for 48 hours,1234,1234,1234,1234,14,1,2021,blah,1234,1234,1234

This will be measured via a structured questionnaire; using visual analogue scales (VAS; range 1-10) and Likert-scales for satisfaction scores.<br><br>SUMMARY:During the Corona Virus Pandemic health care resources have become scare; and the pandemichas brought forth the need for risk stratification of patients suffering from COVID19 inorder to allocate resources appropriately. One of scarcest resources is Intensive Caretreatment; mostly related to the need for invasive ventilation or for (post) cardiac arrestcare.To identify patients for whom ICU-treatment is most successful and those for whom it would befutile; would allow for installing appropriate advanced care directives for escalation orlimitation of treatment.; Disease resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) has a high mortality rate with deaths predominantly caused by respiratoryfailure. As of 1 September 2020; over 25 million people had confirmed coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) worldwide and at least 850 000 people had died from the disease. As hospitalsaround the world are faced with an influx of patients with COVID-19; there is an urgent needfor a pragmatic risk stratification tool that will allow the early identification of patientsinfected with SARS-CoV-2 who are at the highest risk of death to guide management andoptimise resource allocation.As is apparent not only from medical literature; but also from popular media; there is a needfor risk stratification and decision aid. The problem with our current health care capacitymainly pertains to ICU-admissions. Ideally; clinicians would be able to predict who benefitsfrom invasive ICU-treatment; and who does not. Subsequently; patients for whom ICU-admissionis futile;doctors can install advanced care directives to refrain from escalation and limitthe curative treatment they receive; and rather focus on palliation. As the investigators ofthis study previously discovered; patients are not unwilling to discuss these matters. InCOVID-19 patients; three interventions seem logical to warrant special attention:ICU-admission; invasive ventilatory support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The latterbecause mortality in cardiac arrest patients with concurrent COVID appears higher than innon-COVID patients and performing CPR in patients with contagious diseases can potentiallybring harm to health care providers.Prognostic scores attempt to transform complex clinical pictures into tangible numericalvalues.Dutch clinicians in general have been particularly busy identifying and providing prognosticscores for mortality and ICU-admission. Recent reviews listed many prognostic scores used forCOVID-19; which varied in their setting; predicted outcome measure; and the clinicalparameters included. It also highlights the importance of age; something that has been asubject to political debate. Therefore; in the past months; two Dutch research groups and oneBritish group have developed two prognostic scores:1. COVID Outcome Prediction in the Emergency department:COPE (ErasmusMC; NL)2. Risk Stratification in the Emergency Department in Acutely Ill Older Patient:RISE-UP (MUMC+; NL) 3. The International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging InfectionsConsortium Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium of the World Health Organisation:4C-score (UK)In non-COVID patients; the Good Outcome for Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) score serves asan acceptable prognostic tool for the prognosis of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Todate; no prognostic tool has been developed for CPR in COVID-patients. Last April; the Dutchboard of intensive care medicine (NVIC) wrote a handbook to guide clinicians during the phaseof the pandemic where resources would be limited to none (Code Black). In this handbook theysummed up criteria in patients for whom ICU-admission would be futile or not-recommendable.Among these criteria was cardiac arrest. These criteria have however never been researched.Furthermore; although this handbook is necessary; there is no guidance for installingadvanced care directives in the current stage of the pandemic; i.e. situations which are notCode Black - situations.The aim of this study is to implement a clinical decision tool to aid clinicians inestablishing advanced care directives about escalation and limitation of treatment inCOVID-patients. The decision tool will provide two novelties: 1) A structured approach todiscussing advanced care directives with patients who need to be admitted to hospital; and 2)A comprehensive oversight of available risk scores. The decision tool will not providecut-off values or dichotomous decisions; this will be left to the discretion of theresponsible physician. The secondary goal is to evaluate the use of this decision tool interms of ICU-admissions; mortality and health care professionals' satisfaction with theimplemented decision tool.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2021-02-03,2021-02-08,2021-08-16,Interventional,Randomized,Screening,COVID-19,NA,ICU-admissions; number of ICU-admissions at baseline and after implementation of the intervention,Mortality Health care professionals' satisfaction Patient satisfaction; COVID mortality rates for hospital; ICU-mortality; 30-day and 1-year mortality.

TheETV Success Score (ETVSS) was developed in 2009 to predict the outcome of ETV in children.There is no similar tool for predicting outcome in adults.Objective: The purpose of this study is to create a prognostic model to predict the successof ETV for adult patients with hydrocephalusMethods: The study will adhere to the TRIPOD reporting guidelines and will be conducted as aretrospective chart review of all patients â‰¥18 years old treated with ETV at theparticipating centres between Jan 1st; 2010 and Dec 31st; 2018. Data collection is conductedlocally in REDCap. Univariate analyses will be used to identify several strong predictors tobe included in a multivariate logistic regression model. The model will be validated usingK-fold cross validation. Discrimination will be assesses using AUROC and calibration withcalibration belt plots.Expected outcomes: The ability to predict who will benefit from an ETV will allow betterprimary patient selection both for ETV and shunting. This would reduce additional secondprocedures due to primary treatment failure. A success score specific for adults could alsobe used as a communication tool to provide better information and guidance to patients.; Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy for Adults with Hydrocephalus: Creating a Prognostic Modelfor Success - a retrospective multicenter studyBackground:The most common treatment for hydrocephalus is a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS); to divertexcess CSF from the ventricles to be absorbed in the peritoneum. The treatment can be appliedto different aetiologies of hydrocephalus; but there is a high complication risk both shortand long term. A retrospective review of 17;035 adult patients who had undergone their firstVPS surgery for hydrocephalus; report that one third (33.4%) of the patients experienced atleast one complication; during the follow up (3.9 years); and 22% required revision. 21.4% ofthe complications occurred within the first year. Another revew of 683 adult patients; foundthat 32% experienced shunt failure; with 74% occurring within 6 months.Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative treatment option; creating a passagebetween the ventricles and the subarachnoid space; by perforating the floor of the thirdventricle. It is minimally invasive and leaves no mechanical foreign body behind; therebyavoiding many of the implant complications associated with VPS.The overwhelming majority of research on endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is conductedin paediatric or mixed paediatric/adult populations. ETV Success Score (ETVSS) was created in2009 to predict the outcome of ETV treatment in children. The ETVSS consists of threefactors: age; aetiology and shunt history. Based on these factors a score from 0-90 is given;representing the predicted probability of successful ETV outcome 6 months postoperatively.The ETVSS was tested in a mixed population of 168 patients with a mean age of 40 years (range3-85 years) and found to have inadequate discrimination with an AUC of 0.61 but goodcalibration.The ETVSS is based on paediatric populations; and the age differentiation stops after thepatient has reached 10 years. 50 out of a possible 90 points are given if the patient is morethan 10 years old; making this parameter in the ETVSS redundant when used in adults.Furthermore; the ETVSS does not include several common aetiologies for adult hydrocephalussuch as idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH); subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) andlong-standing overt ventriculomegaly in adults (LOVA). Previous shunt treatment seems to playan important role in adults as well. A review of 163 adult patients reported an overallsuccess rate of 80%; with patients treated with ETV as the primary treatment faringsignificantly better than those with a previous shunt; at 87% and 65% respectively.Radiological findings are not included in the ETVSS; and although most radiological signs ofobstruction are subjective evaluations based on the observer's experience; some quantifiablesigns have been identified. Downward bowing of the third ventricular floor has beenidentified as a strong predictor of ETV success. The bowing was measured by placing a linethrough the chiasma to the top of the mesencephalon or the mamillary bodies. Downward bowingwas defined as inferior displacement of the third ventricle floor below this line.Although there are a few studies analysing long-term ETV survival in adults; most are inpaediatric or mixed populations. The existing long-term series on adult patients show mostfailures occurring shortly after the procedure although late failures are reported. KaplanMeier curves for ETV survival have an initial steep decline; followed by a gradual fall-offbefore it seems to stabilise with few failures after a certain point. By determining thecomposition of patient characteristics these three different parts of the curve. The initialfall off is hypothesised to represent patients without benefit of the procedure andsignificant symptoms requiring early re-operation. The second group are also ineffective fromthe beginning; but present with more chronic symptomatology giving more time to evaluate theeffect before re-operation. The failures occurring in the stable part of the curve representsinitial success with a late closure of the stoma.With ETV becoming an increasingly widespread treatment for adult hydrocephalus there is aneed for a new prognostic model specific for this patient population. The ability to predictwho will benefit from an ETV will allow better primary patient selection both for ETV andshunting; reduce additional second procedures because of primary treatment failure; andpossibly prevent further unnecessary procedures.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is to create a prognostic model to predict the short-term successof ETV for adult patients with hydrocephalus.Speciï¬c aims for this research project is to:1. Identify factors associated with both success and failure of ETV in adults; to establisha prognostic model.2. Report on ETV success rates; complications and survival in adult patients at thepartici-pating centres.A success score specific for adults will improve patient selection and can also be used as acommunication tool to provide better information and guidance to patients. The prognosticmodel will be tested in a future prospective study conducted at the participating centres. Aswell as follow up on the study population in the future to report long-term outcomes.HypothesesMain hypothesis:An adult ETVSS can be created based on patient demographics; symptomatology; aetiology; shunthistory and radiologic ï¬ndings.Secondary hypotheses:-Age is still a relevant factor but has the inverse effect in adults with less successfulout-comes with older age.-Aetiology and shunt history have prognostic value but must be recalibrated to reï¬‚ect thespectrum of hydrocephalus conditions in adults.-It is possible to develop a radiological hydrocephalus classiï¬cation and scoring systemproviding additional prognostic value.-There are different characteristics in the failures occurring during the differentphases seen on the Kaplan Meier survival curve.MethodologyStudy design:The study will be conducted as a retrospective review of electronic patient charts and willadhere to the TRIPOD guidelines in the development of the prediction model. A multivariatelogistic regression model will be used to identify prognostic factors for success of ETVtreatment. This model is expected to be simplified to include only 3 to 4 strong predictorsto make it useful in daily clinical practice.Data collection and monitoring:Each of the participating centres will be responsible for the data collection in astandardised database; that will include demographic information (date of birth; sex) anddetails on aetiology (haemorrhage; infection; tumour or cyst; trauma; congenital oridiopathic); symptomatology (acute and chronic symptoms); previous shunt treatment (numberrevisions; cause of malfunction; duration of shunt treatment); radiological investigations(visible obstruc-tion or radiological signs of obstruction); surgical details (date;equipment; technique; concur-rent procedures; following procedures) complications (intra- andpostoperative; length of stay) and follow-up (at 3-12 months and most recent) All ETVsperformed at the participating centres will be entered in the database and then includ-ed orexcluded based on the below delineated criteria. Reason for exclusion will be registered; andthe in-built tools in REDCap used to uncover missing data.Oversight:Approval from the Danish Patient Safety Authority (Styrelsen for Patientsikkerhed) and TheDanish Data Protection Agency (Datatilsynet) has been granted.Definition of ETV-success Success is defined as clinical improvement at first follow up; withno further CSF-diversion procedures within the first year of follow up. Clinical improvementwill be registered based on the records from the first available follow up; but also includepatients where the ETV was deemed ineffective before the patient was discharged or where asecond procedure was per-formed during the same admission. If the patient's chart leaves anydoubt when registering if the patient's symptoms improved postoperatively; it should beregistered as not improved. If the patient receives further CSF-diversion procedures duringthe first year; the ETV is considered a failure. Implantation of ICP-monitoring equipmentdoes not render the ETV unsuccessful; un-less it is followed by CSF-diversion. Patientsundergoing repeat ETV are counted as failures when calculating the success rate; but resultsare registered in order to determine the efficacy of re-ETVs. Additional CSF-diversionprocedures will be registered for the entire observation pe-riod (beyond the first year) todetermine long-term ETV-survival.Sample size:There is no clear consensus on the required sample size for prognostic models based onretrospective data. However; the paediatric ETVSS was based on 618 paediatric patients; using70% (455) of the population for the creation of the model and the remaining 30% (163) forvalidation. Based on this the minimum number of patients required; is approximately 500.There is no upper limit; as more patients would give a better foundation for the predictionmodel; especially in the rarer patient categories such as iNPH or hydrocephalus caused byinfection or SAH. approximately 220 adult ETV patients have been identified in Copenhagen2010-2018. With cooperation between several centres the sample should easily meet the minimumrequired sample size and provide the necessary power to create a robust prognostic model.Approximately 250 ETVs are expected from each of the participating countries; resulting in1000 patients. The model will be tested in a separate prospective study.Statistical Analysis:Patient demographics; aetiology and shunt history; as well as complications; will besummarised using descriptive statistics. The patient's symptoms are categorised as 'improved'or 'not improved' following treatment. If the patient requires subsequent CSF diversionprocedures or fails to show clinical improvement; the ETV is considered a failure. Each ofthe proposed predictors are analysed in a univariate statistical analysis and aresubsequently included in a multivariate logistic regression model to construct a uniï¬edprediction model. Statistical signiï¬cance is deï¬ned at p<0.05. The model will be validatedusing K-fold cross validation. Discriminative ability will be assessed using AUROC andcalibration using calibration belt plots. Significant missing data will be handled usingmultiple imputation. Time to ETV failure will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves.Financial plan:As this is a retrospective chart review; limited funds are required.

Compare the performance of the artificial intelligence-based ICDIM 1 score with the performance of the NIHSS reference score; Comparison of observed correlations between ICDIM 1 and the change in mRS score before hospitalization and its value assessed at discharge adjusted for length of stay Comparison of the observed correlations between the NHISS score and this same change in the mRS score<br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:In France; stroke is the leading cause of non-traumatic acquired motor disability in adults;the second leading cause of major cognitive impairment; and the third leading cause of deathin men and women. The average age of onset is 73 years (70 years for men; 76 years forwomen). All types combined; approximately 100;000 patients are hospitalized for stroke eachyear; approximately 40;000 people die and 30;000 have serious after-effects at one year. Thespectrum of functional sequelae ranges from motor and sensory impairment to cognitiveimpairment; moreover; 30 to 50% of patients have a recurrence within 5 years.Data from the Dijon Stroke Registry showed in 2011 that only 36% of people who had a strokebetween 2000 and 2009 were symptom-free 1 month after the event; 22% of patients had mild ormoderate disability according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS); and 42% were unable to walkwithout assistance or had died. Based on 2009 self-reported data; more than one in two (51%)of those with a history of stroke with sequelae reported significant difficulty or inabilityto walk 500 meters; 45% had difficulty with at least one activity of daily living. Themortality rate was 44.7 per 100 000 persons in 2013.Cerebral infarctions (CIs) account for the majority of strokes (70-75%). In 2014; despite a12.5% decrease from 2008; hospital case fatality for CIs remained high at 9%. In 2015; thecase fatality rate was 10.7% at 30 days and 11.9% at 1 year. Thirty-day mortality aloneconcentrated nearly half (47%) of the 1-year mortality.; Data regarding the validity of poor prognostic criteria for CI are still scarce and remain ofimperfect quality; particularly because of heterogeneous populations and variable definitionsof poor prognosis. Prognostic assessment must take into account both neurological andnon-neurological elements. Biomarkers have been one of the avenues explored for severalyears. For example; hyperglycemia in the acute phase of CI is associated with a more severeprognosis in terms of survival and functional recovery; and with an increased risk ofbleeding after thrombolysis; independently of age and severity of the CI. Other biologicalmarkers have been studied; but the methodology of the studies is very variable and theirquality is moderate; which does not allow us to conclude that these markers are independentpredictive factors for the prognosis of CI. Their predictive added value on simple clinicaldata; such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NHISS) severity score and age;has not been established and their clinical significance remains uncertain.The mRS 3 months after the event is the criterion most frequently used to assess thefunctional prognosis of patients after a heart attack. However; being able to anticipate themRS at discharge from hospital; as early as admission; appears to be a major challenge inorder to adapt therapies and to choose the best care pathway as soon as possible afterhospitalization. Structured management of stroke in neurovascular units (UNV); with highlyspecialized medical and paramedical staff; has a proven benefit in preventing death anddependence. The era of precision medicine; based on the identification; evaluation;organization and analysis of a multitude of variables obtained for each individual; now holdsgreat potential for the management of CI.The deployment of a computerized patient record (CPR) in health care institutions is a realopportunity in this respect. The detailed medical data collected from the moment the patiententers the hospital and throughout his or her hospitalization could be used to construct acomposite score combining information from the patient's history; clinical data; and theresults of additional examinations (especially biological and imaging). Beyond structureddata; information expressed in textual form could also be considered using innovativeartificial intelligence methodologies.A neurovascular intensive care unit (NICU); to which a neurovascular unit (NVU) is attached;has existed within the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ) since 2006. Theinstitution currently counts more than 700 stays per year for IC management; a figure that isconstantly increasing (600 in 2016; 727 in 2019); 98% of these patients made a passage in theUSINV in 2019. In addition; the CIO was deployed from 2014 in the facility; and during 2015specifically for the Neurology-Neurovascular service. This gives the facility the opportunityto conduct a single-center pilot study to test the contribution of new data; combined withthe simple clinical data usually used; to assess the functional prognosis of patients withCI.The objective of this first retrospective work is to evaluate the interest of the dataavailable in the CIO and their processing via artificial intelligence methods to characterizethe functional prognosis of patients with a CI; at admission and then during hospitalization.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Not yet recruiting,NA,2021-03-11,2021-03-17,2022-01-20,Observational,NA,NA,Cerebral Infarction|Infarction,multidimensional score,To construct a multidimensional ICDIM 1 score predictive of the functional prognosis of patients at discharge from a hospitalization motivated by a CI.

The prognosis of this disease hasdramatically changed with the surgical replacement of the aortic valve and the trans catheteraortic valve re-placement (TAVI). The TAVI procedure is also successful in octogenarians andfrail patients. However; the evaluation before the TAVI procedure requires a high dosage ofiodinated contrast agent with; consequently; an increased risk for thyroid dysfunction. Theprimary endpoint of this study is to assess; prospectively; the incidence and the predictivefactors (underlying thyroid disease; medication; food preservative; topical antiseptics) ofhypothyroidism after a TAVI procedure. The secondary endpoint is the influence of theoccurrence of hypothyroidism after the TAVI procedure on the geriatric assessment.; Aortic stenosis is highly prevalent in advancing age. The prevalence is 2.5% at an age of 75years and 8.1% at an age of 85 years. The estimated mortality after onset of symptoms(dizziness; syncope; thoracic pain and dyspnea) with conventional medical treatment is 75%after 3 years follow up. The prognosis of this disease has dramatically changed with thesurgical replacement of the aortic valve. However; an open surgical procedure is not alwayspossible in high risk patients for anatomical reasons (sternotomy; radiation and chestdeformation) or comorbidities defined by the Euroscore and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons'risk score (STS score).Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) is becoming the standard care of patientssuffering of non-operable; high risk severe and symptomatic aortic stenosis. The TAVIprocedure is associated with immediate hemodynamic improvement characterized by a decreasedaortic valve mean pressure gradient; an improved left ventricular end systolic volume andmass; a decreased end ventricular diastolic volume and a better ejection fraction. Thishemodynamic improvement translates into better clinical outcomes. Mortality rates (2.2% and6.7% at one month and at one year) and long term stroke rate are similar after TAVI orsurgical replacement.The TAVI procedure is also successful in octogenarian and in frail patients. Consequently;patient's frailty is a growing argument to refer the patient for a percutaneous treatment ofvalve disease instead of a conventional surgical approach.The standard evaluation before the TAVI procedure comprises some radiologic studies withiodinated contrast agent (coronarography; thoracic CT scanner and the TAVI procedure itself).Furthermore; some patients require a treatment with AmiodaroneÂ® because of the occurrence ofatrial fibrillation during the procedure.A typical iodinated contrast study confers 13500 Âµg of free iodine and 15-60g of bound iodine(several hundred thousand times above the recommended daily intake). An excess of iodiumexpo-sure can lead to thyroid dysfunction:-Hyperthyroidism particularly in patients with underlying nodular thyroid disease(Jod-Basedow effect).-Hypothyroidism in patients with underlying thyroid disease or in patients who are takingmedication (lithium; amiodarone) which can lead to thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism ofiodinated contrast agent hypothyroidism is the failure to escape of the acuteWolf-Chaikoff effect.Amiodarone confers 3-21 mg iodine daily and can also lead to thyroid dysfunction particularlyin patients with underlying thyroid disease because of the failure to escape of the acuteWolf-Chaikoff effect. An autoimmune mechanism is also described.Epidemiology In our recent clinical practice (geriatric day hospital UZ Brussel); anincreased incidence of hypothyroidism in elderly patients after a TAVI procedure has beenobserved.

The PROMIS-29 assesses severity levels of symptoms and their effect on the patient's functioning; assessed over the preceding 7-day period. Patients report severity; frequency; and/or interference of toxicities. For this protocol the following 11 items will be assessed: fatigue interference; neuropathy severity and interference; nausea frequency and severity; shortness of breath severity and interference; presence of rash; itching severity; and diarrhea severity and interference over the preceding 7 days. Assesses patient-perceived cognitive deficits over the past 7 days. Facets include mental acuity; concentration; verbal and nonverbal memory; verbal fluency; and perceived changes in these cognitive functions. The extent to which cognitive impairments interfere with daily functioning; whether other people observe cognitive impairments; and the impact of cognitive dysfunction on quality of life are also assessed. The PROMIS Short Form Cognitive Function 4a is a questionnaire composed of 4 items rated on a 5 level scale; ranging from Never to Very often (Several times a day); with raw scores ranging from 5 to 20; with higher scores representing better cognitive function. In combination with the PROMIS-29; the use of this questionnaire allows the calculation of the PROMIS-Preference score; which quantifies the value participants place on different health states. ToxT is a collection of statistical codes in Statistical Analysis Software that generate plots depicting summary statistics or individual patient data over discrete timepoints; combined with longitudinal statistical analyses (repeated measures modelling; and time-to-event and AUC analyses). The relationship between the CYTOX score and the occurrence of irAE will be evaluated using area under the curve (AUC).

The PROMIS-29 assesses severity levels of symptoms and their effect on the patient's functioning; assessed over the preceding 7-day period. Patients report severity; frequency; and/or interference of toxicities. For this protocol the following 11 items will be assessed: fatigue interference; neuropathy severity and interference; nausea frequency and severity; shortness of breath severity and interference; presence of rash; itching severity; and diarrhea severity and interference over the preceding 7 days. Assesses patient-perceived cognitive deficits over the past 7 days. Facets include mental acuity; concentration; verbal and nonverbal memory; verbal fluency; and perceived changes in these cognitive functions. The extent to which cognitive impairments interfere with daily functioning; whether other people observe cognitive impairments; and the impact of cognitive dysfunction on quality of life are also assessed. The PROMIS Short Form Cognitive Function 4a is a questionnaire composed of 4 items rated on a 5 level scale; ranging from Never to Very often (Several times a day); with raw scores ranging from 5 to 20; with higher scores representing better cognitive function. In combination with the PROMIS-29; the use of this questionnaire allows the calculation of the PROMIS-Preference score; which quantifies the value participants place on different health states. ToxT is a collection of statistical codes in Statistical Analysis Software that generate plots depicting summary statistics or individual patient data over discrete timepoints; combined with longitudinal statistical analyses (repeated measures modelling; and time-to-event and AUC analyses). The relationship between the CYTOX score and the occurrence of irAE will be evaluated using area under the curve (AUC). Separate evaluations will be conducted using both cytokine levels determined both prior to ICI-based therapy and after 1 cycle of ICI-based therapy.,1234,1234,1234,1234,4,5,2021,blah,1234,1234,1234

Its preoperative assessment could thus beuseful to customize surgical treatment. Radiomics has been recently proposed to predict STASin patients with lung adenocarcinoma. However; all the studies have strictly selected bothimaging and patients; leading to results hardly applicable to daily clinical practice. Theaim of this study is to test a radiomics-based prediction model of STAS in practice-baseddataset and verify its validity and translational potentials.Radiological and clinical data from 100 consecutive patients with resected lungadenocarcinoma were retrospectively collected for the training section. As in common clinicalpractice; preoperative CT images were acquired independently by different physicians and fromdifferent hospitals. Therefore; our dataset presents high variance in model and manufactureof scanner; acquisition and reconstruction protocol; endovenous contrast phase and pixelsize. To test the effect of normalization in highly varying data; preoperative CT images andtumor region of interest were preprocessed with four different pipelines. Features wereextracted using pyradiomics and selected considering both separation power and robustnesswithin pipelines. After that; a radiomics-based prediction model of STAS were created usingthe most significant associated features. This model were than validated in a group of 50patients prospectively enrolled as external validation group to test its efficacy in STASprediction.; ,TRUE,prognostic,validation,Completed,NA,2021-05-06,2021-05-19,2021-09-03,Observational,NA,NA,Adenocarcinoma|Adenocarcinoma of Lung,Spread Through Air Space; Radiomics,Sensitivity.

Delays in thedetection of OH are associated with a failure to rescue and a dramatic deterioration inprognosis once the onset of clinically frank shock has occurred. An early alert to thepresence of OH with an acceptable rate of false-positives and false-negatives would savecountless lives. Additionally; such technology would save significant time; money and effortby allowing medical resources to be applied more accurately - the essence of precisionmedicine. An automated system would monitor currently stable patients continuously; leavingclinicians free to care for patients in need of attention.; The investigators will enroll 480 trauma patients in a no significant risk prospectiveclinical trial to 1) evaluate the performance of a Mark I prototype; 2) validate theperformance of the Phase II algorithm; and 3) re-train the algorithm to Phase III iteration.This is not a therapeutic study. The main outcome variables are non-invasive measurementsthat will be used for machine learning; not real-time patient management. The data generatedwill be used later for discovery and validation in traditional and innovative machinelearning.As a minimal risk study; there will be no change from standard of care for patientsundergoing surgery. The surgical procedures and pharmacotherapies will proceed as perstandard clinical management.Enrolled patients will undergo standard preoperative; anesthetic; and postoperativephysiological monitoring that includes:Electrocardiogram: Heart rate and electrical activity of the heart will be recorded via a3-lead ECG.Arterial Oxygen Saturation (SpO2): Pulse oximetry will be recorded using a commerciallyavailable finger pulse oximeter.Finger Photoplethysmography: waveforms will be obtained non-invasively from either the SpO2photoplethysmography or alternatively a Flashback Technologies Compensatory Reserve Index(CRIâ„¢) device.In addition to these standard physiologic measurements; as a part of the research; theinvestigators will also acquire the following non-invasive optical and impedancemeasurements. All of these devices have been previously validated as non-invasive and safe inhumans. The impedance electrodes and optical emitter/detectors will be incorporated intoeasily applied latex-free based belts that will be applied to anatomic locations along thethorax; abdomen and thigh. Application of these belts will be as soon as practical afterpatient arrival.The clinicians providing care to the patient will be blind with respect to the measurementsfrom these devices.Continuous-wave Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (CW-NIRS) Device; custom built:The device is built on an Ocean Optics FLAME USB Spectrometers; with two OSRAM 4736 NIR LEDsin plastic holders meant to be taped or strapped to the patient on the chest/torso and thighlocations. An Oceans Optics tungsten-halogen light source is used for an additional probelocation on the forehead. Probe holders are designed to collect light from surface of skin bymeans of a mirror and collimator. The device will collect data on light attenuation of musclein models of shock/trauma. The light output for all locations is below the ANSI limits formaximum permissible skin exposure.SwissTom Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) System:Name of device: Pioneer Set (Electrical Impedance Tomography System) Device Manufacturer:SwissTom AG (Parent company SenTec AG)This device monitors dynamically changing perfusion physiology. To record multiplexedimpedance signature a belt of 16-32 electrodes is placed around the thorax above the nippleline and thigh and impedances are recorded between multiple sets of electrodes.SwissTom develops a clinical EIT system that is approved for pulmonary imaging.

Neck disability index. Range of Motion. Manual muscle testing for strength of cervical muscle; The Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) is a self-reported; or clinician-administered; measurement tool consisting of a numerical point scale with extreme anchors of 'no pain' to 'extreme pain. The scale is typically set up on a horizontal or vertical line; ranges most commonly from 0-10 or 0-100; and can be administered in written or verbal form. The patient is asked to rate his/her pain intensity and a particular time frame or descriptor is established (e.g. within the last 24 h; today; worst pain; average pain; or least pain). The NPRS scores are high on ease of administration and simplicity for scoring. The last reading will be taken when the NPRS score will be less than 3. The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a 10-item questionnaire that measures a patient's self-reported neck pain-related disability. The NDI is the most widely used; translated and oldest questionnaire for neck pain. Questions include activities of daily living; such as personal care; lifting; reading; work; driving; sleeping; recreational activities; pain intensity; concentration and headache. Each question is measured on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 5; and an overall score out of 100 is calculated by adding each item score together and multiplying it by two. A higher NDI score means the greater a patient's perceived disability due to neck pain. The minimally clinically important change by patients has been found to be 5 or 10%. The last reading will be taken when the NPRS score will be less than 3. Goniometric measurements are used by physical therapists to quantify baseline limitations of motion; decide on appropriate therapeutic interventions; and document the effectiveness of these interventions. Goniometry can be considered a fundamental part of the basic science of physical therapy. To most physical therapists; however; the universal goniometer (i.e. full-circle manual goniometer) remains the most versatile and widely used instrument in clinical practice. The last reading will be taken when the NPRS score will be less than 3. Medical Research Council Manual Muscle Testing scale is the most commonly accepted method of evaluating muscle strength. This method involves testing key muscles from the upper and lower extremities against the examiner's resistance and grading the patient's strength on a 0 to 5 scale accordingly; 0 means no muscle activation; 1 means trace muscle activation; such as a twitch; without achieving full Range of Motion (ROM); 2 means muscle activation with gravity eliminated; achieving full ROM; 3 means muscle activation against gravity; full ROM; 4 means muscle activation against some resistance; full ROM; 5 means muscle activation against examiner's full resistance; full ROM.

The cognitive subscale assesses cognitive anxiety symptoms; such as racing thoughts and impaired concentration due to pain. The fear subscale assesses fearful thoughts and anticipated negative consequences of pain. The escape/avoidance subscale assesses behavioural responses that reduce or terminate pain. The physiological anxiety subscale assesses physiological arousal in response to pain. Each item is rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (always). Summing each subscale provides a score that can be considered a general measure of pain-related anxiety.

Although various studies have evaluated the prognostic factors forindividual neck pain conditions or treatment; to author Knowledge; no such prognostic modelis available yet that predict the recovery in patients of sub-acute and chronic neck painwhen managed conservatively. Therefore; this study is aimed to create a prediction modelsuggesting the recovery time for neck pain.; Neck pain is a highly prevalent condition that leads to considerable pain; disability; andeconomic cost. It not only constitutes a major personal burden but also affects families; thehealth system and the economic structure of countries. Neck pain is described as anunpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissuedamage in the neck region; which starts at the superior nuchal line and continues down tothe level of the scapular spine. Acute; sub-acute and chronic neck pain is defined as neckpain with full-time sick-listing for 0 - 21 days (3 weeks); 22 - 84 days (4-12 weeks) andmore than 12 weeks; respectively. A number of studies have explored prognostic factors forneck pain. Most frequently reported prognostic factors are age; gender; pain severity; ahistory of neck pain; concomitant low back pain; duration of pain; occupation; previoustrauma; and degenerative changes on X-ray. Physiotherapy interventions for chronic neck painshowing the strongest support for an effect on pain are strength and endurance training. Twoof the most widely used treatment strategies for the management of neck pain is exercisetherapy (ET) and manual therapy (MT). ET is defined as a regimen or plan of physicalactivities designed and prescribed for any therapeutic goals; which includes strengthexercises; stabilization exercises and endurance exercises. MT may is defined as the use ofhands to apply a force with therapeutic intent. various studies have evaluated the prognosticfactors for individual neck pain conditions or treatment. but the author Knowledge; no suchprognostic model is available yet that predict the recovery in patients of sub-acute andchronic neck pain when managed conservatively.,TRUE,prognostic,NA,Recruiting,NA,2021-05-19,2021-06-14,2022-02-04,Interventional,Randomized,Treatment,Radiculopathy|Neck Pain,Prediction Model|neck pain|recovery|chronic|sub acute,Numeric pain rating scale.

Because there is no effective treatment; it isurgent to find the risk factors of ALS to guide the prevention and slow down the diseaseprogression. In the early stage of the disease; the peripheral motor injury is more rapid andsensitive than the central response; which is an ideal window to observe the state of thedisease. Protecting peripheral nerve integrity and maintaining its function can slow down thedeath of superior neurons; effectively relieve symptoms and prolong survival time; which hasalso been confirmed in patients with multiple stem cell-derived motor neurons and SOD1 G93Adisease model mice. Reexamination of the role of peripheral motor nerve related factors inthe development of ALS is of great significance for the study of disease mechanism; clinicalclassification; prognosis; evaluation of drug trial efficacy and individualized treatmentplan. Previous studies have shown that NEFL gene; as the coding gene of light chain of neuroncytoskeleton; is closely related to axonal function; and its polymorphism is related to theoccurrence and severity of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth disease.

So; the CILCA arch registrywill capture clinical data and medical images of subjects with CILCA arch treated by surgicalor endovascular (TEVAR) means.Study Design: International Multicenter and Observational registryEstimated Enrolment: 500 patients; with competitive enrolment.Clinical Follow up: Postoperatively at 30 days; at 12 months; and yearly after.; The so-called bovine aortic arch (BAA) is characterized by the presence of a common originof the innominate and left carotid artery; or; less frequently; by the origin of the leftcarotid directly from the innominate artery (i.e. type 2 BAA). In the present protocol; forbrevity and according to the STROBE guidelines the investigators employed the acronym CILCA(common origin of the innominate and left carotid artery) arch; previously employed inpublications of our group.The CILCA is the second more common arch configuration; and its prevalence in the generalpopulation is 13.6%; with relevant differences among ethnic groups. However; the realprevalence of the CILCA is likely underestimated; because its presence is largely unreporteddue to the presumed clinical irrelevance of this anatomical variant. In fact; the peculiaranatomical features associated with the CILCA mandate specific management strategies andpreoperative planning in both surgical and endovascular procedures involving the aortic arch;including type A aortic dissection repair and carotid stenting.There is increasing evidence in the literature that the CILCA represents a potentialdeterminant of the onset of thoracic aortic disease. Notably; it is associated with a1.4-fold increased risk of developing aortic aneurysms or dissections; and this entails arelevant prevalence of this anatomical variant among patients requiring thoracic endovascularaortic repair (TEVAR). In fact; the CILCA presents a consistent and peculiar anatomicalpattern compared with standard arch configuration; which provides relevant information forTEVAR planning; and may have prognostic implications.This registry aims to provide insights on the pathogenic mechanisms that expose subjects withCILCA arch to the increased risk of postoperative complications. So; the CILCA arch registrywill capture clinical data and medical images of subjects with CILCA arch treated by surgicalor endovascular (TEVAR) means.Technical and specific aims:-Development of automatic segmentation of medical images for the assessment of geometricfeatures by machine learning-Assessment of a simplified method for the calculation of the displacement forces inproximal landing zones for TEVARPrimary Endpoint: Identification of peculiar anatomical characteristics in patients withCILCA arch; before\after treatment of aortic pathologies (including both TEVAR and OpenRepair).Secondary Endpoint: Identification of anatomical risk factors for the postoperative clinicaloutcomes.REGISTRY DESIGN International Multicenter and Observational clinical registry. Enrollmentwill include 500 patients with CILCA arch; treated with TEVAR or open repair. All patientswill be followed up for 5 years; and their' clinical pathway and treatment strategy will beat discretion of the operator following current guidelines for thoracic aortic disease.FOLLOW-UP PERIOD Postoperatively; patients will be followed-up for 5 years.

In the last decade; twoeasy-to-apply prediction models for gait were developed: the EPOS model in the Netherlandsand the TWIST model in New Zealand. Although the models' performance in the developmentcohorts was good; this does not automatically mean that the models are ready for applicationin clinical practice; as it is unknown whether their performance is also good in anindependent cohort from a different country and with different patient characteristics. Suchexternal validation is an essential step towards clinical implementation of predictionmodels.A mobility-related problem is the occurrence of falls after stroke. Walking is among the Top3 activities during which stroke patients fall; with the other two activities beingtransferring or sitting in a wheelchair. Especially soft tissue injuries after a fall arecommon and in 1-15% of the patients; the fall results in a fracture. Apart from the coststhat arise from these injuries; falls have a negative impact on the patient's physicalfunctioning and psychological status; with an increased dependency and fear of falling;resulting in a reduced quality of life.A systematic review found 12 studies that developed fall risk prediction models for eitherinpatient rehabilitation stroke patients or those living in the community. Importantpredictors for falls are the presence of hemi-inattention; fall history and balance deficits.However; none of the models had an acceptable performance and predictors were not alwayscaptured by a validated assessment; which is an important prerequisite for an unbiasedprediction model.The primary aim of this study is to externally validate the EPOS and TWIST models forindependent gait after stroke in a heterogeneous sample of subjects admitted to the hospitalwith an acute stroke. It is hypothesized that the performance of both models in thisindependent cohort will be lower than in the development cohorts; but still be adequate.The secondary objective is to investigate the occurrence and predictability of falls withinthe first six months after stroke and its relationship with the prognosis for independentgait within this sample.; ,TRUE,prognostic,development; validation,Recruiting,NA,2021-08-18,2021-09-09,2021-10-19,Observational,NA,NA,Stroke,Gait|Prognosis|External validation|EPOS model|TWIST model|Falls,Functional Ambulation Categories (0-5 points; higher scores being better).

By collecting these specimens; the investigators plan to create andmaintain a biorepository to make data and specimens available to collaborating investigatorsperforming research to discover predictive biomarkers; patterns of care; and personalizedtreatments that could directly improve the care of our patients through focusedproof-of-concept clinical trials.; For brain tumors in particular; this study will provide an important historical datasetagainst which to compare the addition of novel agents to standard chemoradiation. Despiteadvancements in surgery; radiotherapy and chemotherapy; the prognosis of malignant gliomasremains poor. Even worse is the prognosis of patients with metastatic brain tumors. However;it is recognized that a small number of brain tumor patients respond durably to specificmodalities and treatment regimens and discovery of clinical; imaging; and genetic biomarkerswould significantly advance the care of these patients. The development; validation; andapplication of prognostic biomarkers for primary and secondary brain tumors that predictpatient treatment outcome and guide personalized treatment for each patient are ofconsiderable clinical importance. Such prognostic models will allow more informed;pre-treatment decisions about patient response to specific treatments and judiciously guidestratification of patients for specific treatments and enrollment into clinical trials.Prognostic models will also provide a guide and platform for studying many other types ofcancer and neurological disorders.The significance of evaluating the impact of therapy on quality of life and patient-centeredoutcomes is now widely acknowledged and recognized as one of several measures used todetermine clinical benefit. There is increasing evidence that patient reported outcome (PRO)measures are sensitive to changes in disease and treatment characteristics. For example; morerecent clinical trials for cancer are now describing the relationship between symptom-basedPRO measures and traditional clinical trial endpoints (e.g.; overall survival (OS) andprogression free survival (PFS)). The relationships between symptoms; signs; and functionsare complex; and there is a need to continue to analyze these relationships to determine whatis being caused by the treatment and what is being caused by the disease.Distinguishing outcomes of normal aging from disease is also a challenge; therefore comparingresults from patients without neurological disorders (normal controls) across the spectrumwill be an important component of the study.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2021-10-11,2021-11-04,2021-12-03,Observational,NA,NA,Brain Neoplasms|Central Nervous System Neoplasms|Nervous System Diseases,wearables|digital health|biospecimens,Specimen and data storage; To collect and store biological specimens (such as; but not limited to; tissue; blood; urine; cerebrospinal fluid; etc.); data from functional and anatomical imaging modalities; digital health data and clinical data from patients with cancer or neurological disorders; those who are under evaluation for a possible cancer or neurologic disorders; or healthy controls.,Specimen and data analysis Collaboration; To perform multi-modality analysis of specimens for biomarker discovery.

To analyze the ability of preoperative physical performance and frailty tests to predict the 1-year (mid-term) postoperative mortality; major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and the risk of rehospitalizations for cardiac reasons.<br><br>SUMMARY:Standard risk prediction models in cardiac surgery (such as EuroSCORE II or STS score) aredesigned to analyze solely the risk of short-term postoperative mortality. The postoperativemorbidity; the ability to rehabilitate or the mid-term survival are not addressed by thesemeans. Recently there have been some reports that addition of physical performance testing tothe standard prediction models may provide prognostic value. There is a wide scale of variousphysical performance and frailty tests that could be used for this purpose; but they have notbeen confronted with each other yet. Moreover; the postoperative physical rehabilitation hasnot been objectively assessed in larger scale despite the significant improvement intechnology.The hypothesisis of the study is that the preoperative outcomes of physical performance andfrailty testing are able to predict the patient's reconvalescence after cardiac surgery inthe short- and mid-term postoperatively. The aim is to analyze a set of tests with regard totheir ability to predict postoperative reconvalescence; including the objective activityassessment (using Actigraph wGT3X-BT activity tracking device). Secondarily; theinvestigators aim to follow the patients up to 1 year postoperatively in terms of evaluatingtheir mid-term outcomes.; Detailed description of testing performed in the exact order as in the patient:1. Body weight and body composition (weigth of fat; weigth of muscle) measurement usingbioimpendance scale Tanita BC 545N.2. Katz Index of Independence in Activites of Daily Living performed and assessed exactlyas described elsewhere.3. Hand-grip strength test using the Kern MAP 80K1 device. Modified Southhampton protocolwill be used for the measurement: Patient is sitting on a chair without side arms; theelbows are in a right angle. The patient is instructed to squeeze the device as much aspossible and hold for 3 seconds. He squeezes the device with the right hand; then withthe left hand. This is performed two times with each hand in total. The highest measuredvalue is recorded.4. 5-meter gait test. Patient is instructed to walk the 5-meter line as fast as possibleand the time is being measured. This is repeated three times. Average time of the threeattempts is recorded.5. 6-minute walk test. Patient is instructed to walk without interruption for 6 minutes inthe corridor of department's standard ward (exactly 36 meters long). He walks there andback repeatedly and the walked distance is calculated with regard to the number ofcorridors walked.6. During the last two tests patient is wearing a pulse oxymeter (Berry BM1000C) that isconnected with investigator's smartphone (either Android or iOS) through bluetooth.Eventual latent respiratory failure is recorded; defined as a drop in peripheralsaturation of 4 % and more; or under 88 %.7.

Early identification and accurate prognostic scores iscritical issue to improve survival rate. Loss of muscle mass and other body features; whichcan be determined from CT; have been associated with mortality in cirrhosis or hepaticcarcinoma. In this study; we sought to investigate serial changes of CT imaging parameters;such as the skeletal muscle index (SMI); liver volume; adiposity density and so forth; todevelop a new prognostic model for long-term motality in patients with liver cirrhosis. Thefinal predictive model was developed under the Cox regression framework with MELD; Child-Pughscore; baseline and serial changes of CT imaging parameters. The discrimination of the newrisk score was assessed by the overall C index.; Cirrosis; which is always manifesting as ascites; hepatic encephalopathy; uppergastrointestinal bleeding; severe jaundice and coagulopathy; deteriorates rapidly with a highmortality. Early identification and accurate predicted model may be the key to make dulyclinical decision and improve prognosis.When hepatic disorders accur; cirrhosis is often accompanied by varying degrees ofmalnutrition; which is accurately reflexed by the cross-sectioned areas of the muscles at thethird lumbar vertebra level normalized by the square of the height ï¼ˆL3-SMIï¼‰. In addition;previous studies have shown that lower density of adiposity and altered liver volume wereoften associated with adverse clinical events.These changes in body composition can be accurately assessed and measured by using CT scans.However; there is no ideas whether these imaging patameters are reliable indicators topredict the mortality of cirrhosis. In this study; we aimed to evaluate the difference ofserial changes of L3-SMI; the density of adiposity and liver volume between 5-year survivaland non-survival group and develop a new prognostic model based on these CT imaging data.This study highlighted the clinical significance of serial changes of CT imaging data inpredicting the long-term outcome of patients with cirrhosis for the first time.,TRUE,prognostic,development,Recruiting,NA,2022-01-17,2022-01-26,2022-01-17,Observational,NA,NA,Liver Cirrhosis|Fibrosis,Predict Model Computed Tomography Liver Cirrhosis Survival,Overall survival of subjects with cirrhosis; Overall survival of patients with liver cirrhosis will be summarized and compared with control subject within 5 years.,; ,1234,1234,1234,1234,26,1,2022,blah,1234,1234,1234

However; it is difficult to distinguish whetherventricular enlargement is due to hydrocephalus or other causes; such as brain injury andcompensatory brain atrophy after surgery. Therefore; it is important to predict whethershunting will help patients. For this reason; clinicians must be cautious when treatingpatients with shunt therapy. Important assessments of the level of consciousness andcontinuous lumbar tap test are currently clinically common predictors before making decisionsabout CFS shunt therapy. However; for patients with serious disturbance of consciousness; itis difficult to predict the prognosis of surgery by observing the improvement of symptomsafter lumbar tap test; which brings difficulties to the majority of clinical workers; andalso easy to bring serious psychological and economic burden to patients.In clinical practice; clinicians still lack a stable and objective method to predictpostoperative outcomes for these patients.In this clinical study; when participants performed the cerebrospinal fluid tap test toevaluate whether or not cerebrospinal fluid shunt was performed; various predictors that maybe associated with CSF shunt outcomes before and after cerebrospinal fluid tap test werecollected; including imaging data; EEG characteristics and changes in cerebrospinal fluidpressure. In addition; the researchers will collect the improvement of consciousnessdisturbance in patients with hydrocephalus before and after cerebrospinal fluid shunt; inorder to explore the correlation between preoperative imaging data; EEG characteristics; theresults of cerebrospinal fluid tap test and the improvement of consciousness disorders.

Background Development of ICIs opened a new paradigm for cancer treatment. It enableslong-term survival of patients with advanced cancers; which could not be expected to beeffective with conventional chemotherapy. Therapeutic response and prognosis to ICIs haveunique characteristics which are different from those of conventional cytotoxic or targetedtherapies. Even if the initial response rate is not high; if the treatment effect iseffective; the effect is long-lasting and enabling long-term survival. With the evaluationcriteria based on the change in tumor size; it is difficult to differentiate between anatypical response of ICIs and disease progression. Therefore; a new type of approach isrequired.F-18 FDG PET)/CT is an imaging method that is currently used for many cancers. In recentstudies on the response evaluation of ICIs using FDG PET/CT; FDG PET/CT has shown potentialas a predictive tool of therapeutic response and prognosis. However; despite the potential;most of the related studies are retrospective design and small in scale. Additionally; it isnot known which PET imaging features are suitable for predicting treatment response andprognosis.A novel image analysis method based on image informatics has been tried. After extractingimage features from imaging modalities such as PET; CT; MRI; they are fused with clinicalinformation and genetic information and analyzed through an artificial intelligence-basedplatform. It has been reported that a predictive model based on CT image features can predictthe treatment response to ICI. However; the efficacy of imaging biomarkers for predicting ICItreatment response has not yet been proven; and further prospective studies are needed.Therefore; patients with non-small cell lung cancer to be treated with ICI will receive FDGPET/CT before and during treatment in this study. In addition; PET images will becomprehensively analyzed together with other image data; biomarkers; and clinical data; andwill be used as basic data for future ICI prediction models.4.
