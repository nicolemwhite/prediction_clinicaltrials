  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An Emergency Department (ED) visit for an older adult is a high-risk medical intervention.&#xD;
      Known adverse events (AE) include delirium, prolonged ED or hospital stay, hospitalization,&#xD;
      recurrent ED visits and hospital death. These happen in a growing proportion in ED visitors&#xD;
      over age 65 are over who are represented in ED visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tools predicting AEs in the ED are of paramount importance to help decision-making on patient&#xD;
      triage and disposition. They can help identify areas of unmet needs for seniors in order to&#xD;
      develop targeted actions. Multiple scoring systems including &quot;Programme de recherche sur&#xD;
      l'intégration des services de maintien de l'autonomie&quot; (PRISMA-7), Identification of Seniors&#xD;
      at Risk (ISAR), Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), Brief Geriatric Assessment (BGA) have&#xD;
      extensively been studied in the ED and other settings for various outcomes. These tools rely&#xD;
      on a simple scoring system that minimally trained staff can reliably and quickly administer.&#xD;
      Doing otherwise is unlikely to be applicable to daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As prediction accuracy has not significantly improved in the past decade, perhaps new&#xD;
      analysis strategies are necessary. The current hype surrounding deep learning comes from&#xD;
      better and cheaper hardware and the availability of simple and open-source libraries&#xD;
      supported by large companies and a broad community of users. Hence, implementing deep&#xD;
      learning (DL) algorithms is now open to a wide range of settings, including medical care in a&#xD;
      standard clinical practice. DL has been shown to be more accurate than the average&#xD;
      board-certified specialist on very specific tasks. Prediction of various clinical outcomes&#xD;
      has produced less dramatic results, perhaps as traditional (non-DL) models already&#xD;
      outperformed clinicians for many disease states. Published DL approaches applied to outcome&#xD;
      prediction in the ED have focused on acutely ill adults in general, specific conditions or&#xD;
      administrative issues such as admitting department or ED overcrowding. None have targeted a&#xD;
      specific age group like older ED visitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important caveat to many DL approaches is interpretation of results. To develop&#xD;
      interventions based on targeted features associated with AEs in a given model, it has to be&#xD;
      somewhat transparent. If multiple layers of NNs improve prediction compared to linear&#xD;
      regression, they often provide no clinically relevant insight on how and which variables&#xD;
      interact to yield that result.&#xD;

        Between September 2017 and July 2020, 47 000 Emergency Department visits met the selection&#xD;
        criteria. Training DL models on tabular data has been shown to be less effective than on&#xD;
        unstructured sources such as images or sound. An appropriate mitigation strategy is to&#xD;
        increase the quantity of data. Hence, all participants of the ER2 database will be included&#xD;
        in the analysis. All visits will be included in the analysis.&#xD;
