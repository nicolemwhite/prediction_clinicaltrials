  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid response teams (RRTs) have been adopted by hospitals to provide urgent critical care to&#xD;
      hospitalized patients who require quick intervention to prevent further deterioration. Early&#xD;
      warning scores (EWS) serve as a method to identify patients requiring RRT assessment by&#xD;
      analyzing routinely collected data such as vital signs and laboratory results. The Visensia&#xD;
      Safety Index (VSI) is an EWS that uses continuous vital sign monitoring and machine learning&#xD;
      to identify the likelihood of deterioration and can be integrated with existing hospital data&#xD;
      infrastructure. Initial studies of the VSI have both validated the system and found that&#xD;
      patients monitored using VSI had a shorter duration of any instability and fewer episodes of&#xD;
      serious and persistent instability. The investigators' recent retrospective analysis at The&#xD;
      Ottawa Hospital (TOH) identified that implementation of an EWS could have detected earlier&#xD;
      deterioration in over half of the patients identified, potentially preventing subsequent ICU&#xD;
      admission, severity of illness, and/or mortality. Thus, this study aims to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility and potential impact of implementing a portable continuous monitoring system with&#xD;
      a VSI trigger at TOH to identify patients at high risk of deterioration.&#xD;
