  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Austrian women. Estimation of prognosis and&#xD;
      treatment strategies is increasingly being dependent on stratification of tumors into&#xD;
      different entities or classes. Currently, clinical routine stratification of tumors is mostly&#xD;
      based on hormone receptor, HER2 status, and estimation of proliferation. However, a more&#xD;
      robust and objective classification of tumors can be achieved by elucidation of further&#xD;
      biological properties, which is also of increasing significance, as novel anticancer&#xD;
      therapies are based on biological mechanisms. Consequently, available information from&#xD;
      molecular analyses is increasingly being implemented in routine diagnostic assays with the&#xD;
      aim to improve stratification for optimal treatment selection. To date the most extensive&#xD;
      molecular-based taxonomy of breast cancer has been achieved by a classification based on&#xD;
      combining gene expression and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), referred to as&#xD;
      integrative clusters. Tissue biopsies are the current gold standard to attain such a&#xD;
      classification. However, they can often be difficult to obtain in the metastatic setting and&#xD;
      are subject to sampling bias due to intratumor heterogeneity. &quot;Liquid biopsies&quot; are, among&#xD;
      other analytes, based on the analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) which contains circulating&#xD;
      tumor DNA (ctDNA), i.e. DNA fragments shed from normal and tumor cells into the blood, in&#xD;
      patients with cancer. cfDNA can be obtained minimally invasive with a blood draw, allows for&#xD;
      the &quot;real time&quot; analysis of tumor DNA from the circulation, and blood samples can be repeated&#xD;
      at any time point, which is especially important for monitoring response to therapy. The&#xD;
      investigator's group has extensive expertise in the analysis of cfDNA and has developed a&#xD;
      plethora of approaches for ctDNA analysis. Recently, the investigators have developed a new&#xD;
      approach, which relates to nucleosome positions and gene expression. cfDNA fragments have&#xD;
      been associated with the release of DNA from apoptotic cells after enzymatic processing and&#xD;
      hence consist mainly of mono-nucleosomal DNA. By performing whole-genome sequencing of cfDNA&#xD;
      the investigators could demonstrate that at transcriptional start sites, the nucleosome&#xD;
      occupancy results in different read-depth coverage patterns in expressed and silent genes. By&#xD;
      employing machine learning for gene classification, the investigators were able to classify&#xD;
      genes in cells releasing their DNA into the circulation as expressed. The main hypothesis of&#xD;
      the project is that integrative breast cancer clusters can be established from directly blood&#xD;
      without the need for an invasive tissue biopsy. Hence, the study aims include refining&#xD;
      stratification of patients for an improved selection of treatment strategies. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the investigators will obtain novel insights into the biology of metastatic breast cancer, so&#xD;
      that this project will have important implications for patients, clinical oncologists,&#xD;
      pathologists, pharmacologists, and all basic researchers interested in cancer.&#xD;

      The investigators collected 340 plasma samples from 144 clinically annotated patients with&#xD;
      detailed clinical data. All plasma samples were already analyzed by plasma-Seq, an approach,&#xD;
      which measures copy number from sequence read depth, for a first evaluation of somatic copy&#xD;
      number alterations (SCNAs). As this project represents a feasibility study, the investigators&#xD;
      want to evaluate to what extend cis-acting alterations can be determined, i.e. establish the&#xD;
      corresponding gene expression changes via nucleosome position mapping as previously published&#xD;
      by our group. The results will be corroborated by analyses of the corresponding primary tumor&#xD;
      by SCNA-seq and RNA-seq.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the 340 plasma samples the investigators selected 59 as representative for being either&#xD;
      luminal (i.e. those with amplifications at 17q23, 11q13/q14, 8p12, 8q, and gains of 16p and&#xD;
      1q; n=25), basal (i.e. gains of 8q, 10p, 12p and various amplifications occurring due to the&#xD;
      high-genomic instability; n=25), and ERBB2/HER2 (i.e. high-level amplification on 17q,&#xD;
      centered and including the HER2 gene; n=9). These samples will be sequenced with high&#xD;
      coverage (70x) so that both mutations and nucleosome positions can be extracted from the&#xD;
      obtained sequences.&#xD;
