      This will be an international, multicenter, retrospective, observational, and data-driven&#xD;
      study using secondary data captured in EHRs. The extraction of the data captured in the EHRs&#xD;
      will be performed with SAVANA's EHRead®, an innovative data-driven system based on Natural&#xD;
      Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. For all patients, the Index Date is defined&#xD;
      as the timepoint within the study period when they fulfill ALL inclusion criteria and no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Follow-up comprises the period between Index Date and the last EHR&#xD;
      available within the study period. Additional variable-specific time windows may be&#xD;
      considered to optimize data collection.&#xD;

      The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with HNSCC in a&#xD;
      real-world setting by analyzing readily available information in the Electronic Health&#xD;
      Records (EHRs). This study will gain a deep insight of the clinical characteristics and&#xD;
      real-world outcomes of patients with all stages (early, locally advanced, and metastatic) of&#xD;
      HNSCC. It will focus on developing two predictive models to apply in the clinical setting,&#xD;
      one for electing patients with high-risk of recurrence after radical treatment, and the&#xD;
      second one for selecting recurrent or metastatic patients who could benefit from&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the proposed study objectives we will use SAVANA´s EHRead® (11-15), a technology&#xD;
      that applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) (16) and machine learning to extract,&#xD;
      organize, and analyze the unstructured clinical information jotted down by health&#xD;
      professionals in patients' EHRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a predictive model based on dynamic risk stratification (DRS) for the risk of&#xD;
           recurrence or disease progression following a primary curative treatment in HNSCC&#xD;
           patients with early and locally advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a predictive model based on dynamic risk stratification (DRS) aimed at&#xD;
           identifying patients' features that predict long-term survival after immunotherapy in&#xD;
           recurrent and metastatic HNSCC patients. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe median OS by primary tumor location (oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and&#xD;
           hypopharynx) in HNSCC patients after stratification for prognostic factors, including&#xD;
           tumor stage and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment of patients with&#xD;
           HNSCC in early and locally advanced stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the patterns of follow-up in patients with HNSCC in early and locally&#xD;
           advanced stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Departments in charge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging and anatomopathological tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence detected by physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of treatments on patients with locally advanced stages of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' early and late toxicity to the treatment, comparing between radiotherapy&#xD;
           (+/-cisplatin or cetuximab) vs surgery and post-operative r&lt; radiotherapy (+/-&#xD;
           cisplatin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), including medical visits, diagnostics, and&#xD;
           hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare OS in locally advanced HNSCC patients (including both HPV+ and HPV-&#xD;
           oropharyngeal patients) treated with cisplatin-radiotherapy vs cetuximab-radiotherapy&#xD;
           and treated with surgery vs. conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of exceptional responders and&#xD;
           poor responders (based on recurrence and long-term survival). This analysis will be&#xD;
           performed independently for HPV+ and HPV- oropharyngeal patients.&#xD;
