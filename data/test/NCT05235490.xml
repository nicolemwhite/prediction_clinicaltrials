  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor recurrence, which occurs in 70% of patients with HCC within 5 years after hepatic&#xD;
      resection, is a major cause of post-resection-death. This recurrence can be true recurrence&#xD;
      (intrahepatic metastases), which occurs sooner than 2 years later, or it can be due to the&#xD;
      development of de-novo tumors at least 2 years later. Despite this high rate of tumor&#xD;
      recurrence, no anti-recurrence adjuvant therapies are currently recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging phenomics is the systematic, large scale extraction of imaging features for the&#xD;
      characterization and classification of disease phenotypes. Combining imaging and tissue&#xD;
      phenomics could be a solution to predict HCC recurrence. With the emergence of molecular&#xD;
      therapies and immunotherapies, identifying patients with HCC at high risk of post-resection&#xD;
      recurrence would help determine additional therapeutic and management strategies in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most lethal and prevalent cancers in the human&#xD;
      population and it is now the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with over&#xD;
      500,000 people affected. Because of the high recurrence rate after curative hepatectomy,&#xD;
      accurate prognostic assessment in HCC patients are quite important. With the emergence of&#xD;
      molecular therapies and immunotherapies, the identification of patients at high or low risk&#xD;
      for recurrence after hepatic resection would help determine additional therapeutic and&#xD;
      management strategies in clinical practice. Although many immunohistochemical markers have&#xD;
      been reported to have a prognostic value for HCC patients, there is no consensus on how these&#xD;
      markers could add prognostic value to the clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial step of biomarker discovery, no specific sample size is provided, however to&#xD;
      test hypothesis, 100 patients are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first study will potentially be followed by a second similar study promoted by the same&#xD;
      investigators to increase the statistical power to improve the classification tool according&#xD;
      to the patient's future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period covered by the data collection: 2011-2019 / Duration data collection: 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be built using machine learning method to obtain prediction of&#xD;
      recurrence within 2 years. The Recurrence Free survival (RFS) within two years will be the&#xD;
      reference outcome to evaluate the prognostic of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint are following :&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A secondary endpoint which will be built using machine learning method to obtain prediction&#xD;
      of recurrence after 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Recurrence Free survival (RFS) after two years will be the reference outcome to evaluate&#xD;
      the prognostic of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A secondary endpoint will be the correlation between biomarker from CT scan and&#xD;
      pathological biomarkers As the spectrum of HCC disease is very large, many patients to&#xD;
      conduct conclusive validation studies for diagnostic and prognostic relevance need to be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, each specific-read out endpoint will include a sample size calculation and - if&#xD;
      appropriate - a power analysis specific to the objective of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During training, phenotyping system performance assessment will be done to guide the&#xD;
      calculation of the sample size for the validation.&#xD;
