  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the proposed study is to validate our previously developed predictive&#xD;
      model for adults with obstructive sleep apnea using (i) clinical data from multiple large&#xD;
      academic centers, (ii) a longer follow-up period, and (iii) an extended definition of&#xD;
      outcomes of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TOH sleep database was created as a part of the project: &quot;Validation of provincial health&#xD;
      administrative data algorithms to identify patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA):&#xD;
      Feasibility project&quot;. Protocol ID: 20170591-01H (AMENDMENT APPROVED on December 19, 2018) to&#xD;
      be used for future clinical, research, educational and quality improvement purposes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the proposed study is to validate the previously developed predictive&#xD;
      model by the investigators for adults with obstructive sleep apnea using (i) clinical data&#xD;
      from multiple large academic centers, (ii) a longer follow-up period, and (iii) an extended&#xD;
      definition of outcomes of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From clinical and quality improvement perspective the TOH database will be used for&#xD;
      description, evaluation, monitoring and/or educational purposes. For example, using this&#xD;
      database the investigators will be able (i) to describe characteristics of individuals who&#xD;
      underwent a diagnostic sleep study at the TOH between 2015 and 2017 to understand better&#xD;
      clinical and health care utilization needs as well as to educate sleep fellows and&#xD;
      technologists; and (ii) to evaluate the quality of the triaging process in the sleep clinic.&#xD;
      This database will be used to: (i) examine risk factors for long-term adverse health&#xD;
      consequences (e.g. cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes, depression, dementia, depression and&#xD;
      cancer) among individuals referred for diagnostic sleep testing in order to identify high&#xD;
      risk groups that are potential targets for education and treatment, (ii) develop health&#xD;
      interventions in order to improve the quality of care and management strategies available for&#xD;
      adults with chronic diseases that are comorbid with obstructive airway diseases and&#xD;
      sleep-related disorders, (iii) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the developed health&#xD;
      interventions, e.g. screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), evaluation of home versus&#xD;
      laboratory-based diagnosis of OSA, and education strategies, (iv) develop key messages for&#xD;
      different stakeholder groups (health care providers, patients and their relatives, provincial&#xD;
      sleep and lung associations, public health managers, the respiratory vendor among others)&#xD;
      related to diagnosis, education and treatment of patients with respiratory and sleep-related&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome will be time from the index date (diagnostic sleep study) to the composite outcome of interest which include: cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes, depression, dementia, and cancer as well as chronic lung diseases and all-cause mortality. Conditions of interested will be defined from provincial health administrative data using validated algorithms that have utilized ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes as well as billing codes for outpatients visits, and procedural codes. Please see ICES Data Dictionary for details: https://www.ices.on.ca/Data-and-Privacy/ICES-data/Data-dictionary.</description>

    <measure>Health care utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>All-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalizations, emergency department visits and associated costs will be defined from provincial health administrative data. Registered Persons Database will be used to define mortality. Hospitalizations and emergency department visits will be defined using: Discharge Abstract Database (all hospital admission and discharge data), National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (emergency department visits). Please see ICES Data Dictionary for details: https://www.ices.on.ca/Data-and-Privacy/ICES-data/Data-dictionary. Total healthcare expenditures will be calculated using the ICES person-level health utilization costing algorithms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor vehicle crashes</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Different definitions of motor vehicle crashes will be considered. Motor vehicle crashes requiring hospital or emergency department visit: the investigators will identify traffic emergencies characterized as a crash using the International Classification of Diseases codes 10th Revision (V20-V69). The investigators will include emergency department visits involving crashes in which the patient was the driver of the motor vehicle and exclude emergency department visits involving crashes in which the patient was a passenger or pedestrian.</description>
