  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF) deteriorates rapidly with a high&#xD;
      short-term mortality. Early identification and accurate prognostic prediction was critical to&#xD;
      improve survival rate. This study was sought to determine the liver volumetry as predictor&#xD;
      for short-term mortality in HBV-ACLF and develop a simpler prognostic model based on liver&#xD;
      morphology. Liver volumetry were determined from CT at admission. Univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression were used to identify the optimum prognostic indicators and develop&#xD;
      prognostic model. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curves were analyzed to&#xD;
      evaluate the predictive ability of the model.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HBV-ACLF deteriorates rapidly with a high short-term mortality and early identification and&#xD;
      accurate prognostic prediction may be the key to make clinical decision and improve survival&#xD;
      rate. Liver volume, non-invasively reflects the balance of structural collapse with hepatic&#xD;
      regeneration, predicting the prognosis of liver diseases. However, there is no idea whether&#xD;
      the liver volume is an indicator to predict the mortality of HBV-ACLF patients. The present&#xD;
      study evaluated the difference of liver volume between 28-day survival group and&#xD;
      non-survivals and developed a new prognostic model based on liver volume . This study&#xD;
      highlighted the significance of liver morphology in predicting the outcome of HBV-ACLF for&#xD;
      the first time.&#xD;

        All the patients were diagnosed with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver&#xD;
        failure who met with the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. Two cohorts of subjects&#xD;
        were enrolled in several liver centers. In the modeling cohort, subjects were identified&#xD;
        retrospectively from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B manifesting as&#xD;
        hepatic encephalopathy (HE), upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, acute jaundice and&#xD;
        coagulopathy, referred from January 1, 2015 to December 31,2019. In the validation cohort,&#xD;
        subjects were enrolled from external liver centers for validating the model.&#xD;
