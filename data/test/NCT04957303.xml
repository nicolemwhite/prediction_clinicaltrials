  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Machine learning has been widely used in clinical medicine in recent years. It can be used&#xD;
      for disease classification, disease severity grading, genetic testing, image analysis,&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment recommendations, and predicting patient prognosis. Because sublingual&#xD;
      microcirculation can be used for guiding shock resuscitation, a real time automated analysis&#xD;
      is required for rapid changes of clinical condition. This study aims to use machine learning&#xD;
      to analyze the parameters and patterns of sublingual microcirculation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sublingual microcirculation videos are extracted from the 11 clinical trials conducting&#xD;
      in the National Taiwan University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, the microcirculation videos and the related information are included in a&#xD;
      de-identified manner. Each microcirculation video in the database will have a unique code.&#xD;
      The video-related data will include the patient's height, weight, blood pressure, heartbeats,&#xD;
      health status, major diseases, laboratory examination values, video quality description,&#xD;
      automated vascular analysis (AVA) 3 software analysis results including total vessel density&#xD;
      (TVD), perfused vessel density (PVD), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV), microvascular&#xD;
      flow index (MFI), and heterogeneity index (HI). The length of each micro-cycle video is 4-6&#xD;
      seconds, and there are 25 frames per second. Take a picture as a representative image, each&#xD;
      video can correspond to 4 images, and each micro-circulation image will also be marked with&#xD;
      its image quality. Machine learning model will be trained for distinguishing the quality of&#xD;
      videos and images. Only good-quality videos and images will be used for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, 80% of the microcirculation videos and images will be used for training&#xD;
      and validation to find the best model, and then the remaining 20% of microcirculation videos&#xD;
      and images will be used to test the model performance. The first training purpose is to&#xD;
      automatically distinguish the size of blood vessels, calculate TVD, and draw a histogram of&#xD;
      the number of microvessels of different diameters. The second training purpose is to measure&#xD;
      the blood flow velocity in each small vessel and calculate PVD, MFI, and HI values.&#xD;
