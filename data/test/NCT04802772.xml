  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, stroke is the leading cause of non-traumatic acquired motor disability in adults,&#xD;
      the second leading cause of major cognitive impairment, and the third leading cause of death&#xD;
      in men and women. The average age of onset is 73 years (70 years for men, 76 years for&#xD;
      women). All types combined, approximately 100,000 patients are hospitalized for stroke each&#xD;
      year, approximately 40,000 people die and 30,000 have serious after-effects at one year. The&#xD;
      spectrum of functional sequelae ranges from motor and sensory impairment to cognitive&#xD;
      impairment; moreover, 30 to 50% of patients have a recurrence within 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the Dijon Stroke Registry showed in 2011 that only 36% of people who had a stroke&#xD;
      between 2000 and 2009 were symptom-free 1 month after the event; 22% of patients had mild or&#xD;
      moderate disability according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS); and 42% were unable to walk&#xD;
      without assistance or had died. Based on 2009 self-reported data, more than one in two (51%)&#xD;
      of those with a history of stroke with sequelae reported significant difficulty or inability&#xD;
      to walk 500 meters; 45% had difficulty with at least one activity of daily living. The&#xD;
      mortality rate was 44.7 per 100 000 persons in 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral infarctions (CIs) account for the majority of strokes (70-75%). In 2014, despite a&#xD;
      12.5% decrease from 2008, hospital case fatality for CIs remained high at 9%. In 2015, the&#xD;
      case fatality rate was 10.7% at 30 days and 11.9% at 1 year. Thirty-day mortality alone&#xD;
      concentrated nearly half (47%) of the 1-year mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data regarding the validity of poor prognostic criteria for CI are still scarce and remain of&#xD;
      imperfect quality, particularly because of heterogeneous populations and variable definitions&#xD;
      of &quot;poor prognosis.&quot; Prognostic assessment must take into account both neurological and&#xD;
      non-neurological elements. Biomarkers have been one of the avenues explored for several&#xD;
      years. For example, hyperglycemia in the acute phase of CI is associated with a more severe&#xD;
      prognosis in terms of survival and functional recovery, and with an increased risk of&#xD;
      bleeding after thrombolysis, independently of age and severity of the CI. Other biological&#xD;
      markers have been studied, but the methodology of the studies is very variable and their&#xD;
      quality is moderate, which does not allow us to conclude that these markers are independent&#xD;
      predictive factors for the prognosis of CI. Their predictive &quot;added value&quot; on simple clinical&#xD;
      data, such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NHISS) severity score and age,&#xD;
      has not been established and their clinical significance remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mRS 3 months after the event is the criterion most frequently used to assess the&#xD;
      functional prognosis of patients after a heart attack. However, being able to anticipate the&#xD;
      mRS at discharge from hospital, as early as admission, appears to be a major challenge in&#xD;
      order to adapt therapies and to choose the best care pathway as soon as possible after&#xD;
      hospitalization. Structured management of stroke in neurovascular units (UNV), with highly&#xD;
      specialized medical and paramedical staff, has a proven benefit in preventing death and&#xD;
      dependence. The era of &quot;precision&quot; medicine, based on the identification, evaluation,&#xD;
      organization and analysis of a multitude of variables obtained for each individual, now holds&#xD;
      great potential for the management of CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deployment of a computerized patient record (CPR) in health care institutions is a real&#xD;
      opportunity in this respect. The detailed medical data collected from the moment the patient&#xD;
      enters the hospital and throughout his or her hospitalization could be used to construct a&#xD;
      composite score combining information from the patient's history, clinical data, and the&#xD;
      results of additional examinations (especially biological and imaging). Beyond structured&#xD;
      data, information expressed in textual form could also be considered using innovative&#xD;
      artificial intelligence methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neurovascular intensive care unit (NICU), to which a neurovascular unit (NVU) is attached,&#xD;
      has existed within the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ) since 2006. The&#xD;
      institution currently counts more than 700 stays per year for IC management, a figure that is&#xD;
      constantly increasing (600 in 2016, 727 in 2019); 98% of these patients made a passage in the&#xD;
      USINV in 2019. In addition, the CIO was deployed from 2014 in the facility, and during 2015&#xD;
      specifically for the Neurology-Neurovascular service. This gives the facility the opportunity&#xD;
      to conduct a single-center pilot study to test the contribution of new data, combined with&#xD;
      the simple clinical data usually used, to assess the functional prognosis of patients with&#xD;
      CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this first retrospective work is to evaluate the interest of the data&#xD;
      available in the CIO and their processing via artificial intelligence methods to characterize&#xD;
      the functional prognosis of patients with a CI, at admission and then during hospitalization.&#xD;
