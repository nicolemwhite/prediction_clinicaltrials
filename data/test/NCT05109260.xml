      DESTINY D-Dimer is an observational feasibility study, and a collaboration between the&#xD;
      University of South Wales and Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board (CTMUHB). The study&#xD;
      is based at St. John's Medical Practice in Aberdare, where participant recruitment will take&#xD;
      place. Blood D-dimer data will be collected from CTMUHB Pathology Laboratory services, at&#xD;
      Prince Charles Hospital. Study blood samples will be obtained by the research student, LAH,&#xD;
      under the direction of Dr Owen Thomas at St John's Medical Centre. The participant data will&#xD;
      be collected by the research student who will conduct a Wells' Risk Score and perform D-dimer&#xD;
      POC tests to generate quantitative data. Data will later be compared by the research student&#xD;
      with the diagnoses obtained from Secondary Care at Prince Charles Hospital via analysis of&#xD;
      medical records to include a laboratory generated D-Dimer results and additional diagnostics&#xD;
      (eg. Doppler).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A laboratory based analytical verification of D-dimer POC tests will be undertaken to compare&#xD;
      with the current laboratory method. The study will compare the data from the D-dimer POC&#xD;
      tests and those gained using laboratory methods at Prince Charles Hospital.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of conditions that cause hypercoagulability result in economic burden for the&#xD;
      healthcare industry. The non-specific symptoms incur clinical problems for diagnosing&#xD;
      conditions such as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a common condition in the UK, with more&#xD;
      than 140,000 patients presenting to primary care with suggestive symptoms each year&#xD;
      (Thrombosis UK, 2020). The reduction of blood flow caused by a blood clot in a deep set vein&#xD;
      can lead to a pulmonary embolism and infarcts throughout the circulation, which is&#xD;
      potentially fatal if not treated quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study would therefore be to safely exclude DVT in a primary care setting&#xD;
      using Point of Care (POC) testing as a means of reducing the number of referrals to secondary&#xD;
      and tertiary care. The use of a small protein fragment as a biomarker utilising POC testing&#xD;
      will be investigated to determine the clinical effectiveness and accuracy of ruling out DVT&#xD;
      in primary care. The current practise however relies on referral from a primary care setting&#xD;
      of all patients with symptoms of hyper coagulation, for diagnostic testing with&#xD;
      ultrasonography and laboratory generated D-Dimer analysis at secondary care. Although&#xD;
      ultrasonography is safe and easily available, it requires an additional patient visit and&#xD;
      increases the need for clinical and diagnostic resources. The use of a D-dimer POC test could&#xD;
      therefore be used to exclude a DVT at the initial presentation in the primary setting and&#xD;
      reduce the economic burden on the NHS and be more convenient for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses the conditions deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE is the third most frequent cardiovascular disease globally and&#xD;
      can be lethal in the acute phase and potentially lead to a chronic disease and disability.&#xD;
      The potential to prevent a chronic disease from developing however is highly possible with&#xD;
      the use of a rapid and reliable diagnosis. Only around 15% of patients with suspected DVT&#xD;
      will have a confirmed ultrasonography scan, with an annual incidence of 1 per 1000 (Wells,&#xD;
      Anderson and Rodger, 2004). Using ultrasonography to diagnose DVT is reliable, although&#xD;
      currently the only recognised method post initial assessment. A more precise diagnosis at&#xD;
      primary care can reduce a large percentage of ultrasound referrals to secondary care with an&#xD;
      advantage to both patients, clinical staff and efficiencies within the health care service,&#xD;
      keeping patients and their care in the primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-dimer is a small protein fragment that is the result of endogenous fibrinolysis and can be&#xD;
      found in healthy individuals in negligible amounts of around 100-200ng/ml (Lippi, Bonfanti,&#xD;
      Saccenti and Cervellin, 2014). D -dimer can be detected using monoclonal antibody immunoassay&#xD;
      based lab methods as the current method in practice. Current problems faced using D-dimer as&#xD;
      a diagnostic biomarker are that it is highly non-specific. D-dimer levels may rise in&#xD;
      conjunction with many other conditions such as cellulitis, inflammation, liver conditions and&#xD;
      in pregnancy (Wells, Anderson and Rodger, 2004). D-dimer therefore cannot solely be used to&#xD;
      diagnose a venous thromboembolism (VTE), further imaging testing (ultrasonography) would&#xD;
      likely be needed to confirm or exclude. However, a negative test is useful as it is allows&#xD;
      clinicians to reliably exclude VTE on the basis that clinical probability is low (Lippi,&#xD;
      Bonfanti, Saccenti and Cervellin, 2014). Clinical probability has been generated for DVT&#xD;
      using a points scoring 'decision rule' to categorise risk variables in order to reduce&#xD;
      referrals to secondary care for a D-dimer laboratory test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two main points scoring rule systems currently in place are the Wells Rule and Primary&#xD;
      Care Rule. The Wells Rule combines patient history and a physical examination which is&#xD;
      followed by a D-dimer assay to determine patients for ultrasonography. Clinicians are able to&#xD;
      risk stratify patients of a low risk score (Wells Score &lt;2) and a negative D-dimer to be&#xD;
      excluded from ultrasonography (van der Velde et al., 2011). A 2006 study concluded that&#xD;
      patients with a low clinical probability have prevalence of DVT &gt;5%, suggesting the Wells&#xD;
      Rule is capable of categorising patients with low, moderate and high probability (Plüddemann&#xD;
      et al., 2012). However, the Wells Rule has been criticised for its inaccuracies with&#xD;
      prevalence of thrombosis in as many as 2.9% of patients in primary care and with a normal&#xD;
      D-dimer (Antovic et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncertainties surrounding the Wells Score Rule led to the development of the Primary Care&#xD;
      Rule. The only difference from the Wells Scoring Rule, being that it does not include the&#xD;
      estimated probability of an alternative diagnosis. Analysis of data from a study of 1086&#xD;
      patients using both scorings systems in conjunction with a D-dimer POC test revealed that a&#xD;
      thromboembolic event occurred in follow up of a negative D-dimer and low risk score in both&#xD;
      Wells Rule (1.6%) and Primary Care Rule (1.4%) (Plüddemann et al., 2012). The results of this&#xD;
      study suggests a thromboembolic event cold be ruled out safely with either decision rule in&#xD;
      combination with D-dimer POC test at rates comparable to ultrasonography. The Primary Care&#xD;
      Rule has also been praised as a robust rule as adding external variables or adjusting scoring&#xD;
      does not improve the efficiency or safety of the rule (van der Velde et al., 2011). Using&#xD;
      decision rules in combination with D-dimer POC testing allows a reduction of referrals by&#xD;
      approximately 50%, significantly reducing the cost of further appointments (Plüddemann et&#xD;
      al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, among other factors has a significant effect on the safety and efficiency of diagnosis.&#xD;
      The incidence of a Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) increases with age, with 450-900 cases per&#xD;
      100,000 people in ages over 80 in comparison to less than 5 amongst children (Schouten et&#xD;
      al., 2012). The use of age dependant cut-off values for a D-dimer test can improve the&#xD;
      efficiency of excluding a venous thromboembolism. Using higher cut-off values for those in&#xD;
      different age groups respectively, clinicians are able to accurately refer less patients to&#xD;
      secondary care. However, by increasing the cut-off value for elderly patients develops a risk&#xD;
      of a higher percentage of false negatives. A study conducted using age dependant cut off&#xD;
      values reported an increase of 15.3% of patients in the age bracket of 70-80 that were&#xD;
      excluded from referral, with no increase in false positives (Schouten et al., 2012). The&#xD;
      reliability of such finding should be scrutinised as the accuracy of the diagnosis directly&#xD;
      correlates with the accuracy of the reader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the Roche Cobas H 232 POC D-dimer test has been supported by a significant amount&#xD;
      of clinical data in the evaluation of D-dimer whole blood levels. The Cobas H 232 test makes&#xD;
      use of a venous blood sample to provide a quantitative test result in 12 minutes or less&#xD;
      (Dempfle et al., 2006). The Cobas H 232 test uses a handheld device, which provides&#xD;
      clinicians with immediate results and quick patient throughput. A comparative study concluded&#xD;
      that using the Cobas H 232 test reduced the use of ultrasonography by up to 29% (Schutgens et&#xD;
      al., 2003). Statistically the Cobas H 232 test is comparable to the laboratory immunoassay&#xD;
      D-dimer test. The POC D-dimer assay displayed a high sensitivity of 96.9% for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of DVT and specificity of 60.8% at a pre-specified cut-off of 500ng/ml. In comparison, the&#xD;
      laboratory D-dimer is slightly lower, with a sensitivity of 94.9% and specificity of 64.8%&#xD;
      (Dempfle et al., 2006).While using a handheld POC test prevents the transport of blood&#xD;
      specimens to secondary care, a venous blood sample still needs to be obtained. This may be&#xD;
      inconvenient for the patient and may incur unnecessary time commitments of both the patient&#xD;
      and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lumira Dx D-dimer test is a new POC test that introduces the opportunity to measure&#xD;
      D-dimer levels in capillary blood, providing quantitative results. The lumira Dx kit boast&#xD;
      the capability of producing a quantitative results in under 10 minutes (Gray, 2020). A&#xD;
      fingerpick sample would reduce the time taken for a venous blood sample be more convenient&#xD;
      for patients and clinicians. A statistical evaluation of both POC tests will be made in this&#xD;
      study and will also investigate the clinical significance of capillary versus venous blood&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergence of the recent COVID -19 pandemic has led clinicians to investigate D-dimer as a&#xD;
      biomarker of the disease. Initial data from Wuhan suggests that higher mortality can be&#xD;
      associated with a high D-dimer test result (Reyes Gil, 2020). Association of high D-dimer and&#xD;
      COVID-19 may however be non-specific. Reliability of the relationship is highly scrutinised&#xD;
      due to the low specificity of D-dimer as a biomarker and relationship with other diseases.&#xD;
      Confounding laboratory issues may also cause elevated results, such as hemolysis and lipid&#xD;
      content which would present analytical interference. However, recent studies have suggested&#xD;
      that biomarkers such as low lymphocyte count and high levels of CRP, LDH, and D-Dimer are&#xD;
      associated with the more severe COVID-19 cases (Ali et al., 2020). Further clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of the relationship between elevated D-dimer levels and COVID-19 is required to&#xD;
      confidently make a diagnosis of COVID-19, although biomarkers such as D-dimer could currently&#xD;
      be used as a subsidiary to COVID-19 diagnosis. The research does however highlight the&#xD;
      importance of scrutinising the specificity of D-dimer as a biomarker and signifies the&#xD;
      importance of developing clinically relevant cut off values as a result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-specific nature of D-dimer level elevation highlights the need for thorough clinical&#xD;
      examinations when investigating DVT's. D-dimer levels may rise in conjunction with other&#xD;
      conditions that a patient may present upon initial assessment at a GP Practice. An&#xD;
      inflammatory response is triggered in a range of diseases such as the digestive condition IBS&#xD;
      or infections such as tuberculosis. In a recent study of 205 patients utilising D-dimer&#xD;
      testing, 9 patients were diagnosed with pancreatitis and 14 patients with cirrhosis. The&#xD;
      study concludes that D-dimer levels directly correlate with CRP levels, WBC count and C&#xD;
      reactive protein levels, and are inversely proportional to lymphocyte count (Bao et al.,&#xD;
      2017). Retrospective studies such as this highlight the need for full clinical examination&#xD;
      for patients suspected of DVT. It is therefore important that the precision of the DVT&#xD;
      pathway ensures no false positive or negatives and that ultrasonography is used to confirm&#xD;
      DVT in cases of elevated D-dimer.&#xD;
