  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PARADISE study aims to develop and validate prediction tools to identify patients at risk&#xD;
      of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common abnormal heart rhythm. AF causes the heart to beat&#xD;
      irregularly and sometimes very rapidly. About 30-50% of patients develop AF after heart&#xD;
      surgery. These patients stay longer on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after surgery, are more&#xD;
      likely to develop complications and have a higher risk of dying. Avoiding AF is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some drugs, including beta blockers and amiodarone may help prevent AF if given after&#xD;
      surgery. However, these may also lead to complications (such as lung damage). It is therefore&#xD;
      important to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from these treatments (i.e.,&#xD;
      where the benefits outweigh the risks). There are existing tools designed to predict the risk&#xD;
      of suffering AF after heart surgery. However, they are unreliable and therefore not used in&#xD;
      clinical practice. A modern, reliable risk prediction tool is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PARADISE study will develop and test new prediction tools to identify which patients are&#xD;
      most at risk of developing AF after heart surgery. The investigators will focus our tools on&#xD;
      those patients who most commonly develop AF, such as those who have had surgery to repair a&#xD;
      valve or blood vessel in their heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this the investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the medical literature and assemble a panel of medical experts to create a list&#xD;
           of known factors that affect patients' risk of AF after heart surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use a large UK general practice database (CALIBER) to see whether the investigators can&#xD;
           find new risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask the expert panel to agree a list of known and new risks factors to be included in&#xD;
           the prediction tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop two new prediction tools using an existing American cardiac surgery database&#xD;
           (the Partners research Database). The first will be used before surgery, the second&#xD;
           immediately following surgery. Two models are needed as events during surgery may alter&#xD;
           the risk of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test how reliably our new tools predict which patients suffer AF after surgery, with&#xD;
           data from large UK NHS heart centres, one US Hospital (Brigham) and a UK clinical trial&#xD;
           (Tight-K).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will work with two charities (AF Alliance and StopAfib) to share our&#xD;
           results with patients and the wider public.&#xD;
