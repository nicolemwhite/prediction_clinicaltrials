  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Portal hypertension (PH) is a common complication of chronic liver disease and a major cause&#xD;
      of morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients. One of the most serious complications of&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis is esophageal varices (EV) bleeding. The hepatic venous pressure gradient&#xD;
      (HVPG) is the gold standard for detecting portal hypertension and its complications.&#xD;
      Furthermore, HVPG is the most reliable method for assessing the efficacy of treatment with&#xD;
      nonselective -blockers (NSBB), which is the preferred therapy in patients with EV who are at&#xD;
      high risk of bleeding (HRV) and as a secondary prophylaxis in the prevention of rebleed.&#xD;
      However, the HVPG is an invasive method that is not widely used and necessitates specialized&#xD;
      skills. For these reasons, clinical research over the last decade has been focused on&#xD;
      identifying non-invasive tests (NITs) capable of evaluating the PH degree and its changes.&#xD;
      The most investigated non-invasive tests are liver and splenic stiffness measurement. In&#xD;
      advanced cirrhosis, the increase in portal pressure is less dependent on intrahepatic&#xD;
      resistance to portal flow due to fibrosis progression and more dependent on extra-hepatic&#xD;
      factors such as hyperdynamic circulation and splanchnic vasodilation hence correlation&#xD;
      between LSM and PH decreases for HVPG values higher than 12 mmHg.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests in predicting response to NSBB for&#xD;
      secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleed at 6wks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive modalities in correctly predicting&#xD;
      response to beta-blockers as compared with HVPG in preventing variceal rebleed at 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of severity of portal hypertension by non-invasive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation and Cut-off values for non-invasive methods in responders and&#xD;
           non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AAR, APRI, FIB-4 index, CSPH risk score,fibrosis index, GPR, King's score, Lok score are&#xD;
           other non- invasive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation between HVPG &amp;non invasive test, responder and non-responder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison ofhypersplenism(Splenic volume and area) and hematological parameters before&#xD;
           and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis and response assessment by convolutional neural network- AI based model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prognostic implication of HVPG rebleed on EVL+beta-blockers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population:All the consecutive patients of cirrhosis admitted to Intensive care&#xD;
           unit of Hepatology department of ILBS will be evaluated for inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: Prospective observational study. The study will be conducted in Department&#xD;
           of Hepatology ILBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study period: 1.5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size: Assuming that Sn of 92%, α of 5%, Power 80, we need to have 186 patients.&#xD;
           So we decided to enroll ~200 cases (Including 5% defaulter rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HVPG done at the baseline within 5days of acute variceal bleed and at 6weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic variceal band ligation at 3rd week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NSBB started on day 6 which optimised according to heart rate and continued for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring and assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with acute variceal bleed after endovariceal band ligation will be undergoing&#xD;
           HVPG, TE to measure splenic stiffness and baseline investigations such as complete blood&#xD;
           count, liver and kidney function test, ultrasonography of the abdomen, contrast enhanced&#xD;
           computerized tomography of abdomen. These investigations will be carried out within&#xD;
           5days. After 5 days NSBB is started and is optimsed to maximum dose according to heart&#xD;
           rate and blood pressure. After 3 weeks EVL is done. After 6 weeks of NSBB, after 3weeks&#xD;
           of secondary EVL;HVPG, TE to measure liver and splenic stiffness and other baseline&#xD;
           investigations are done.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to the HVPG measurement, a venous access was performed under ultrasonography after&#xD;
           local anesthesia. The Seldinger technique was used to insert a catheter into the right&#xD;
           brachial vein or the right internal jugular vein. An occlusion balloon catheter of 6 F&#xD;
           was guided in a branch of the hepatic veins, usually the median or right vein, under&#xD;
           fluoroscopic control and continuous electrocardiographic and pressure monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After inflating the balloon at the catheter's tip (maximum diameter ranges from 8.5-11.5&#xD;
           mm), a venous check was performed to demonstrate complete vessel occlusion. The wedged&#xD;
           hepatic vein pressure (WHVP) was measured in this condition. Following that, the free&#xD;
           hepatic vein pressure (FHVP) was measured after deflating the balloon at the catheter's&#xD;
           tip. On a multi-channel recorder, a permanent trace was obtained. Pressures were also&#xD;
           achieved in the inferior vena cava and the right atrium. According to the Baveno VI&#xD;
           consensus, the HVPG-response was defined as a 20% or 12 mmHg reduction in HVPG after&#xD;
           NSBB treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HVPG= WHVP - FHVP (Normal is &lt;5mm of Hg)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Ultrasonography of the abdomen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dilated portal vein (&gt;13 mm): non-specific&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biphasic or reverse flow in portal vein (late stage): pathognomonic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recanalization of paraumbilical vein: pathognomonic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  portal-systemic collateral pathways (collateral vessels/varices)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  splenomegaly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ascites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The damping index (showing changes in the doppler hepatic vein waveform) corresponds&#xD;
           with hemodynamically significant portal hypertension and HVPG values (together with HVPG&#xD;
           changes after treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  splenic arterial resistive index&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Liver and splenic stiffness:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 3.5-MHz ultrasound transducer probe is mounted on the axis of a vibrator in the&#xD;
           FibroScan device. Mild amplitude, low-frequency (50 Hz) vibrations are transmitted to&#xD;
           the liver tissue, causing an elastic shear wave to propagate through the underlying&#xD;
           tissue.If the success rate was greater than 60% and the interquartile range (IQR) was&#xD;
           greater than 30% of the median value, LS values were accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Guidelines for measuring SS is same as LS. SS was performed on a supine patient with&#xD;
           maximal abduction of the left arm, with the probe positioned in an intercostal space&#xD;
           where the spleen was correctly visualized by US. Furthermore, in accordance with the&#xD;
           FibroScan's technical features, patients with a splenic parenchymal thickness of &gt;4 cm&#xD;
           under the probe were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Radiomics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Convolutional neural network - Deep learning using liver and splenic channels for&#xD;
           assessment of portal hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous variables are expressed as the median and categorical data as numbers&#xD;
           (percentages) (range). For group comparison, use the Mann-Whitney test for continuous&#xD;
           variables and the 2 test for categorical variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient&#xD;
           will be used to assess the linear relationship between noninvasive tests and HVPG (r).&#xD;
           Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be computed for each of the&#xD;
           diagnostic parameters evaluated (age, transaminases, platelet count, spleen diameter,&#xD;
           Plt/Spl, LS, SS, LSPS), as well as the area under the ROC curve (AUROC).For all tests,&#xD;
           p≤ 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Analysis will be performed using&#xD;
           SPSS .The analysis will be done with intention to treat and per protocol analysis if&#xD;
           applicable.&#xD;
