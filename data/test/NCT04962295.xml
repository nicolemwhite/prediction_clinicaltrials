      The purpose of this study is to build a national image-based comprehensive evaluation&#xD;
      platform of CSVD through longitudinal collection of imaging based medical data of patients&#xD;
      with cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVD). On this basis, the new classification and&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria of CSVD are proposed, and the risk prediction model of CSVD is&#xD;
      established. By evaluating the prognostic factors of CSVD, early identification of high-risk&#xD;
      CSVD population.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to build a national image-based CSVD comprehensive evaluation&#xD;
      platform by collecting the medical data of patients with cerebral small vessel diseases&#xD;
      (CSVD) based on imaging longitudinally, and to evaluate the risk factors of each type of&#xD;
      CSVD, as well as imaging signs, cognition, gait, autonomic nervous system and hemodynamics,&#xD;
      sleep, sleep, and so on The outcome of emotion and fundus. In the fields of imaging,&#xD;
      molecular and neurocognitive function, we explored the etiology and pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanism of CSVD, proposed new classification and diagnostic criteria of CSVD, and&#xD;
      established the risk prediction model of CSVD. By evaluating the prognostic factors of CSVD,&#xD;
      early identification of high-risk CSVD population, in order to reduce the burden of CSVD in&#xD;
      China in the future.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. SVD lesions can be seen on MRI of the head&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Fazekas=1 has more than 2 vascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
                  diabetes, obesity, smoking, and other vascular events except stroke).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fazekas = 1 and combined with lacunar focus&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Imaging findings suggest new subcortical lacunar infarction&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: the imaging definition of small vessel disease refers to the strong guideline&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The total score of Fazekas was 6, which was the sum of Fazekas scores of subcortical&#xD;
             and periventricular white matter lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. New subcortical lacunar infarction: head MRI examination, subcortical, basal ganglia&#xD;
             or brain stem DWI showed high signal (ADC diffusion limited) lesions with diameter &lt;&#xD;
             20 mm, with or without corresponding clinical symptoms; There were new clinical&#xD;
             symptoms. FLAIR sequence of head MRI showed flair hyperintense lesions (diameter &lt; 20&#xD;
             mm) in subcortical, basal ganglia or pons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
