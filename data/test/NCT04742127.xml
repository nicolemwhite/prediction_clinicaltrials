    <textblock>
      Septic arthritis of the native hip poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges as&#xD;
      it is considered an orthopedic emergency requiring urgent surgery. Inadequate or delayed&#xD;
      treatment is disastrous, resulting in irreversible destruction of the joint. Initial&#xD;
      treatment usually comprises of arthroscopic or open debridement. According to literature&#xD;
      25-38% of first debridement fail, requiring a second or third intervention or even a staged&#xD;
      procedure with femoral head resection and a temporary antibiotic-loaded cement spacer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding who will succeed and who will fail after a single surgical debridement of a&#xD;
      septic hip joint could improve shared decision-making and could help decide which patient&#xD;
      would benefit from resection arthroplasty straight away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to gain more insight in clinical factors associated with failure of a single&#xD;
      surgical debridement in septic arthritis of the native hip, a retrospective cohort study will&#xD;
      be conducted. There are no detailed guidelines for the treatment of septic arthritis of the&#xD;
      native hip. Therefore, treatment today is similar to treatment 10 years ago (i.e. the&#xD;
      treating surgeon does what he thinks is best for the patient). This lack of a structured&#xD;
      approach is the reason for this retrospective study and we aim to come up with principles to&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Septic arthritis of the native hip poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges as&#xD;
      it is considered an orthopedic emergency requiring urgent surgery. Early diagnosis remains&#xD;
      difficult as the golden standard is based on microbiological confirmation of bacteria in&#xD;
      synovial fluid or solid tissue biopsies, which can take up to a minimum of 3-5 days or&#xD;
      longer. Inadequate or delayed treatment is disastrous, resulting in irreversible destruction&#xD;
      of the joint. Initial treatment usually comprises of arthroscopic or open debridement. In&#xD;
      comparison to septic arthritis of the knee, patients are more often less fit and the joint is&#xD;
      less accessible for arthroscopic intervention. Initial surgical debridement should be&#xD;
      performed within 24 hours of occurrence. According to literature 25-38% of first debridement&#xD;
      fail, requiring a second or third intervention or even a staged procedure with femoral head&#xD;
      resection and a temporary antibiotic-loaded cement spacer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding who will succeed and who will fail after a single surgical debridement of a&#xD;
      septic hip joint could improve shared decision-making and could help decide which patient&#xD;
      would benefit from resection arthroplasty straight away. Factors such as a history of&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis, diabetes, a synovial-fluid nucleated cell count of &gt; 85.0 x 10^9&#xD;
      cells/L, S. aureus, delay to surgery and positive cultures of drain fluid were associated&#xD;
      with failure of initial debridement, but have not been validated. Considering the increased&#xD;
      use of MRI and nuclear imaging in the work-up of these patients, there might be additional&#xD;
      useful risk factors, such as extra-articular manifestation of the infection, AVN of the&#xD;
      femoral head, severe degeneration of the joint, multi-joint involvement, SUV-max values on&#xD;
      FDG-PET-CT and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most literature surrounding this subject is limited to case reports and case series with&#xD;
      small sample sizes. Due to the sizable amounts of tertiary references, a large population of&#xD;
      transplant patients treated at the institution UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg, and the own experience&#xD;
      of the investigators, the investigators are convinced that the population size at is&#xD;
      substantially larger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to gain more insight in clinical factors associated with failure of a single&#xD;
      surgical debridement in septic arthritis of the native hip, a retrospective cohort study will&#xD;
      be conducted. There are no detailed guidelines for the treatment of septic arthritis of the&#xD;
      native hip. Therefore, treatment today is similar to treatment 10 years ago (i.e. the&#xD;
      treating surgeon does what he thinks is best for the patient). This lack of a structured&#xD;
      approach is the reason for this retrospective study and we aim to come up with principles to&#xD;
      guide treatment of future patients.&#xD;

    <description>A retrospective data registry containing clinical data of patients with septic arthritis of the native hip will be constructed. This data registry will contain a sizable amount of clinico-pathological features collected from the electronic patient registry. Subsequently, a retrospective cohort study will be conducted in order to establish associations between certain clinical factors and the likelihood of failure of the initial surgical debridement.</description>

    <description>A proportion analysis will be conducted in order to find typical characteristics present in patients with septic arthritis of the native hip. These characteristics will be used to find and describe a subpopulation of patients who would benefit from a staged procedure with femoral head resection and a temporary antibiotic-loaded cement spacer followed by total hip arthroplasty straight away, instead of initial debridement of the native hip.</description>
