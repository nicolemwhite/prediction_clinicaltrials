      Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure is associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate and represents a&#xD;
      significant worldwide public health burden. In European countries, the total amount of the&#xD;
      expenses related to heart failure represents 1 to 2% of the total health budget with 75%&#xD;
      spent during hospitalizations, making heart failure the most expensive pathology in&#xD;
      cardiology. Acute heart failure (AHF) has a poor prognosis despite improvements in therapy.&#xD;
      Hospital mortality is 2 to 4% the risk of death or readmission in the six months following&#xD;
      hospitalization is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients hospitalized for heart failure represent a very heterogeneous population in terms of&#xD;
      etiologies, clinical presentations and/or co-morbidities. Consequently, this implies variable&#xD;
      outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality, probably due to their different prognostic&#xD;
      factors. The precise spectrum of etiologies and prognostic factors of AHF in non selected&#xD;
      populations has not been exhaustively studied and only a few predictive models concerning AHF&#xD;
      have been validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemic heart disease, valvulopathy, arrhythmias, infections, hypertension and lack of&#xD;
      therapeutic compliance are often quoted as being the factors triggering heart failure. Some&#xD;
      triggering factors (ischemic heart disease, pulmonary infections, acute renal failure) seem&#xD;
      to be strongly associated with a poor prognosis in terms of hospital/out-patient mortality&#xD;
      and re-hospitalization rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complex relation between heart failure and acute renal failure is defined by the&#xD;
      cardio-renal syndrome. Thirty percent of patients hospitalized for AHF will be diagnosed with&#xD;
      an acute renal failure at admission or with worsening kidney failure during hospitalization.&#xD;
      It seems that heart failure and cardio-renal syndrome are two distinct entities with a&#xD;
      different prognosis. The type of acute renal failure (functional, renal or post-renal) in&#xD;
      these patients and the prognostic value of these etiologies is still not firmly established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thorough determination of the etiologies and prognostic factors of AHF are necessary in&#xD;
      order to allow the identification of high-risk patients and the improvement of heart failure&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To create an observational registry of all patients hospitalized for a AHF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the precise prevalence of etiologies and the prognostic factors of AHF in a&#xD;
           non selected population. Among the prognostic factors, to establish the specific role of&#xD;
           acute renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the optimal initial assessment of patients hospitalized for heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate and compare with prospective data the results of a retrospective cohort&#xD;
           study carried out at the University Hospital of Geneva who established the&#xD;
           re-hospitalization and mortality outcome of patients hospitalized for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creation of an observational registry associated with a biobank including patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for AHF in the Department of General Internal medicine (SMIG) and in the&#xD;
      Departments of Specialties at the University Hospital of Geneva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the prevalence of the etiologies and the prognostic factors of the heart&#xD;
           failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the optimal initial assessment of the patients hospitalized for a heart&#xD;
           failure. Among the prognostic factors, to establish the specific role of acute renal&#xD;
           failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate and compare results of a retrospective cohort study carried out at the&#xD;
           University Hospital of Geneva which established the re-hospitalization and mortality&#xD;
           outcome of patients hospitalized AHF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve the management of hospitalized patients with AHF with a robust identification&#xD;
           of the etiologies and a better identification of high-risk patients.&#xD;
