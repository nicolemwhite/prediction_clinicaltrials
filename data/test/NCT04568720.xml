  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer in my country, but the 5-year survival time of&#xD;
      lung cancer patients is only 17%. Among them, the biggest reason that affects the patient's&#xD;
      prognosis is the metastasis of the tumor. There are very few clinical methods suitable for&#xD;
      the treatment of metastatic lung cancer, and the curative effect is not good. Therefore,&#xD;
      early monitoring and interventions to prevent distant colonization of metastases are the key&#xD;
      to improving the survival of lung cancer. The preliminary research of this project found that&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood can be used as an effective means for clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of lung malignant tumors. Through the analysis of the difference in&#xD;
      time and space metastasis of lung cancer patients, it is found that the genomes of different&#xD;
      metastasis stages and metastatic organs of lung cancer are quite different , And is closely&#xD;
      related to the patient's survival. For this reason, we propose the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      genomic mutation characteristics of circulating tumor cells can detect tumor metastasis&#xD;
      signals earlier than CT imaging diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, we will develop a cancer&#xD;
      metastasis risk assessment system based on tumor genomics. First, we collect big data on the&#xD;
      genome of primary and metastatic lung cancer from public databases, and use statistical&#xD;
      methods to screen out genomic features that are significantly related to metastatic lung&#xD;
      cancer and its metastatic colonization organs. Secondly, using these features to develop a&#xD;
      set of machine learning models that can determine the risk of metastasis of a lung cancer&#xD;
      based on its genome features. Finally, we applied the model to clinical practice. By&#xD;
      detecting the circulating tumor cells of patients with primary lung cancer during the&#xD;
      reexamination, we established a statistical noise reduction model to extract the genomic&#xD;
      characteristics, and then substituted into the model to determine the circulating tumor cells&#xD;
      carried by the patient Whether there is a risk of recurrence and metastasis. By comparing the&#xD;
      imaging data in the review, we will verify whether the model detects early metastasis signals&#xD;
      of lung cancer earlier than imaging methods. Ultimately, our model will aggregate genomic&#xD;
      markers related to metastasis risk, explore their drug targeting, and provide powerful big&#xD;
      data analysis support for early intervention in metastasis colonization and prolonging the&#xD;
      survival of lung cancer patients. If the topic is demonstrated, it will help to clarify the&#xD;
      use of tumor genome big data analysis to reveal the genomic driver mutations of metastatic&#xD;
      lung cancer; demonstrate the feasibility of circulating tumor cell genome driver mutations to&#xD;
      predict the risk of lung cancer metastasis; and finally clarify the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal Can&#xD;
      inhibitors of the pathway be used as a target for early intervention in lung cancer&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
