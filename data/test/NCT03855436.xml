  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary intermediate lesions generally refer to lumen narrowing with diameter stenosis%&#xD;
      (DS%) between 50% and 70% on angiography. Prognosis varies significantly among patients with&#xD;
      intermediate lesions, and some lesions progress rapidly leading to adverse cardiovascular&#xD;
      events. Therefore, accurate risk stratification is important and will help clinicians&#xD;
      identify patients at high risk of adverse events. The aim of study is to identify independent&#xD;
      risk factors for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients with intermediate&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, single-center, ongoing, observational study, which aims at&#xD;
      enrolling approximately 1389 patients with intermediate coronary lesions. After enrollment,&#xD;
      the following data are collected for each participant: baseline characteristics including&#xD;
      demographics, clinical presentation, traditional risk factor, diagnosis and management;&#xD;
      lesion characteristics assessed by coronary angiography; quantitative flow reserve; lab tests&#xD;
      including blood chemistry, blood lipid, hemoglobin A1C, cardiac biomarker, BNP, et al.&#xD;
      Patients are followed up at 2 year for primary outcome including death, myocardial infarction&#xD;
      and repeat unplanned revascularization. A risk prediction score will be established and&#xD;
      validated for major adverse cardiovascular disease at two-year follow-up.&#xD;

      Study setting This ongoing study is conducted in Fuwai Hospital, one of the world's biggest&#xD;
      cardiovascular center specializing in all kinds of cardiovascular diseases, particularly&#xD;
      those complex, difficult, and severe cardiovascular diseases. More than 10000 angiographic&#xD;
      procedures is performed each year in Fuwai Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2017 January 1st, all patients admitted to Fuwai Hospital receiving elective coronary&#xD;
      angiography were screened for eligibility. Detailed inclusion and exclusion creteria are&#xD;
      shown as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Receiving elective coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One or more lesions located in main coronary arteries with intermediate stenosis&#xD;
           (defined as diameter stenosis of 50%-70%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No lesions with significant stenosis (greater than 70%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unable to sign consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
           (CABG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Planned PCI or CABG&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Left ventricle ejection fraction % (LVEF%)&lt;35% or cardiogenic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Other severe comorbidities with life expectancy &lt;1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality assurance Data are collected, submitted and stored online to the Informatics&#xD;
      Center of Fuwai Hospital. Data are stored and protected managed according to national&#xD;
      information security protection law. The following measures are adopted for data quality&#xD;
      control. (1) Research staff will only be given access to a password-protected data-entry&#xD;
      system after formal training. (2) A real-time, automated algorithm is used to check the&#xD;
      logic, range, validity, consistency, completeness of data entered in the system. (3)&#xD;
      Approximately 10% of online records are selected randomly and checked against the source&#xD;
      documentation. (4) Data management team will check data quality regularly, and ask research&#xD;
      staff to review and revise the missing, invalid and illogical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data Several measures will be adopted to manage missing data: (1) &quot;Required&quot; fields&#xD;
      are used for key variables during data entry. (2) We conducted pilot testing to identify&#xD;
      variables with high rate of missing data, explore possible reasons and improve data&#xD;
      collection. (3) Data management team will monitor data quality periodically and send queries&#xD;
      to researchers to enter the missing data and check invalid data. (4) During statistical&#xD;
      analysis phase, based on the type, pattern and amount of missing data, appropriated methods&#xD;
      will be used to handle missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data are collected by trained experienced cardiologists and by using&#xD;
      standardized definition in accordance with ACC/AHA Task Force on clinical Data Standards and&#xD;
      NCDR-CathPCI registry Data Coder's Dictionary, including patient demographics, clinical&#xD;
      presentation, medical history, risk factors, physical examination, laboratory results,&#xD;
      clinical events, angiographic characteristics and procedural characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) QFR was calculated based on coronary angiography [9] and&#xD;
      detailed algorithms for calculation have been described. In the first step, two angiographic&#xD;
      images at the same cardiac phase, at least 25° apart, were selected and transferred to QFR&#xD;
      system. A common anatomic landmark on two image frames was defined for system offset&#xD;
      correction. The start and end point of the interrogated vessel was then defined, and lumen&#xD;
      counters of the interrogated vessel were automatically delineated. In case of suboptimal&#xD;
      image quality, manual correction was performed. In the next step, contrast-entry and&#xD;
      contrast-exit frames for interrogated vessel were defined, followed by generation of QFR&#xD;
      report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Biomarker Fasting blood samples were taken from cubital veins on the first day of&#xD;
      admission, before and after coronary angiography procedure for biomarker and analysis. Serum&#xD;
      and plasma are separated and stored in batches for analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells are separated by centrifugation techniques and stored at -80°C. Full blood count, blood&#xD;
      chemistry test including high sensitivity C-Reactive protein (hs-CRP), lipoprotein,&#xD;
      creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), blood lipid, Na+, K+, glucose,&#xD;
      N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitive Troponin I (hsTnI) ,&#xD;
      troponin I (TnI), microalbumin urine test are performed as routine practice in Fuwai&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up All participants in this project are followed-up at 2 year by telephone call or&#xD;
      e-mail. Vital status, adverse event, medication adherence, control of risk factors including&#xD;
      smoking, BMI, blood pressure, blood lipid, blood glucose and physical activity are collected&#xD;
      by trained staff using standardized form. If any adverse event is reported, medical records&#xD;
      are reviewed carefully and adjudicated by independent clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures The primary outcome was defined as major adverse cardiovascular&#xD;
      events (MACE), which was defined as a composite of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (MI) and unplanned repeat revascularization.&#xD;
