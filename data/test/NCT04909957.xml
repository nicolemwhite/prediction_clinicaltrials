  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite lymph node involvement (LNI) being one of the main prognostic factors in patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer (PCa), pelvic lymph node irradiation remains debated, possibly due to an&#xD;
      insufficient selection of patients. Significant advances in LNI risk modelling have been&#xD;
      achieved with the addition of visual interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data,&#xD;
      but it is likely that quantitative analysis could further improve prediction models. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators aimed to develop and internally validate a novel LNI risk prediction&#xD;
      model based on radiomic features extracted from pre-operative multimodal MRI.&#xD;
