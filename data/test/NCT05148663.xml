    <textblock>
      Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), one of the most common microvascular malformations&#xD;
      in the capillary beds of the brain, are susceptible to hemorrhagic stroke. As an autosomal&#xD;
      dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance, the majority of CCM gene mutation carriers are&#xD;
      largely asymptomatic but when symptoms occur, the disease has typically reached the stage of&#xD;
      focal hemorrhage with irreversible brain damage. Currently, the invasive neurosurgery removal&#xD;
      of CCM lesions is the only treatment option, despite the recurrence of the symptoms after&#xD;
      surgery. Therefore, there is a grave need for prognostic/monitoring biomarkers as risk&#xD;
      predictors for stroke prevention. The objective of the proposal is to develop a set of blood&#xD;
      prognostic/monitoring biomarkers as precise risk indicators for stroke prevention. In this&#xD;
      project, the plan is to validate the novel serum biomarkers identified in Ccms animal models&#xD;
      and human CCMs patients, and utilize these biomarkers with statistical algorithms for risk&#xD;
      prediction of hemorrhagic CCMs. This proposal has been formulated based on recent findings of&#xD;
      five serum etiological biomarkers associated with disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier&#xD;
      (BBB), the first step for hemorrhagic CCMs in Ccm mice models. This work will lay the&#xD;
      groundwork for larger human trials for final validation and revolutionary potential clinical&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), one of the most common vascular malformations, are&#xD;
      characterized by abnormally dilated intracranial capillaries resulting in increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to hemorrhagic stroke. As an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete&#xD;
      penetrance, the majority of CCMs gene mutation carriers are largely asymptomatic but when&#xD;
      symptoms occur, the disease has typically reached the stage of focal hemorrhage with&#xD;
      irreversible brain damage. Currently, the invasive neurosurgery removal of CCM lesions is the&#xD;
      only treatment option, despite the recurrence of symptoms after surgery. Therefore, there is&#xD;
      a grave need for prognostic/monitoring biomarkers as risk predictors for stroke prevention.&#xD;
      The goal is to develop a set of blood prognostic biomarkers as risk predictors for stroke&#xD;
      prevention. The objective of this project is to validate novel serum biomarkers identified in&#xD;
      Ccm animal models in human blood that could predict the risk of hemorrhagic events. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that quantitative detection of certain serum biomarkers can be utilized&#xD;
      to predict the timing of hemorrhagic events. The hypothesis has been formulated based on the&#xD;
      recent findings of five serum etiological biomarkers associated with disruption of the&#xD;
      Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), which could lead to hemorrhagic events. Taking advantage of the&#xD;
      research team's expertise in Ccm pathology and serum biomarkers, the central hypothesis will&#xD;
      be tested to achieve the study goal by pursuing the following three revolutionary aims in two&#xD;
      phases, starting from the phase 1 with the first two biomarker discovery aims (1, 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validate blood prognostic/monitoring biomarkers with the optimized detection platform&#xD;
           for hemorrhagic stroke prevention. The working hypothesis is that expression levels of&#xD;
           certain blood molecules are correlated with the progression of a disrupted BBB. In this&#xD;
           aim, serum biomarkers identified in Ccms mice will be validated in the blood samples of&#xD;
           CCM patients to evaluate their feasibility and reliability. The correlation functions&#xD;
           between the serum/plasma levels of biomarkers and the progression of a disrupted BBB&#xD;
           identified in Ccms mice will be tested using the &quot;gold standard&quot;, enzyme-linked&#xD;
           immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform in CCM patients for 1a). Clinical preparation for&#xD;
           large cohort CCM analysis; 1b). Validating serum progesterone (PRG) as a biomarker, and&#xD;
           1c). Validating 4 etiological serum peptide biomarkers with the optimized ELISA platform&#xD;
           in CCM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To optimize the sensitivity, specificity, dynamic range, and reliability of biomarkers&#xD;
           using the cutting-edge multiplex platform to predict risks of hemorrhagic stroke. The&#xD;
           working hypothesis is that the measurement parameters of blood biomarkers, such as&#xD;
           sensitivity, specificity, dynamic working range, and inter/intra variability, can be&#xD;
           drastically improved with a larger sample size, improved clinical definitions, and&#xD;
           better detection platforms. High-performance ELISAs will be continuously utilized for&#xD;
           validating etiological biomarkers. To ensure the highest sensitivity and specificity, a&#xD;
           robust automatic multiplex platform for the repetitive analysis of large cohorts is&#xD;
           essential to validate biomarkers for hemorrhagic strokes. Linear or logistic regression&#xD;
           analysis will be performed to delineate the correlation between validated biomarkers and&#xD;
           those of clinical criteria. In this aim, the will 2a). Improve sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity of candidate blood biomarkers through correlation equations were optimized&#xD;
           with increased CCM blood sample sizes and updated clinical information; 2b). Define new&#xD;
           biomarkers using high-throughput omic approaches, and 2c). Improve sensitivity and&#xD;
           increase dynamic working range of blood biomarkers with a multiplex bead array assay&#xD;
           (MBAA) platform and optimized protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase-2 Aim: 3) Improve clinical utility of validated prognostic/monitoring biomarkers with&#xD;
      optimized algorithms in larger cohorts in preparation for human clinical trials. The working&#xD;
      hypothesis is that clinical sensitivity and specificity of blood biomarkers can be further&#xD;
      improved through a blindly test-retest approach in larger independent human cohorts. This aim&#xD;
      will provide sufficient proof that the clinical utility of blood biomarkers can be improved&#xD;
      and utilized to predict the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, laying the groundwork for future&#xD;
      clinical trials and possible future revolutionary clinical applications. The research team&#xD;
      will continue to 3a). Improve clinical utility by optimizing the precision of&#xD;
      prognostic/monitoring algorithms of validated biomarker(s)/panel(s) using larger cohorts;&#xD;
      3b). Further improve clinical utility by confirming reliability of validated&#xD;
      biomarker(s)/panel(s) in a larger cohort; and 3c). Confirm validated prognostic/monitoring&#xD;
      biomarker(s)/panel(s) are ready for future clinical trials.&#xD;

    <description>Confirmation of at least (&gt;1) biomarker(s) is essential for the feasibility assessment of this project after three years investigation and validation in the mid-sized cohorts (~300 each cases/controls). Thus, to assess the consistency of the measurement between different CCM cohorts at the end of the 1st phase, the blinded test-retest reliability (r2) will be calculated with a relatively strong outcome range (~0.65-0.70, p=0.005) on at least (&gt;1) positively/negatively correlated biomarker(s).</description>
