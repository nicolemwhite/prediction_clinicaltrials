  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the most common causes of hospitalization and&#xD;
      life-threatening medical condition around worldwide. The AHF patients admitted to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) usually be critically ill with multiorgan failure, in which the&#xD;
      kidneys are most frequently involved. The goals of treatment of AHF in ICU were to improve&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability and organ perfusion, alleviate symptoms, and limit cardiac and renal&#xD;
      damage, which can be achieved by continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), a continuous&#xD;
      extracorporeal blood purification. CRRT can mimic urine output to slowly and continuously&#xD;
      remove patient's plasma water, providing accurate volume control and hemodynamic stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Heart Failure Global Survey of Standard Treatment (ALARM-HF) study showed that hospital&#xD;
      mortality of AHF patients was about 17.8% in the intensive care unit (ICU). But the patients&#xD;
      undergoing CRRT, the mortality up to 45%-62.1%. For this reason, an early model or score to a&#xD;
      screening of AHF patients undergoing CRRT who at high mortality risk is crucial, which can&#xD;
      help clinicians to rapidly intervene and ameliorate disease outcomes. The most popular tools,&#xD;
      especially that can predict mortality for critically ill patients, are the Acute Physiology&#xD;
      Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scoring systems, and Simplified Acute&#xD;
      Physiologic Score II (SAPS II). But variables in these scoring systems are complex, which was&#xD;
      not convenient to assess at any time. Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) , much more concise&#xD;
      than APACHE II and SAPS II, not only can be used for early warning of the onset of AHF in&#xD;
      patients with the risk of heart failure but also has a positive correlation with mortality in&#xD;
      these patients. However, up to our knowledge, there was no scores or model to predict the&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality of AHF patient undergoing CRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the acute heart failure unit (AHFU) of Qilu Hospital and the medical information&#xD;
      mart for intensive care III (MIMIC III) database, the investigators collected the data of AHF&#xD;
      adults undergoing CRRT. The present study aimed to develop and validate a simple-to-use&#xD;
      nomogram model comprised of independent prognostic variables for predicting in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality in AHF adults undergoing CRRT by using multivariate logistic regression analysis.&#xD;
      With this model, the investigators can guide the early screening of high-risk patients in&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality.&#xD;

      The eligible patients randomly into training cohort and validation cohort. The univariate&#xD;
      logistics regression analyses were performed to determine the independent risk&#xD;
      characteristics in the training cohort of the presence of in-hospital all-cause death. Odds&#xD;
      Ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of these variables were estimated to quantify&#xD;
      the strength of these associations. All variables that showed a univariate relationship with&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality or that were considered clinically relevant were candidates for&#xD;
      stepwise multivariate analysis in the training cohort. A nomogram model, producing by using&#xD;
      the rms package, was formulated based on the results of independent risk factors in&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression. Based on the nomogram model, the total scores and&#xD;
      prediction of in-hospital mortality risk of each patient were added by each eligible variable&#xD;
      and then were converted to predicted probabilities both in the training cohort and validation&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluated the model for the prediction value of in-hospital mortality, firstly, the&#xD;
      investigators calculated the calibration of the model was measured by calibration with 1000&#xD;
      bootstrap samples to decrease the overfit bias. Model fitting was assessed using the&#xD;
      Hosmer-Lemeshow test to evaluate the goodness of fit. Secondly, the Harrell concordance index&#xD;
      (C index) and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) to evaluate the predictive&#xD;
      performance and discrimination of the nomogram. The ROC curve analysis was used to calculate&#xD;
      the optimal cutoff values that were determined by maximizing the Youden index. Third, the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of the resulting model was evaluated by decision curve analysis (DCA),&#xD;
      which was a method for evaluating alternative diagnostic or prognostic tools that had&#xD;
      advantages over others[16]. The increase in the discriminative value of MEWS and the&#xD;
      resulting model for mortality was assessed by the net reclassification index (NRI).&#xD;
