  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to axillary lymph node (ALN), internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) chain is also&#xD;
      the first-echelon nodal drainage site for metastasis and it provides important prognostic&#xD;
      information in breast cancer patients. However, decision about local treatment of IMLN is&#xD;
      still being made based on ALN status. The 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#xD;
      Guidelines recommend internal mammary lymph node irradiation for patients with more than 4&#xD;
      positive ALNs (category 1), and strongly consider irradiation for patients with 1 to 3&#xD;
      positive ALNs (category 2A). Therefore, there will be patients in positive ALN subgroup who&#xD;
      just face complications of an unnecessary radiation to IMLN and there will be patients in&#xD;
      negative ALN subgroup who do not receive adjuvant radiation therapy they really need. Thus,&#xD;
      these inclusion criteria of National Comprehensive Cancer Network might lead to&#xD;
      over-treatment and under-treatment. Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB)&#xD;
      provides a less invasive method of assessing the IMLN than surgical dissection. However, low&#xD;
      visualization rate of IM-SLN has been a restriction of IM-SLNB. A modified radiotracer&#xD;
      injection technique was established in our previous study. This technique could significantly&#xD;
      improve the IM-SLN detection rate. The investigators have validated the accurate of the&#xD;
      hypothesis and the modified radiotracer injection technique in the previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy, the success rate and the accuracy are the most&#xD;
      important technical indicators. The relatively lower false-negative rate is a precondition&#xD;
      for the widely application of SLNB. Axillary SLNB needs to be accomplished with the&#xD;
      cooperation of multi-disciplinary teamwork, including the breast surgery, the radiologist,&#xD;
      the nuclear medicine doctor and the pathologist, in order to obtain a better success rate and&#xD;
      a lower false-negative rate. Our previous studies confirmed that the modified radiotracer&#xD;
      injection technique can greatly improve the IM-SLN detection rate. However, whether the&#xD;
      IM-SLNB based on the modified radiotracer injection technique has a low false negative rate&#xD;
      or not still need to be confirmed by a further validation research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermoreï¼Œrecently, the investigators propose that if IM-SLN is the only metastatic lymph&#xD;
      node and there would be no positive node else in IMLN chain, the radiotherapy and its&#xD;
      associated complications could be avoided in these patients. On the other hand, if there is&#xD;
      the presence of metastatic non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) in IMLN chain after IM-SLNB, it is&#xD;
      important to predict the risk of IM-NSLN metastasis in IM-SLN positive patients. As there is&#xD;
      currently no such model, a predictive model for IM-SLN positive patients to avoid&#xD;
      radiotherapy is needed in this situation. Therefore, a new study will be conducted to verify&#xD;
      the issues above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, all the participants (18~70 years of age) would have the preoperative&#xD;
      pathology of invasive breast cancer and positive fine-needle aspiration result in their&#xD;
      clinical or ultrasonic suspicious axillary lymph node. 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid was&#xD;
      injected into the parenchyma under the ultrasound guidance 3 to 18 hours before surgery. Two&#xD;
      syringes of 9.25 to 18.5MBq 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid in 0.5 to 0.7mL volume were injected&#xD;
      at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions 0.5 to 1.0 cm from areola (about 2.0~4.0 cm from the&#xD;
      nipple). IM-SLNB was performed in all participants with IMSLN visualized on preoperative&#xD;
      lymphoscintigraphy and/or detected by the intra-operative gamma probe. All hotspots in the&#xD;
      internal mammary basin were harvested and intra-operative identification of the IM-SLN was&#xD;
      based on gamma probe detection. The IM-SLN was sectioned along the long axis into two blocks&#xD;
      and all blocks were tested by the frozen section and the touch imprint cytology&#xD;
      intra-operatively. Those participants with positive intra-operative results received IMLN&#xD;
      dissection. Finally, all the IM-SLN blocks and IM-NSLN dissected were assessed&#xD;
      post-operatively by H&amp;E and Cytokeratin 19 stained immunohistochemistry. The conclusion would&#xD;
      be drawn through the results mentioned above.&#xD;
