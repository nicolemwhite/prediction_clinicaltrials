  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with schizophrenia have a higher risk of committing violent crimes than the general&#xD;
      population, and the relative risk of violence against others is four times higher than the&#xD;
      general population. Violence is a major public health problem because it often leads to poor&#xD;
      prognosis, readmission and stigma in patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI studies on violent behavior in schizophrenia are relatively few. These studies have found&#xD;
      that violence is primarily associated with dysfunction in the ventral prefrontal and temporal&#xD;
      limbic systems. Structural MRI found that violent behavior in schizophrenia was associated&#xD;
      with increased volume of white matter in caudate nucleus, left orbitofrontal gyrus and right&#xD;
      orbitofrontal gyrus. However, the current research results in this field are uneven, the&#xD;
      methods are not consistent, and there is a lack of breakthrough progress, which needs to be&#xD;
      integrated and deepened urgently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the violent behavior of the patients with schizophrenia could be predicted by magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging, it would be a revolutionary try. By doing so, the investigators can&#xD;
      strengthen the treatment of these patients and reduce the occurrence of violence. Based on&#xD;
      previous studies, the investigators believe that violent schizophrenics exhibit recognizable&#xD;
      imaging characteristics under structural phase, resting state, negative emotional images and&#xD;
      natural stimuli models. Anomalies in a particular mode may be subtle and difficult to&#xD;
      identify, but when multiple different modes are integrated, a significant and characteristic&#xD;
      set of imaging markers will be present. This study will use the multivariate model of machine&#xD;
      learning method, detection brain activation patterns under different situations among&#xD;
      patients with violence. The investigators are going to study imaging biomarkers, and try to&#xD;
      predict the possibility of onset of violence among schizophrenia patients, thus reduce the&#xD;
      risks of violence.&#xD;

        A total of 200 schizophrenic patients were collected in Shanghai Mental Health Center.&#xD;
        Through the assessment of violent behavior (MOAS scale + self-report), schizophrenic&#xD;
        patients were divided into violent group and non-violent group.&#xD;
