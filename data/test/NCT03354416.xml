      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers for men in the U.S. There are some new ways&#xD;
      to take pictures of the cancer. There are also new ways to use image-guided biopsy and&#xD;
      therapy. These could help manage prostate cancer. Researchers want to study how imaging can&#xD;
      provide a profile of prostate cancer. They want to collect data to make diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatments better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gather data about the radiological and clinical course of prostate cancer. To study&#xD;
      imaging-based biomarkers of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 18 and older with diagnosed or suspected prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give permission for researchers to use their medical history and records.&#xD;
      Their data will be reviewed, collected, and analyzed. These include results of their tests&#xD;
      and scans.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become an established method for localizing clinically&#xD;
           significant prostate cancer, and identification of imaging-based prognostic markers&#xD;
           represents an active research area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple treatments are available for patients with localized prostate cancer, including&#xD;
           radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and focal ablation;&#xD;
           however, therapy-specific indication and imaging-based response biomarkers are poorly&#xD;
           understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As mpMRI is considered a standard of care , there is no patient consent for research&#xD;
           related to imaging biomarkers and their correlation with other clinical and pathologic&#xD;
           features.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Translation of imaging, clinical, and pathological-based features into treatment&#xD;
           decisions has yet to be fully characterized for development of a decision-support&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore, the purpose of this protocol is to enable the collection of data to enable&#xD;
           research in the development of computer aided diagnosis, decision support and deep&#xD;
           learning/artificial intelligence research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate radiological profiling of patients with prostate cancer in support of the&#xD;
      Molecular Imaging Branch (MIB) for identification of imaging-based prognostic markers in&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with an increased risk for prostate cancer, with a diagnosis of prostatic&#xD;
           cancer or suspicious for prostatic cancer lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Imaging evaluation and clinical profiling of patients with an increased risk of prostate&#xD;
      cancer, with prostate cancer or suspected of prostate cancer obtained during visits to NCI&#xD;
      and long-term follow up will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;
