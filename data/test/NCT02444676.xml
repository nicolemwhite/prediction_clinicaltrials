      Background: Heart failure (HF) is in many cases the final way for coronary heart diseases. In&#xD;
      older than 65 years is the most important cause of hospitalization. Many studies have&#xD;
      analyzed the causes of decompensation and the possible causes of hospital re-admission but&#xD;
      most evidences come from the hospital setting. Nevertheless, It is known that many of these&#xD;
      patients are usually attended in primary care setting, being treated by their General&#xD;
      Practitioner and are not referred to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determinants which condition whether stable HF patients will be hospitalized as a&#xD;
      consequence of a decompensation remain still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To develop and validate a predictive model based on clinical variables easy to&#xD;
      measure at primary care to predict short-term hospitalization or mortality in a cohort of&#xD;
      patients attended in primary care setting as a consequence of a HF decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A cohort of patients with established HF attended in primary care setting (regular&#xD;
      care or out of hours) as a consequence of an episode of HF decompensation will be follow up.&#xD;
      To develop the predictive model we will select variables which previously have been found&#xD;
      involved in the risk of hospitalization or mortality as a consequence of HF as well as other&#xD;
      ones which could be relevant and have not been studied yet. Variables selected should be&#xD;
      easily determined in primary care setting..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predictive model obtained in the derivation cohort from Spain will be validated in an&#xD;
      external (several European countries) validation cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Our study will help GP to identify HF patients at higher risk of hospitalization&#xD;
      or death and manage them according to an accurate prognostic rule (escala pronostica) made in&#xD;
      primary care setting.[DISCUTIR]&#xD;

      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter prospective cohort study in which patients diagnosed of Heart Failure and&#xD;
      suffering from a clinical decompensation will be followed for a 30 days in order to predict&#xD;
      short-term hospitalització or mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Derivation cohort will consist of HF patients recruited in more than 20 general&#xD;
           practices settled in the city of Barcelona.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Internal validation cohort: population recruited will come from the same general&#xD;
           practices than derivation cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. External Validation population will come from the rest of European countries&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the health system could be different in the participant countries we will consider as a&#xD;
      primary care all consultations attended by General Practitioners out of the hospital setting&#xD;
      (which includes out of hours clinics managed by GP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous versions of this protocol have been presented to two European networks: Euroohnet&#xD;
      (European research network in out of hours) and EGPRN (European General Practice Research&#xD;
      Network).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be able to generalize the results to the European territory, all European&#xD;
      countries would be invited to participate. Up to data, Barcelona (Spain), France, Slovenia,&#xD;
      Ireland, Italia, Turkey and Portugal have accepted to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be consecutively recruited from September 2014 to September 2016, amongst&#xD;
      those previously diagnosed from HF who need to be attended in primary care from a clinical&#xD;
      decompensation Study protocol will be previously presented to all potential GP participants&#xD;
      and a hard copy will be distributed to all of them as well as informed consents to be signed&#xD;
      by the patients who accept to be included. In this protocol all the instructions regarding&#xD;
      recruitment, inclusion criteria, measurements and follow up will be written. GP participants&#xD;
      must agree with the study protocol, and to consent to participate and to provide necessary&#xD;
      data from their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is an observational study no randomization will be needed. Recruitment will end when&#xD;
      the sample size is raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Failure patients included in the study will come from primary care setting. We consider&#xD;
      primary care, the health assistance provided in outpatients by a General practitioner, or out&#xD;
      of hours care in primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 45 or more with previous diagnoses of HF in its medical record and a&#xD;
      decompensation of HF treated/attended in primary care settings at the moment of the&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decompensation is defined as the presence of at least one of the following clinical&#xD;
      conditions (12):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The worsening functional class according to the criteria of the New York Heart&#xD;
           Association (NYHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A weight gain of more than one kilogram in a period of 24 hours or greater than two&#xD;
           kilograms in a maximum of 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased ankle edema (self-reported by the patient, caregiver or physician)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with severe psychiatric illness or severe cognitive impairment, not able&#xD;
           complete the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refusal to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients directly attended in the hospital in the previous 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will be followed up to 30 days after the decompensation episode. We are&#xD;
      intended to consecutively including patients in the study during a period of two years, from&#xD;
      December 2014 to December 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION: Procedures, measurements and Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sources of information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables will be obtained by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview to the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical exploration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary medical record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital discharge reports. We will create a specifically designed questionnaire for the&#xD;
           study where will registry information about personal medical history, clinical&#xD;
           examination at the moment of the visits. These data will be supplemented with&#xD;
           information from primary care electronical medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient has signed the informed consent we will proceed to obtain the variables and&#xD;
      measurements for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the final database only an identification number should be available for each patient.&#xD;
      This ID should be easily associated with the data of patient, but only by their GP.&#xD;
      Identification of patients should not be allowed to the rest of researchers. Every GP&#xD;
      participant will have a list with their patients included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ID will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Country: SP (Spain), FR (France), PO(Portugal), TU (Turkey)…….. Surname of the GP responsible&#xD;
      for the patient (initial) Date of birth of the patient (day/month/year) (--/--/----) ID&#xD;
      number labeled by the main researcher of each country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinator centre (.Institut Català de la Salut. IDIAP-Jordi Gol, Spain) will design an&#xD;
      electronic on-line questionnaire (https://es.surveymonkey.com/) which will be hosted in the&#xD;
      website of IDIAP-Jordi Gol: (http://www.idiapjgol.org/) and e-mailed to all of GP&#xD;
