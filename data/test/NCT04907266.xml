      Clinical course of chronic pancreatitis is still unpredictable, due to the lack of clinical&#xD;
      classification. There is no model to assess disease severity or progression or predict&#xD;
      patient outcomes. So we need to validate an objective predictive model - Chronic Pancreatitis&#xD;
      Prognosis Score (COPPS) for classification, prognostication and management in Chronic&#xD;
      Pancreatitis (CP)&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by&#xD;
      abdominal pain, repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, and fibrotic destruction of the&#xD;
      organ, resulting in exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. During the last decade, several&#xD;
      reports have provided evidence that repeated attacks of acute pancreatitis may progress to&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease may present clinically either with an individual symptom or a combination of&#xD;
      symptoms associated with loss of pancreatic function. The natural history of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis is usually characterized by progression of tissue damage and various degrees of&#xD;
      exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which will become apparent over time,&#xD;
      independent of the underlying etiology, chronic pancreatitis evolves toward the same end&#xD;
      stage, i.e., pancreatic fibrosis [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of CP has been approximated at ~50/100,000 population [3]. The underlying&#xD;
      etiologies are multifactorial and among many involve excessive alcohol consumption, smoking,&#xD;
      genetic predisposition and autoimmune pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is general knowledge that the terminal stage of chronic pancreatitis results in a loss of&#xD;
      organ function, with the clinical manifestations of maldigestion and diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      However, there is little knowledge of the early structural and functional abnormalities&#xD;
      because the current diagnostic imaging procedures are not sensitive enough to visualize them&#xD;
      and histology is normally not available in these early stages [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal pain is the most frequent symptom of CP. However, the severity, temporal nature,&#xD;
      and natural history of pain is highly variable [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pancreatitis encompasses a number of disease entities and can be broadly classified&#xD;
      into three forms: chronic calcifying pancreatitis, chronic obstructive pancreatitis, and&#xD;
      steroid-responsive pancreatitis (chronic auto immune pancreatitis) [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presentation of multiple clinical symptoms and the frequent occurance of various&#xD;
      complications require a well-differentiated therapeutic approach. Current therapies in the&#xD;
      management of chronic pancreatitis include conservative measures (analgesics,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents, enzyme replacement), endoscopic interventions as well as surgical&#xD;
      procedures [7-10] The main reason for the lack of guided strategies in the therapeutic&#xD;
      management of chronic pancreatitis is the absence of clearity in the clinically applicable&#xD;
      classifications of chronic pancreatitis developed so far, which needs to be developed for&#xD;
      guiding management and predicting disease outcome [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      REVIEW OF LITERATURE For many years, pancreatologists have struggled to achieve a workable&#xD;
      classification of chronic pancreatitis. A uniformly accepted and clinically relevant&#xD;
      classification is essential to allow for a valid comparison of information among&#xD;
      institutions, to improve patient care, and to ensure that patients entered into randomized&#xD;
      trials have similar characteristics. Such a classification is also required for staging the&#xD;
      disease severity, to plan the management accordingly and to predict disease outcome in both&#xD;
      short and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first classification of chronic pancreatitis was developed at a symposium in Marseilles&#xD;
      in 1963, it was based on morphological changes and etiology underlying the disease [12].It&#xD;
      correlated clinical features with histology. Pancreatitis was classified as the following&#xD;
      four subgroups: acute pancreatitis, relapsing acute pancreatitis, chronic relapsing&#xD;
      pancreatitis, and chronic (primarily painless) pancreatitis. The term acute pancreatitis&#xD;
      referred to an episode of acute inflammation of the pancreas that resolved completely both&#xD;
      clinically and histologically. Relapsing acute pancreatitis referred to recurring episodes of&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis that also resolved completely both clinically and histology. The term&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis indicated that histologic changes persisted even after the etiologic&#xD;
      agent had been removed. The distinction between chronic relapsing and chronic (primarily&#xD;
      painless) pancreatitis was clinical. It was thought that almost all diseases that caused&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis were associated with recurring episodes of pain, and they were therefore&#xD;
      termed chronic relapsing pancreatitis, including both chronic pancreatitis caused by alcohol&#xD;
      and hereditary pancreatitis. It was recognized that some patients with chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
      never experienced pain and that others might experience fewer episodes of pain in time. In&#xD;
      summary, at the Marseille Classification Symposium, acute pancreatitis was thought to be&#xD;
      associated with complete structural and functional recovery, and it was thought to rarely&#xD;
      evolve into chronic pancreatitis. On the other hand, in chronic pancreatitis, structural and&#xD;
      functional damage was thought to persist even if the primary cause was eliminated. The major&#xD;
      focus of the Marseille Classification of 1963 was pathological anatomy and etiology, and no&#xD;
      correlation between anatomical and functional changes was discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was then generally recognized that reclassification of pancreatitis was required because&#xD;
      of the development of new imaging procedures and function tests. At an international workshop&#xD;
      in Cambridge in 1983 [13], a revised classification simplified matters by considering&#xD;
      pancreatitis as either acute or chronic. Acute pancreatitis was defined as an acute&#xD;
      inflammation of the pancreas, usually presenting with abdominal pain and usually associated&#xD;
      with increased pancreatic enzymes in the blood or urine. Acute pancreatitis was subdivided&#xD;
      into mild and severe cases, and it was recognized that acute pancreatitis could recur.&#xD;
      Chronic pancreatitis was defined as an ongoing inflammatory disease typically associated with&#xD;
      abdominal pain and characterized by irreversible structural changes and permanent loss of&#xD;
      function. It was acknowledged that chronic pancreatitis could recur and was occasionally&#xD;
      painless. The Cambridge classification, which was the first clinical grading system for&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis, was based on changes in ductal morphology on endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      pancreatography (ERP) [Table 1] and to some extent had equivalent findings on ultrasound or&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it was acknowledged that additional studies would be required to provide a grading&#xD;
      system of functional impairment. Subsequently, such a grading system of exocrine pancreatic&#xD;
      insufficiency has been developed (Table 3) and published [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cambridge criteria remain the standard for grading of chronic pancreatitis on imaging,&#xD;
      but already when it was first introduced, experts stated that morphological changes in&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis might not reflect the functional or histological state of the pancreas&#xD;
      and early stages of the disease might be missed [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the revised version of Marseille Classification, published in 1985 [16], the morphological&#xD;
      changes that were specified earlier, were linked to a potential loss of endocrine and&#xD;
      exocrine organ function. In acute pancreatitis there is a gradation of severity of histologic&#xD;
      lesions from mild peripancreatic fat necrosis and interstitial edema to a severe form&#xD;
      involving extensive peripancreatic and intrapancreatic fat necrosis, parenchymal necrosis,&#xD;
      and bleeding. The process can be localized or diffuse . It was also noted that clinical&#xD;
      severity need not correlate with morphological severity. Morphologic characterization of&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis was that of destruction and of permanent loss of exocrine parenchyma in&#xD;
      either a focal, segmental, or diffuse pattern, progressive or permanent loss of exocrine or&#xD;
      endocrine function, irregular scarring, varying degrees of pancreatic duct dilatation, and&#xD;
      preservation of islets of Langerhans. A distinctive form of chronic pancreatitis, obstructive&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis, was also delineated in this re-classification. Descriptive terms that&#xD;
      were applied included chronic pancreatitis with focal necrosis, chronic pancreatitis with&#xD;
      segmental or diffuse fibrosis, and chronic pancreatitis with or without calculi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further modifications in the Marseilles Classification were finally introduced in the&#xD;
      consecutively published Marseilles-Rome classification [6]. Two additional forms were&#xD;
      introduced- Chronic calcifying pancreatitis and Chronic inflammatory pancreatitis. Chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory pancreatitis was characterized by loss of exocrine parenchyma with replacement&#xD;
      by diffuse fibrosis with infiltration by mononuclear cells. Chronic calcifying pancreatitis&#xD;
      was subdivided into a variety of forms, including hereditary pancreatitis, nutritional&#xD;
      pancreatitis (including tropical pancreatitis), and hypercalcemic pancreatitis. They also&#xD;
      emphasized on the need for the development of a clinical classification of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ammann introduced the concept of stage wise progression in chronic alcoholic pancreatitis.&#xD;
      Two stages in the evolution of CP were distinguished: (1) early-stage CP, i.e., no&#xD;
      calcification and only minor or no exocrine insufficiency; and (2) late-stage CP, i.e., with&#xD;
      calcification and/or persistent exocrine insufficiency. [17] In 2002, Ramesh et al [18]&#xD;
      proposed ABC classification which graded chronic pancreatitis based on the presence or&#xD;
      absence of clinical pain syndrome and complications like bile duct/ duodenal&#xD;
      obstruction/bleeding complications, but it does not clearly differentiate between different&#xD;
      degrees of disease severity within a given category, nor does it allow categorization of all&#xD;
      possible clinical presentations of chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2006, Manchester classification [19] graded chronic pancreatitis into mild, moderate and&#xD;
      severe categories. In mild chronic pancreatitis, there was no regular opiate intake (with&#xD;
      regular being defined as weekly) and that there be no clinical evidence of impaired&#xD;
      pancreatic exocrine or endocrine function or extra-pancreatic complications (duodenal&#xD;
      stenosis, portal vein thrombosis and/or distal bile duct stricture). Moderate category has&#xD;
      regular abdominal pain requiring opiod use with clinical evidence of impairment of either&#xD;
      endocrine or exocrine function without extra-pancreatic complications. End stage chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis has a range of extra-pancreatic complications plus one or more clinical factors&#xD;
      to suggest end-stage pancreatic function: either steatorrhoea or diabetes mellitus. [Table 4]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 4. MANCHESTER CLASSIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2007, based on the previous chronic pancreatitis classifications, Schneider J et al&#xD;
      proposed the MANNHEIM classification [20], grading the disease on the basis of clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, imaging findings based on Cambridge classification and pancreatic function&#xD;
      insufficiency. It had the following diagnostic criteria-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definite chronic pancreatitis is established by one or more of the following additional&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pancreatic calcifications&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate or marked ductal lesions (according to the Cambridge classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Marked and persistent exocrine insufficiency defined as pancreatic steatorrhea markedly&#xD;
           reduced by enzyme supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Typical histology of an adequate histological specimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable chronic pancreatitis is established by one or more of the following additional&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild ductal alterations (according to the Cambridge classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recurrent or persistent pseudocysts&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pathological test of pancreatic exocrine function (such as fecal elastase-1 test,&#xD;
           secretin test, secretin-pancreozymin test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Endocrine insufficiency (i.e., abnormal glucose tolerance test) Borderline chronic&#xD;
           pancreatitis is already established and is defined by a typical clinical history of the&#xD;
           disease but without any of the additional criteria required for definite or probable&#xD;
           chronic pancreatitis. This form is also established as a first episode of acute&#xD;
           pancreatitis with or without (1) a family history of pancreatic disease (i.e., other&#xD;
           family members with acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer) or (2) the presence of risk&#xD;
           factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           They also proposed a clinical staging system, subcategorizing into an asymptomatic phase&#xD;
           (stage 0) and a symptomatic phase (stages I, II, III, IV) of chronic pancreatitis [table&#xD;
           5]. The poorly defined asymptomatic and early phase of chronic pancreatitis, during&#xD;
           which clinically recognized symptoms are not present (stage 0 a), was estimated only&#xD;
           retrospectively, for example, during surgical intervention or by autopsy. First episode&#xD;
           of acute pancreatitis (stage 0 b) was also included since it has been hypothesized that&#xD;
           any episode of acute pancreatitis in individuals at risk may cause the later development&#xD;
           of chronic pancreatitis. Table 5 . M-ANNHEIM clinical staging of chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
           This classification also includes a scoring system to determine the severity of the&#xD;
           disease to guide clinical treatment decisions and to predict the prognosis of the&#xD;
           disease [table 6]. But it is rather a very complex score was not correlated against any&#xD;
           valid outcome criteria when first developed [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Table 6. M-ANNHEIM scoring system for the grading of clinical features of chronic&#xD;
           pancreatitis In 2009, came the Heidelberg classification [11]which again classified the&#xD;
           disease based on clinical features, imaging findings, presence or absence of local&#xD;
           complications and end stage disease in the form of exocrine or endocrine insufficiency.&#xD;
           Stage A disease was defined as pain of any type and degree and/or attacks of acute&#xD;
           pancreatitis, without any complications ; nor steatorrhea, nor insulin-dependent&#xD;
           diabetes mellitus. Stage B is the intermediate stage where chronic pancreatitis has led&#xD;
           to complications like bile duct obstruction with cholestasis or jaundice ,duodenal&#xD;
           obstruction, vascular obstruction , portal/splenic vein hypertension, pancreatic&#xD;
           pseudocysts , pancreatic fistula (internal or external), pancreatogenic ascites but&#xD;
           clinical exocrine and endocrine function is still preserved. Stage C is the end stage of&#xD;
           chronic pancreatitis, where pancreatic fibrosis has led to clinical exocrine and/or&#xD;
           endocrine pancreatic function loss (steatorrhea and/or diabetes mellitus). Complications&#xD;
           of chronic pancreatitis might or might not be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All these classifications described earlier help to describe the natural progression of&#xD;
           the disease by grading the severity on the basis of imaging, clinical symptoms, need for&#xD;
           intervention and loss of function, but are neither suited to assess the current severity&#xD;
           nor to evaluate short- to mid-term outcomes of the disease [21]. Furthermore, none of&#xD;
           the published severity scoring systems have been developed in a prospective cohort of&#xD;
           patients nor have they been evaluated for predicting relevant clinical outcome&#xD;
           parameters, so in future we need to develop an objective scoring system for&#xD;
           classification of chronic pancreatitis which is simple to use on day to day basis yet&#xD;
           effective in predicting disease outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In 2016, Olsen et al did a prospective study in Denmark [22] on their cohort of chronic&#xD;
           pancreatitis outpatients and studied various risk factors for the hospitalization rate.&#xD;
           On multivariate analysis they demonstrated that high dose opioid treatment (&gt;100 mg per&#xD;
           day) and hypoalbuminemia were identified as independent risk factors for&#xD;
           hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recently in 2017 Bayer et al [21]have developed a simple and dynamic scoring&#xD;
           system-Chronic Pancreatitis Prognostic score (COPPS), in a prospective study, comparable&#xD;
           to the Turcotte-Child-Pugh-score for liver cirrhosis based on routine laboratory&#xD;
           parameters (serum platelet counts, CRP, HbA1c), pain symptoms, body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
           They have also validated the same in an independent cohort and found positive&#xD;
           co-relation with hospital re-admission rates and duration of hospital stay in the follow&#xD;
           up. On this basis they propose that it can be used by general physicians in the&#xD;
           outpatient setting and hospitalists alike to reliably predict the risk of hospital&#xD;
           (re)admission as a measure of disease severity. This is a new score which need to be&#xD;
           further validated in other patient cohort of chronic pancreatitis to prove its utility&#xD;
           in predicting disease outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           AIM OF THE STUDY&#xD;

                outcomes&#xD;
