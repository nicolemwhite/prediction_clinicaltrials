      The project aims to develop prognostic and diagnostic blood tests for symptomatic brain&#xD;
      hemorrhage in patients diagnosed with cavernous angiomas, a critical clinical challenge in a&#xD;
      disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers&#xD;
      can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional&#xD;
      bleeding. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a&#xD;
      mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease, with a clinically relevant context of use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million&#xD;
      Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000&#xD;
      cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed&#xD;
      again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development.&#xD;
      Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations&#xD;
      in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood-brain barrier&#xD;
      hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain,&#xD;
      and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms&#xD;
      and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize&#xD;
      these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to&#xD;
      monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical&#xD;
      management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers&#xD;
      are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be&#xD;
      expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of&#xD;
      CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic&#xD;
      acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect&#xD;
      (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA&#xD;
      hemorrhage. We here assemble CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and&#xD;
      computational biology approaches for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers. In&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort to discover the best plasma&#xD;
      biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2&#xD;
      we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma&#xD;
      biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to&#xD;
      identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project integrates analytic and&#xD;
      computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a&#xD;
      mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach&#xD;
      is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features.&#xD;

        We propose to recruit human subjects at three sites, with the project approved and&#xD;
        coordinated by the University of Chicago Medicine (UCM) central institutional review board&#xD;
        (IRB) and endorsed by respective IRBs at the other two enrolling sites. The study involves&#xD;
        no more than minimal risks, discussed herein. The enrolling sites include UCM where the&#xD;
        project will be led and where the data coordinating center (DCC) is located and all plasma&#xD;
        biomarker assays and statistical analyses are planned, the University of California at San&#xD;
        Francisco (UCSF), and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (Mayo). UCSF and Mayo are participants in&#xD;
        imaging biomarker validations in longitudinal follow-up of cavernous angioma with&#xD;
        symptomatic hemorrhage (CASH) subjects in the TR Project. We project enrolling 1,040 cases&#xD;
        during 4 years to address hypotheses in 3 Specific Aims (40 cases enrolled in Specific Aim&#xD;
        2 are also included among the 800 subjects addressing hypotheses of Specific Aim 1).&#xD;
