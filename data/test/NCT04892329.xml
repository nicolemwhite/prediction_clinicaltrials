    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers. Survival rates vary largely depending on&#xD;
      the stage at which it is diagnosed. EUS is considered one of the most sensitive modalities&#xD;
      for pancreatic cancer detection. To avoid a missed diagnosis of the pancreatic cancer, the&#xD;
      continuity and integrity of EUS needs to be ensured as much as possible. The station approach&#xD;
      in pancreatic EUS has been established as the standard scanning procedure. Complete&#xD;
      anatomical scanning is helpful for the identification of standard stations, and its imaging&#xD;
      findings can assist in the diagnosis of pancreatic lesions and guide patient treatment and&#xD;
      prognosis. But EUS is highly operator-dependent and the learning curve is steep. In this&#xD;
      study, we constructed a deep learning-based pancreatic scanning navigation system in EUS,&#xD;
      which can assist in identifying important anatomical structures adjacent to the pancreas in&#xD;
      real time. In order to improve the quality of EUS and reduce the missed diagnosis of&#xD;
      pancreatic lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a malignant tumor of the digestive system with insidious onset, rapid&#xD;
      progression and very poor prognosis. According to the latest cancer data in China in 2020&#xD;
      released by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health&#xD;
      Organization, there are about 120,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer in China, with a&#xD;
      mortality rate close to 100%, which seriously endangers the national health. Early diagnosis&#xD;
      of pancreatic cancer can be achieved by surgical resection with a 5-year survival rate of&#xD;
      58%, Once advanced pancreatic cancer develops, patient survival is 7.2%. As a rapidly&#xD;
      developing deadly cancer, missed diagnosis of pancreatic cancer may have extremely serious&#xD;
      consequences for patients.How to improve the diagnostic rate of early pancreatic cancer is an&#xD;
      urgent problem to be solved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS(endoscopic ultrasonography) is considered one of the most sensitive modalities for&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer detection. It has a much higher diagnostic accuracy than MRI and CT for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, especially early pancreatic cancer &lt; 1 cm in diameter&#xD;
      (EUS-FNA 95.6% vs CT 77.4%, MRI 76.2%). EUS is the modality of choice for the early diagnosis&#xD;
      of pancreatic tumors. To avoid a missed diagnosis of the pancreatic cancer, the continuity&#xD;
      and integrity of EUS needs to be ensured as much as possible. But EUS is highly&#xD;
      operator-dependent and the learning curve is steep, and the quality of the examination is&#xD;
      highly dependent on the operator's technique. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a system&#xD;
      that can effectively assist the full scanning of EUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The station approach in pancreatic EUS has been established as the standard scanning&#xD;
      procedure. The principle of completing the station approach is to find the anatomical&#xD;
      landmarks of this station, Such as organs (kidney, spleen), blood vessels (such as splenic&#xD;
      artery, splenic vein, portal vein), ducts (pancreatic duct, bile duct), etc.The scanning of&#xD;
      these anatomical landmarks is the basis for an accurate assessment of the entire pancreasã€‚ At&#xD;
      the same time, the type of pancreatic lesions and the development of the course have abnormal&#xD;
      imaging findings of different anatomical structure. For example, ultrasound images of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer will show vascular invasion, deformation of the biliopancreatic duct, and&#xD;
      metastasis of adjacent organs. The guidelines clearly require that the choice of surgical&#xD;
      approach for pancreatic cancer needs to be based on the degree of invasion of the cancer to&#xD;
      adjacent important anatomical structures, to maximize the volume sparing of functional&#xD;
      pancreatic parenchyma. Complete anatomical scanning can assist in the diagnosis of pancreatic&#xD;
      lesions and guide patient treatment and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied in multiple&#xD;
      medical fields. At present, there have been studies of AI-based endoscopic ultrasonography&#xD;
      for the identification of pancreatic lesions, However, there are no studies of AI-based&#xD;
      navigation system for pancreatic endoscopic ultrasonography. Previously, we have successfully&#xD;
      developed a standard station scanning navigation system for the pancreas and bile ducts. This&#xD;
      system can improve the recognition accuracy of endoscopists for standard stations and enhance&#xD;
      the cognitive ability of endoscopic ultrasonography images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the previous, we constructed a deep learning-based pancreatic scanning navigation&#xD;
      system in EUS, which can assist in identifying important anatomical structures adjacent to&#xD;
      the pancreas in real time. and verify its auxiliary performance for endoscopists in clinical&#xD;
      practice. In order to improve the quality of EUS and reduce the missed diagnosis of&#xD;
      pancreatic lesions.&#xD;
