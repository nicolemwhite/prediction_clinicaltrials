      This study was a prospective, multicenter observational clinical study, A total of 150&#xD;
      patients with bladder malignant tumor who was admitted to the urology department of each&#xD;
      center for treatment and underwent electric resection or radical cystectomy were planned to&#xD;
      be enrolled. In order to analyze the sensitivity、specificity and accuracy of artificial&#xD;
      intelligence in predicting postoperative pathological staging, Patients who entered the group&#xD;
      were followed up for 3 years, then, we analyzed the correlation between artificial&#xD;
      intelligence prediction results and patient OS PFS RFS. It was preliminarily verified that&#xD;
      the results of the artificial intelligence model have the potential to predict the prognosis&#xD;
      of patients with bladder cancer.&#xD;

      Preliminary research: This research is multi-disciplinary joint research by combining&#xD;
      artificial intelligence with magnetic resonance, it can make the preoperative determination&#xD;
      of bladder cancer stage more accurate and guides the clinician worker's treatment plan. At&#xD;
      present, It has been constructed that an artificial intelligence model based on preoperative&#xD;
      magnetic resonance images to predict staging and patient prognosis. We built a staging&#xD;
      prediction model through deep learning artificial intelligence network, and collected&#xD;
      magnetic resonance image data and related postoperative pathological data of patients,&#xD;
      afterwards, We followed 576 patients on the basis of staging model construction. By obtaining&#xD;
      OS, PFS, and RFS of patients, a part was randomly selected as a training set for training the&#xD;
      deep learning network model. The other part is used as a test set to verify its accuracy.&#xD;
