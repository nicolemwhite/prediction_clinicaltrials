  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being easy, bedside, non-expensive, noninvasive and radiation free, there has been a growing&#xD;
      interest in the implementation of lung ultrasound in critical care management in the last&#xD;
      decade, cardiac surgery was not an exception in both adult and pediatric surgeries Many&#xD;
      predictors for open heart surgery outcomes have been studied in past years including The&#xD;
      Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score and the EuroSCORE (ES), preoperative clinical&#xD;
      condition, associated chronic diseases, type of surgery, age, duration of cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), cystatin-C A recent study described the use of a&#xD;
      novel postoperative lung ultrasound score scanning for B lines which denote subpleural&#xD;
      interstitial edema in various lung regions for predicting critical care length of stay in&#xD;
      pediatric cardiac surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the current study is to evaluate the role of the new lung ultrasound score&#xD;
      in predicting the length of postoperative intensive care stay after adult open heart&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After approval of the local institutional ethics committee and local institutional review&#xD;
      board. All patients scheduled for open heart surgery in Fayoum university hospital starting&#xD;
      from August 2020 will be enrolled in this prospective observational study until fulfilling&#xD;
      sample size. A detailed informed consent will be signed by the eligible participants before&#xD;
      recruitment ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE All patients will be preoperatively assessed and&#xD;
      investigated by complete blood count, coagulation profile, Liver and kidney functions and&#xD;
      serum electrolytes. Chest X-ray, Electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography will be&#xD;
      routinely done. Coronary angiography and carotid arterial duplex will be requested if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be premedicated by 10 mg morphine intramuscularly at morning of the operation.&#xD;
      Prior to induction of anesthesia, standard monitoring will be applied including a five-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiography system, a pulse oximeter probe. A peripheral intravenous (IV) cannula&#xD;
      will be placed. An arterial will be inserted using a 20 G cannula either right or left radial&#xD;
      artery under local anesthesia. After pre-oxygenation, general anesthesia will be induced&#xD;
      using midazolam 2-5 mg, fentanyl (3-10 μg/kg), propofol (1-1.5 mg/Kg), followed by atracurium&#xD;
      (0.5 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After trachea intubation, patients will be mechanically ventilated with oxygen in air so as&#xD;
      to achieve normocarbia. A main stream capnogram, an esophageal temperature probe and a Foley&#xD;
      catheter will also be placed. A triple-lumen central venous catheter will be placed usually&#xD;
      through the right internal jugular vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of anesthesia will be achieved by inhaled Isoflurane 0.4 to 1% and atracurium&#xD;
      infusion at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/h. After initiating extracorporeal circulation, Propofol&#xD;
      infusion at a rate of 50-100 µg/kg/min will be added to replace isoflurane inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive intravenous heparin (300-500 IU/kg body weight) before the initiation&#xD;
      of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of more than 480&#xD;
      seconds. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted with the use of a non-pulsatile blood flow at&#xD;
      2.4 L/min/m2, a non-heparin-coated circuit, and a membrane oxygenator. Mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      will be adjusted to exceed 60mmHg before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) .&#xD;
      Cardiac arrest will be induced using St Thomas crystalloid solution (Hamburg). Lactated&#xD;
      Ringer's solution will be added to the CPB circuit to maintain reservoir volume if needed,&#xD;
      and packed red blood cells will be infused when hemoglobin level drops to less than 7g/dl.&#xD;
      After rewarming the patient to 37°C and weaning from CPB; Protamine sulfate will be used to&#xD;
      reverse the effect of heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After skin closure and wound dressing, patients will be transferred to the intensive care&#xD;
      unit intubated with manual ventilation and full monitoring during transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive care Tracheal extubation will be performed when the patient meets the following&#xD;
      criteria: awake or arousable, hemodynamically stable, no ongoing active bleeding, warm&#xD;
      extremities, no electrolyte abnormalities, no or minimal inotropic support and a satisfactory&#xD;
      arterial blood gas with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &lt; 0.5, Ventilator pressure&#xD;
      support reduced to 10 CmH2O with Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) 5-7 CmH2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU management and decisions will be left to the intensivist who is responsible of the&#xD;
      postoperative cardiac critical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be discharged from ICU when the following criteria are met: Awake patient with&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt; 90% at FIO2 &gt; 0.5 by facemask, adequate cardiac stability, no&#xD;
      intravenous inotropic or vasopressor supportive therapy, no hemodynamically significant&#xD;
      arrhythmia, not dependent on epicardial external pacing no major bleeding i.e. chest tube&#xD;
      drainage less than 50 ml/h, urine output of more than 0.5 ml/kg/h and no vital threats to&#xD;
      other organ systems such as kidneys and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung Ultrasound scan (LUS) All patients will be examined at 12 hours postoperatively as per&#xD;
      our institution routine using a convex ultrasound probe, any other LUS will be done upon&#xD;
      demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LUS will be performed by an experienced radiologist according to standardized protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be used to calculate total LUS-score (calculated as a sum of all quadrants score)&#xD;
      and individual areas score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using (G power). Minimal sample size of patients was 191 needed to&#xD;
      get power level 0.80, alpha level 0.05 (two tailed) and 0.20 as expected β (slope of&#xD;
      regression line) for predicting intensive care Length of stay .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version&#xD;
      22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation for&#xD;
      quantitative data, and number and percentages for qualitative data) will be used to summarize&#xD;
      the data. Nominal data will be analyzed using simple chi squared test, while independent&#xD;
      sample t-test or one-way ANOVA procedure will be used to compare means for two or three&#xD;
      groups of cases, respectively. Regression analysis will be performed to determine the&#xD;
      predictors for LOS. A probability value (P value) ≤ 0.05 is considered significant.&#xD;

    <description>12 hours postoperatively using a convex ultrasound probe LUS will be performed by an experienced radiologist according to standardized protocols. For each hemi-thorax 3 main areas (anterior (Ant), lateral (Lt) and posterior (Post)) marked by the para-sternal, anterior axillary and posterior axillary lines will be identified. Each one will be divided into upper and lower halves, making a sum of 6 different quadrants for each side: anterior superior, anterior inferior, lateral superior, lateral inferior, posterior superior, posterior inferior.&#xD;
For each quadrant a score will be assigned based on B lines which are defined as comet like artifacts indicating subpleural interstitial edema as follows:&#xD;
(0) normal aeration: A lines with lung sliding or fewer than two isolated B lines; (1) moderate loss of lung aeration: well-defined, multiple B lines ; (2) severe loss of lung aeration: multiple coalescent B lines; and (3) complete loss of lung aeration or lung consolidation.</description>
