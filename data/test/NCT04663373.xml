  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity monitoring after coronary bypass grafting and other major surgeries has&#xD;
      been found to be predictive for hospital readmission and adverse outcome. In patients after&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) it has been found that a patient reported activity&#xD;
      score is predictive of 3 year major adverse coronary event (MACE). It is not known whether&#xD;
      physical activity shortly after discharge from PCI is predictive of one-year MACE. Early&#xD;
      identification of patients at increased risk of MACE would facilitate the intensification of&#xD;
      preventive strategies in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is the quantification of physical activity (daily steps) during the first&#xD;
      two weeks after hospital discharge as a predictor for MACE at one year. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      are: 1) Comparison between daily steps and objectively measured activity counts (divided in&#xD;
      time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity, light activity and sedentary activity), as well&#xD;
      as patient reported activity; 2) Association of daily steps after one year with reaching&#xD;
      targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c); 3) Comparison of daily steps after hospital&#xD;
      discharge and MACE between non cardiac rehabilitation (CR), conventional hospital based CR,&#xD;
      tele-CR and modular CR participants; 4) Comparison of daily steps at one year after hospital&#xD;
      discharge in different CR groups.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric open label explorative study (with primary objective to assess the&#xD;
      predictive value of daily steps for MACE). Patients will be asked to wear an activity tracker&#xD;
      for two weeks following hospital discharge. Patients who participate in any form of CR in our&#xD;
      institution and attend the routine check-up 12 month after PCI in our institution will be&#xD;
      asked to wear the activity tracker again for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed about the study by the prevention team (advanced nurse&#xD;
      practitioners) usually on the day of discharge from PCI during the routine visit by this team&#xD;
      to inform patients about the different options of CR. Patients will be provided with an&#xD;
      activity tracker in the form of a wrist band, the patient information sheet including&#xD;
      informed consent (IC), the International Physical Activity Questionnaires Short-Form&#xD;
      (IPAQ-SF) and an addressed and prepaid envelope. They are asked to read the patient&#xD;
      information when arrived at home, sign the IC when willing to participate and wear the wrist&#xD;
      band continuously for two weeks after hospital discharge. After that, they should send the&#xD;
      wrist band, the filled in IPAQ-SF and signed IC in the provided envelope to our institute. If&#xD;
      they are unwilling to participate, they can send the activity tracker back straight away.&#xD;
      Patients attending the clinical routine check-up after 12 months in our institution will be&#xD;
      asked to wear the activity tracker again for two weeks.&#xD;
