  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to improve management and expedite safe discharge of&#xD;
      patients presenting with chest pain with troponin ≤14ng/l using fifth generation, 'highly&#xD;
      sensitive' troponin T. Our aim would be to specifically test in a prospective study whether&#xD;
      biomarkers for left ventricular wall stress (NT pro brain natriuretic peptide), ischaemia&#xD;
      (Heart-type fatty acid protein) and a novel marker of stress, raised in a number of&#xD;
      pathological states growth differentiation factor -15, add significantly to the prognostic&#xD;
      value of clinical information and resting ECG presenting with ischaemic sounding chest pain.&#xD;
      The 5th generation troponin assay will be used and the range of values from 1-14ng/l will&#xD;
      also be compared to the biomarkers studied in terms of hard cardiac endpoints. Recent studies&#xD;
      have indicated that very low levels of detected troponin in patients with stable coronary&#xD;
      artery disease do adversely impact on cardiac death and the development of heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chest pain accounts for up to 1% of visits to GPs in England, about 700000 visits (5%) to&#xD;
      emergency departments and up to 25% of emergency admissions to hospitals. Recent&#xD;
      epidemiological studies indicate a substantial and increasing rate of admissions with chest&#xD;
      pain even as admissions with acute myocardial infarction are falling. From 1986 to 2000 the&#xD;
      rate of admissions for chest pain in Scottish hospitals more than doubled. Further work by&#xD;
      the same group indicates that admission to hospital with angina, excluding those coded for&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome or acute myocardial infarction, is associated with a 30 day mortality&#xD;
      of 1.5%. Other studies have identified a sizable event rate in patients who have been&#xD;
      'troponin negative'. This increasing phenomenon places great strain on the NHS and indeed any&#xD;
      health provider. Any form of testing that adds significant incremental value to established&#xD;
      tests and that can effectively rule out myocardial ischaemia and moreover demonstrate good&#xD;
      medium and long-term outcome could potentially benefit both patients and the NHS delivery of&#xD;
      healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain Natriuretic Peptide Biochemical markers of left ventricular wall stress or ischaemia&#xD;
      could enhance the diagnostic accuracy of exercise tolerance tests. These have been used&#xD;
      successfully for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and in the risk&#xD;
      stratification of acute coronary syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers of acute stress&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth Differentiation Factor -15 Transforming growth Factor constitute a superfamily of&#xD;
      cytokines that exert prominent actions in adult haemostasis and adaptation by regulating cell&#xD;
      survival, proliferation and differentiation. GDF-15 is a distant member of the TGF-B&#xD;
      superfamily. In animal models it is induced in response to ischaemia-reperfusion injury,&#xD;
      pressure overload and heart failure possibly via pro-inflammatory cytokine and oxidative&#xD;
      stress dependent signalling pathways. There is both evidence of an adverse outcome in&#xD;
      patients with an elevated GDF-15 level in highly selected trials with NSTEMI as well as the&#xD;
      non-selected chest pain population. This latter analysis was a post-hoc one and there are no&#xD;
      prospective studies in an unselected chest pain population evaluating GDF-15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Type Fatty Acid Binding Protein (HFABP)- Direct evidence of myocardial ischaemia HFAP&#xD;
      is a low molecular weight protein that is involved in the intracellular uptake and buffering&#xD;
      of free fatty acids in the myocardium. It has been shown to be a sensitive and early marker&#xD;
      of myocardial infarction providing direct evidence of myocardial ischaemia as well as myocyte&#xD;
      necrosis unlike HSCRP and BNP. This is intuitive given its small molecular size and&#xD;
      consequently its propensity to be leaked from the porous membranes of ischaemic myocardial&#xD;
      cells. In the study by Kilcullen et al even Tn negative patients were well stratified by&#xD;
      HFABP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of inflammation and specifically HS-CRP Inflammatory processes play an integral part&#xD;
      in the process of atherogenesis and atherothrombosis. There is clear evidence of their&#xD;
      involvement in the processes that lead to the development of intermediate and mature&#xD;
      atheromatous plaques. Inflammatory cells and mediators are also clearly implicated in the&#xD;
      final breach between the thin fibrous cap and circulating platelets and coagulation proteins.&#xD;
      Several mediators have been investigated. These include HS-CRP, serum amyloid A,&#xD;
      myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6. They are detectable in a large proportion of patients with&#xD;
      ACS including those with no evidence of myocyte necrosis. It is not clear if these markers&#xD;
      directly contribute to the pathology of plaque destabilisation and ischaemia or whether they&#xD;
      are largely a 'byproduct' of the inflammation engendered by ischaemia and plaque rupture. CRP&#xD;
      promotes uptake of LDL cholesterol by monocytes, induces the production of tissue factor,&#xD;
      activates complement within arterial plaque as well as stimulating the expression of adhesion&#xD;
      molecules. In this regard at least it maybe postulated that CRP is a direct participant in&#xD;
      atherothrombosis. It has also been demonstrated that the measurement of Hs-CRP can grant&#xD;
      additional prognostic information to patients with negative serial cardiac troponins. However&#xD;
      both of these studies were post-hoc sub-studies of randomised controlled trials. Posthoc&#xD;
      analyses of the PROSPER study however indicated that measurement oinf HS-CRP added only a&#xD;
      small incremental prognostic value to patients at risk of vascular events. Recent results of&#xD;
      the Jupiter study gives rise for hope that inflammation as determined by CRP can improve&#xD;
      outcome if used a therapeutic decision tool for rosuvastatin treatment in patients who do not&#xD;
      fulfil criteria for primary treatment of hyperlipidaemia. This does suggest the potential&#xD;
      value of therapeutic decision making with HS-CRP albeit in a different setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for study In consecutive series of patients admitted with troponin negative chest&#xD;
      pain the investigators aim to evaluate the independent prognostic value of resting NT-pro&#xD;
      BNP, basal HFABP, GDF-15 and HS-CRP. The relationship of these markers to long term hard&#xD;
      endpoints will be investigated . The investigators aim to specifically assess whether alone&#xD;
      or in combination these can aid in the risk stratification of acute chest pain admissions&#xD;
      that do not have evidence for myocyte necrosis. A range of parameters such as the presence of&#xD;
      anaemia, ECG changes and pain characteristics will be included in a model to assess the&#xD;
      tested parameters relative effect and relationship with clinical outcome. The aim is to&#xD;
      define the independent, cumulative incremental benefit of resting NT-pro BNP, resting HFABP,&#xD;
      GDF-15 and HS-CRP and to determine whether either alone or in combination this information&#xD;
      may help improve risk stratification and ultimately therapeutic decision making in patients&#xD;
      with troponin negative chest pain.&#xD;
