  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early identification of a patient with infection who may develop sepsis is of utmost&#xD;
      importance. Unfortunately, this remains elusive because no single clinical measure or test&#xD;
      can reflect complex pathophysiological changes in patients with sepsis. However, multiple&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory parameters indicate impending sepsis and organ dysfunction. Screening&#xD;
      tools using these parameters can help identify the condition, such as SIRS, quick SOFA&#xD;
      (qSOFA), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), or Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS). The&#xD;
      2016 SCCM/ESICM task force recommended using qSOFA, while the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign&#xD;
      strongly recommended against its use compared with SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS as a single screening&#xD;
      tool for sepsis or septic shock. We hypothesised that qSOFA has greater prognostic accuracy&#xD;
      than SIRS and EWS (NEWS/NEWS2/MEWS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, medical advances in sepsis continued to focus on sepsis as a prevalent&#xD;
      condition that accounts for 10% of admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) and is&#xD;
      associated with a 10-20% in-hospital mortality rate. Standardised protocols and physician&#xD;
      awareness have significantly improved survival, but mortality rates remain between 20% and&#xD;
      36%, with ~270,000 deaths annually in the United States. However, of patients with sepsis,&#xD;
      80% are treated in an emergency department (ED), and the remainder develops sepsis during&#xD;
      hospitalisation with other conditions. In 2016, the Society of Critical Care&#xD;
      Medicine/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (SCCM/ESICM) task force redefined sepsis&#xD;
      based on organ dysfunction and mortality prediction. Sepsis now is defined as&#xD;
      life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. This&#xD;
      definition emphasises the complexity of the disease that cannot be explained by infection or&#xD;
      body response to it. Acute change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥2&#xD;
      indicates sepsis-related organ dysfunction, a predictor of excess in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
      Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and &quot;severe sepsis&quot; terms were omitted from&#xD;
      the most recent definition. SIRS has been criticised for its poor specificity, while &quot;severe&#xD;
      sepsis&quot; may underestimate sepsis's seriousness. A subset of patients may develop septic shock&#xD;
      with underlying profound organ dysfunction and excess mortality. Clinically, septic shock is&#xD;
      defined as persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) ≥ 65 mm Hg and serum lactate level ≥ 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) despite adequate volume&#xD;
      resuscitation. Early identification of a patient with infection who may develop sepsis is of&#xD;
      utmost importance. Unfortunately, this remains elusive because no single clinical measure or&#xD;
      test can reflect complex pathophysiological changes in patients with sepsis. However,&#xD;
      multiple clinical and laboratory parameters indicate impending sepsis and organ dysfunction.&#xD;
      Screening tools using these parameters can help identify the condition, such as SIRS, quick&#xD;
      SOFA (qSOFA), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), or Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS).&#xD;
      The 2016 SCCM/ESICM task force recommended using qSOFA, while the 2021 Surviving Sepsis&#xD;
      Campaign strongly recommended against its use compared with SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS as a single&#xD;
      screening tool for sepsis or septic shock. We hypothesised that qSOFA has greater prognostic&#xD;
      accuracy than SIRS and EWS (NEWS/NEWS2/MEWS).&#xD;

        All consecutive adult patients (age ≥18 years) presenting to the ED with suspected&#xD;
        infection who planned to be hospitalized and willing to give informed consent are eligible.&#xD;
        A presumptive diagnosis of infection will be judged based on the opinion of the emergency&#xD;
        physician upon the patient initial presentation to the ED. We will exclude patients with&#xD;
        evidence of other causes of presentation to the ED other than infection (e.g., autoimmune&#xD;
        diseases, myocardial infarction, trauma, …etc.), pregnant ladies, those who transferred&#xD;
        from other hospitals, or those not planned for hospitalization. We will also exclude&#xD;
        patients whose initial diagnosis of infection in the ED was not confirmed after the&#xD;
        recruitment and follow-up.&#xD;
