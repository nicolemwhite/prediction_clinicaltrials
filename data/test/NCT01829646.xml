    <textblock>
      Despite uniform histopathological definition the response of locally advanced squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) to ionizing radiation differs greatly with&#xD;
      locoregional recurrences burdening this patient population. The addition of concurrent&#xD;
      chemotherapy and the use of altered fractionation schedules has significantly increased&#xD;
      locoregional control and overall survival over the last decade however, this has come at the&#xD;
      cost of increased acute and late toxicity, preventing further treatment intensification in&#xD;
      all patients. If the investigators want to increase the therapeutic index of HNSCC, we need&#xD;
      to be able to tailor the treatment more individually to each patient. The project aims at&#xD;
      developing a prognostic model for head and neck cancer patients based on the combination of&#xD;
      known clinical parameters with 1) genetic characteristics of the tumor and 2) parameters&#xD;
      derived from diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) obtained before and during treatment. The investigators plan a prospective trial where&#xD;
      120 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy will&#xD;
      be included. Prior to treatment biopsy material will be collected for genetic analysis and&#xD;
      before and during treatment functional MRI with diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast&#xD;
      enhanced imaging will be performed. All patients will be followed up multidisciplinary&#xD;
      afterwards with follow-up of tumor status and toxicity.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND SETTING&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concurrent (chemo-) radiotherapy (CRT) is the current standard of care for patients with&#xD;
           locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The proximity of&#xD;
           important functional structures with the tumour makes treatment however highly complex.&#xD;
           While locoregional control rates have improved over the last decade, treatment related&#xD;
           toxicity can be severe with xerostomia and dysphagia gravely complicating the patient's&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, it becomes increasingly clear that while these tumours can be identical in&#xD;
           location and basic histology, their response to treatment differs greatly. This implies&#xD;
           that for a subgroup of patients, equal locoregional control rates could be achieved&#xD;
           using a less intense and consequently less toxic treatment schedule. This in contrast to&#xD;
           the group of patients who develop a locoregional recurrence during follow up, for whom&#xD;
           current treatment is apparently insufficient. These patients might benefit from a more&#xD;
           intense treatment schedule, i.e. a higher dose of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These differences in sensitivity to treatment can be explained by variations in&#xD;
           biological, molecular and genetic factors. Clinical parameters alone are insufficient&#xD;
           for response prediction. Identifying the different molecular and genetic factors, would&#xD;
           help us increase the accuracy of response prediction and based on these factors tailor&#xD;
           the treatment more individually to each patient. Therefore we want to develop a&#xD;
           prognostic and predictive model incorporating well-defined molecular and imaging&#xD;
           parameters which show great promise in response prediction after ionizing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Genetic and molecular tumour characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first parameter we want to investigate further is tumour hypoxia. Hypoxia has been&#xD;
           identified as a factor that increases tumour aggressiveness and decreases&#xD;
           radiosensitivity. In the past, several techniques have been applied to detect&#xD;
           biologically relevant tumour hypoxia, but none of them are used today in routine&#xD;
           clinical practice. Recently, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based hypoxia classifier&#xD;
           gene signature was published by Toustrup et al. This classifier allows us to study&#xD;
           biologically relevant tumour hypoxia and consequently tumour aggressiveness and&#xD;
           resistance to ionizing irradiation. This analysis will be performed on biopsies obtained&#xD;
           prior to treatment. Part of this biopsy material will also be stored into our biobank.&#xD;
           This will facilitate future research on promising molecular and genetics parameters&#xD;
           (such as HPV correlated overexpression of p16 for example) on a well-defined and&#xD;
           structured patient database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Imaging parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aside from these important molecular and genetic tumour characteristics, several&#xD;
           functional imaging parameters will also be included in our model. In contrast to&#xD;
           anatomical imaging, functional imaging modalities provide us with a deeper insight in&#xD;
           the tumour's underlying biological activity and microstructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) can characterize tissues based on&#xD;
           the random displacement of water protons. This displacement can be quantified using the&#xD;
           apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Preliminary studies in HNSCC have demonstrated the&#xD;
           prognostic and predictive potential of repetitive DWI early during and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging(DCE-MRI) is a second technique,&#xD;
           which shows great promise as an early indicator of response to ionizing radiation. Many&#xD;
           malignant tumors manifest neovascularity or angiogenesis. These processes are however&#xD;
           flawed and as a result these newly synthesized vessels manifest a high permeability,&#xD;
           tortuosity and generally a poor functionality. This might result in poor oxygen supply&#xD;
           to the tumour cells, which may compromise the effectiveness of radiation treatment of&#xD;
           the tumour. Therefore the vascular properties of a tumour, assessed with DCE-MRI, could&#xD;
           prove a prognostic indicator of its aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main objective of this study is to correlate clinical, molecular and radiological&#xD;
           predictors with outcome, as defined by locoregional control and disease free survival.&#xD;
           In this way we will develop a prognostic/predictive model. The predictive model will be&#xD;
           instrumental in the individualization of treatment ensuring optimized treatment and&#xD;
           avoiding under- and overtreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We want to get new insights in the tumor biology and microstructure by correlating&#xD;
                imaging and molecular/genetic markers in a well-defined patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We want to validate the different imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We want to make a correlation between hypoxia and other predictive biomarkers in&#xD;
                the future, by storing the tissue obtained in this study in our biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           We propose to set up a study where we will prospectively include patients with locally&#xD;
           advanced head and neck cancer who will be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy as&#xD;
           decided after multidisciplinary consultation. An outline of the trial is presented in&#xD;
           the figure below. All patients recognized eligible (non-metastatic locally advanced head&#xD;
           and neck squamous cell carcinoma, treated with chemoradiotherapy, karnofsky performance&#xD;
           status ≥ 70% and ≥ 18 years old) will be included after written informed consent.&#xD;
           Staging with a laryngoscopy, CT of the neck, MRI of the neck and a PET-CT will be&#xD;
           routinely performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CRT treatment consists of radiotherapy up to 72 Gy using an accelerated&#xD;
           hyperfractionated schedule. Day 1 and day 22 of the treatment Cisplatin at 100mg/m² will&#xD;
           be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tumour biopsies will be obtained a few days prior to treatment. The hypoxia gene&#xD;
           expression profile will be derived from the tumour material (15 genes on PCR that can be&#xD;
           analyzed individually or as a group through one binary variable).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The tissue used for RNA and DNA extraction needs to be flanked by H&amp;E staining&#xD;
           confirming tumor presence. From the biopsy the two ends will be cut off and fixed in&#xD;
           paraffin. This tissue will be stored in the biobank. The middle part of the tissue will&#xD;
           be stored into RNA-later, and will be used in part to extract DNA and RNA. RNA will be&#xD;
           used to synthesize cDNA to perform the qPCR analysis for the hypoxic classifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will also undergo a DWI MRI and DCE imaging before and 3 weeks into CRT.&#xD;
           Lesions will be quantitatively assessed by manual delineation of regions of interest&#xD;
           (ROI) over the tumour on the native DWI and DCE-MRI images. ADC values and (semi-)&#xD;
           quantitative DCE parameters will be calculated respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All the above described data will be integrated into the prognostic model together with&#xD;
           the available clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DEFINITION OF ENDPOINTS The main endpoint of this study is to validate the above&#xD;
           described prognostic model. Using this prognostic model, we can predict response to&#xD;
           treatment. This will help us to tailor the treatment more individually to each patient.&#xD;
