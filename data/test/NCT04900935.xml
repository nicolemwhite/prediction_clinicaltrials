  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to develop a supportive care model for patients with metastatic&#xD;
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to learn to cope with uncertainty and help them understand&#xD;
      their prognosis and the goal of therapy, in order to live well with cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves an intervention consisting of four sessions with palliative care&#xD;
      specialists who have been additionally trained to evaluate and address the specific&#xD;
      psychosocial issues and health-promoting behaviors of patients with NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four 60-minute visits with a trained palliative care clinician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires and an exit interview&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chart Review&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 15 participants currently receiving targeted therapy at&#xD;
      Massachusetts General Hospital for lung cancer will take part in this research study&#xD;

    <description>We will apply a previously developed natural language processing/machine learning (ML) algorithm to palliative care and oncology notes from the study period in order to identify goals of care conversations using an inductive supervised ML classifier. Notes with a predicted probability of greater than 0.5 will be classified as containing goals of care documentation.</description>
