    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death for women around the world. Notably, most&#xD;
      breast cancer patients die from tumor metastases in the liver, lungs, bones, or brain, not&#xD;
      the primary tumor itself. Currently, clinicians are generally successful in treating primary&#xD;
      tumors using standard protocols that are based on tumor sub-type and staging, as well as by&#xD;
      the presence or absence of prognostic biomarkers. However, it remains difficult to assess in&#xD;
      advance the likelihood of metastasis or relapse in any given patient.Physicians can only rely&#xD;
      on regular post-treatment screening to monitor any secondary onset. By the time metastasis is&#xD;
      detected, the golden window for treatment adjustment has often already passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes to develop an analytical tool for predicting the likelihood of&#xD;
      metastasis in breast cancer patients post-treatment using imaging and genomic data. We will&#xD;
      evaluate our prediction model using prospectively-collected patient data. This new prognostic&#xD;
      tool will enable physicians to adjust and tailor therapeutic strategies to each patient in a&#xD;
      timely manner. Overall, the tool will personalize patient care, and improve their survival&#xD;
      chances and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women around the world. According to&#xD;
      WHO statistics, 571,000 women passed away in 2015 due to breast cancer alone. In Hong Kong,&#xD;
      breast cancer is the most common cancer among women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the standard protocol in breast cancer treatment consists of surgery (mastectomy),&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and possibly hormone therapy or targeted therapy depending on the&#xD;
      presence or absence in tumor cells of certain hormone receptors such as estrogen receptors&#xD;
      (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), or human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2). The standard&#xD;
      protocol aims to remove the tumor and kill any remaining tumor cells. The treatment is&#xD;
      usually adjusted based on the patients' tolerance and general health status. The standard&#xD;
      protocol has so far been very effective in treating patients with early-stage breast cancers.&#xD;
      The 5-year relative survival rate can be higher than 90% if patients are treated early&#xD;
      enough. But it is still very challenging to treat patients with middle- or late-stage breast&#xD;
      cancers, especially those with metastatic disease. For patients with metastases, the 5-year&#xD;
      relative survival rate drops to around 20%. There are two major reasons for this drop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While all breast cancers start from the same organ, the evolution of cancer cells shows&#xD;
      different patterns in different patients. This is especially true when breast cancers are&#xD;
      advanced into the middle or late stages. The standard protocol, however, is based on averaged&#xD;
      patient statistics and does not fully account for the uniqueness of individuals. For example,&#xD;
      patients with different genomic backgrounds respond differently to the same drug dosage and&#xD;
      experience different side effects. Thus, population-based treatment strategies cannot provide&#xD;
      effective, optimal treatment for every patient, especially for patients with middle- or&#xD;
      late-stage breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical gold standard for cancer diagnosis is multi-modality imaging: mammogram and&#xD;
      ultrasound, plus pathology of biopsied tissue. Imaging has been effective in detecting&#xD;
      primary breast cancers but it becomes less effective for monitoring patients post-treatment&#xD;
      because their primary tumors and affected lymph nodes have been removed. While physicians&#xD;
      still rely on image-based screening of organs such as the lungs and liver where metastases&#xD;
      have become established to monitor their patients post-treatment, such screening tests are&#xD;
      not sensitive enough. Patients with greater risk of metastasis often miss the best window of&#xD;
      opportunity for therapy adjustment before the secondary onset. When metastasis is observed in&#xD;
      other parts of the body a few years later, often it is already too late for any effective&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients whose breast cancers are at the early stage, the standard protocol is very&#xD;
      helpful. But for patients whose breast cancers are already more advanced, the standard&#xD;
      protocol and the post-treatment monitoring tools may not be sufficient to effectively control&#xD;
      the cancer's further development and to avoid secondary onset or metastasis. If we can&#xD;
      accurately predict the occurrence of metastasis after treating the primary cancer, the&#xD;
      investigators may be able to adjust the course of intervention during the time window between&#xD;
      the primary tumor treatment and the secondary onset. Potentially, the investigators may be&#xD;
      able to delay or even avoid metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that genomic alterations are among the most important drivers&#xD;
      initiating cancer and controlling its progression, and metastases. To identify such&#xD;
      mutations, sequencing projects such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International&#xD;
      Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have systematically studied the genomes and transcriptomes of&#xD;
      thousands of cancers. As a result, many mutations which drive breast cancer have been&#xD;
      identified. But the roles of those mutations in breast cancer metastasis are still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, there are some associations between primary tumor treatments and the risk of&#xD;
      secondary onset. For example, women who receive radiotherapy after mastectomy are known to&#xD;
      have a higher risk of lung cancer. Such associations are weak, however, and have no&#xD;
      clinically-actionable implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, our team specializing in surgery, oncology, radiology, pathology, machine&#xD;
      learning, medical image analysis, single cell genomics, genomic data analysis and cancer&#xD;
      evolution will tackle the challenge of predicting post-treatment metastasis in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. Our team members have established clinical expertise and a strong track record of&#xD;
      relevant work in areas including breast cancer treatment and prognosis, multi-modality image&#xD;
      analysis for cancer detection and diagnosis, and prediction of glioblastoma relapse by&#xD;
      identifying key features of cancer evolution. Based on our extensive experience, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that combining multi-modality imaging data and genomic data,&#xD;
      collected both at the time of diagnosis and during the post-treatment follow-up period, will&#xD;
      provide sufficient information to predict the risk of metastasis despite an incomplete&#xD;
      understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Machine learning-based methods have&#xD;
      already shown great potential in tackling the issue of heterogeneity among cancer patients,&#xD;
      making it possible to build a unified tool to predict the risk of post-treatment metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such a prediction model, once developed and validated, will enable physicians to make&#xD;
      adjustments in patients' treatment. Before gaining complete insight into the biological&#xD;
      mechanism behind metastasis, such a prediction tool would offer an effective way to choose&#xD;
      the best treatment for improving each patient's quality of life and extending their life&#xD;
      span.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More importantly, such a prediction technique should potentially be generalizable to other&#xD;
      types of cancer. If so, it would have an enormous impact on clinical practice in cancer&#xD;
      treatment and post-treatment monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and Collaboration Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study design To maximize the use of existing data, the investigators will carry out a&#xD;
           retrospective study mixed with the pilot phase of a prospective study. In the&#xD;
           retrospective study the investigators will use publically-available images and genomic&#xD;
           data of breast cancer patients before and after treatment to perform image analysis,&#xD;
           feature selection, and predictor building. To compensate for the lack of matched image&#xD;
           and genomic data in the public database, the investigators will supplement it with new&#xD;
           data collected in a pilot prospective study for which the investigators will recruit 400&#xD;
           breast cancer patients. All will have undergone surgical treatment plus chemotherapy&#xD;
           and/or radiotherapy, and images and genomic data will have been collected at the time of&#xD;
           diagnosis. Matched genomic data for those patients will then be collected annually for&#xD;
           up to 4 years. Assuming an incidence of metastasis of 15% within 5 years, about 60 of&#xD;
           the patients will experience metastasis during the study. The data collected and the&#xD;
           clinical outcome metadata will be used to evaluate the predication model's accuracy and&#xD;
           in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data collection BGI Ltd. is sponsoring this project. As is explained in their supporting&#xD;
           letter, BGI will provide imaging data and genomic data from 200 breast cancer patients&#xD;
           for us to build the prediction model. That support will provide a solid foundation for&#xD;
           obtaining sufficient data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dr. Wing Cheong Chan is a breast surgeon at the North District Hospital (NDH) and is&#xD;
           also the surgeon in charge of breast surgery for the Hospital Authority's entire New&#xD;
           Territories East Cluster (NTEC). As a Honorary Clinical Assistant Professor in the&#xD;
           Department of Surgery at CUHK, Dr. Chan has already been working closely with Prof. Yeo&#xD;
           and Dr. Tse on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment for a long time. His division&#xD;
           carries out surgeries on about 260 breast cancer patients every year. He will be&#xD;
           responsible for recruiting 200 breast cancer patients with ER/PR positive or negative&#xD;
           status on a rolling basis, providing fresh tumor tissue and blood samples for genomic&#xD;
           data acquisition. Prof. Winnie Yeo is a clinical oncologist at the Prince of Wales&#xD;
           Hospital (PWH) of CUHK. She manages on average more than 500 breast cancer patients&#xD;
           every year, including those operated on at the NDH. She will be responsible for&#xD;
           monitoring the 200 breast cancer patients recruited after their surgeries and other&#xD;
           treatment, and will collect blood samples during the follow-up period. She will provide&#xD;
           relevant anonymized clinical data for building the prediction tool and will also provide&#xD;
           clinical feedback on the predictive features that the HKUST team will extract from the&#xD;
           images and genomic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prof. Winnie Chu, a radiologist, and Dr. Gary Tse, a pathologist, both at PWH, will&#xD;
           provide labeled mammograms, ultrasound images and images of biopsied tissue along with&#xD;
           biomarker data for the same 200 patients. They will then provide subsequent images and&#xD;
           other screening test data at intervals. Some patients will receive MRI scans, which will&#xD;
           also be included in the data for image-based prediction. All of the patient data will be&#xD;
           anonymized. Dr. Chan and Prof. YEO will provide clinical feedback on predictive&#xD;
           features. Please see Appendix 2 for the standard image acquisition protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prof. Angela Wu, a genomics and technology development expert in the Division of Life&#xD;
           Science and the Dept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the HKUST, will work on&#xD;
           sample preparation and genome data collection. She will collect the genomic data for the&#xD;
           analysis team. Prof. Wu has extensive experience in genomics, and in particular in the&#xD;
           area of genomic assay and technology development, as evidenced by her publications. Her&#xD;
           team will perform whole-exome sequencing (WES) and bulk RNA sequencing of patients'&#xD;
           tumors to allow identification of key mutations in protein coding regions and the&#xD;
           relationship between those mutations and gene expression. The WES and RNA-seq pipeline&#xD;
           will employ standard DNA and RNA extraction procedures followed by paired-end Illumina&#xD;
           sequencing. Cell-free DNA sequencing will also be performed annually for each patient&#xD;
           post-surgery to quantify tumor DNA in the patient's blood. The investigators will&#xD;
           attempt to correlate the results with morphological changes over time as described by&#xD;
           imaging. Cell-free DNA will be extracted using protocols adapted from which have been&#xD;
           optimized and validated in Prof. Wu's lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data analysis and predictor building The analysis team consists of four professors in&#xD;
           engineering and life sciences. They will analyze the multi-modality imaging data and the&#xD;
           genomic data, build a unified predictor, and evaluate its performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Image analysis Prof. Tim Cheng is an expert image content analysis using machine&#xD;
                learning. His team has recently developed convolutional neural networks for&#xD;
                detecting and diagnosing prostate cancer from MRI images. Prof. Albert Chung&#xD;
                specializes in medical image analysis with about 20 years of experience. Prof.&#xD;
                Weichuan Yu is expert in the analysis of ultrasound images. They will jointly&#xD;
                analyze the mammograms, ultrasound images, pathology images, and possibly MRI&#xD;
                images aiming to extract metastasis-associated image features which can be used in&#xD;
                the predictor. Candidates are 2D wavelet transform coefficients, gray level&#xD;
                co-occurrence matrix, and local binary and ternary patterns which have proved&#xD;
                useful in detecting abnormalities. Using images which have the ground-truth,&#xD;
                representative image features will be extracted to help differentiate normal,&#xD;
                benign and malignant tissues. We also will investigate different classifiers such&#xD;
                as artificial neural networks, random forest, and support vector machine for their&#xD;
                effectiveness in segmenting breast images based on the extracted features. The&#xD;
                investigators will use deep convolutional neural networks such as U-net and ResNet&#xD;
                to perform the image segmentation. The segmentation results obtained from&#xD;
                feature-based methods and from the deep learning-based methods will be fused under&#xD;
                a probabilistic framework such as the Markov random field method. That should allow&#xD;
                coupling their output in the predictor.&#xD;
&#xD;
                In short, the investigators will deploy a toolbox containing state-of-the-art&#xD;
                medical image analysis methods and combine them. The investigators will discuss the&#xD;
                extracted image features with the clinical team for feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Genomic data analysis The genome data will be analyzed by a team consisting of&#xD;
                Prof. Jiguang Wang, a computational biologist, and Prof. Weichuan Yu, with&#xD;
                expertise in genome-wide association. Profs. Tim Cheng and Albert Chung will also&#xD;
                contribute to this part of the study by applying machine learning to the genome&#xD;
                data. Prof. Wang has shown that certain brain tumors mutations seen early in the&#xD;
                cancer's development can be used to predict treatment outcomes. Those methods will&#xD;
                be adapted to the breast cancer data to predict tumor metastasis. In addition, the&#xD;
                investigators found in a preliminary study that a copy number change in ERBB2 in&#xD;
                breast cancer shows strong association with brain metastasis. This observation will&#xD;
                be further validated and justified by follow-up work in this proposed study. After&#xD;
                the investigators select the genome features as targets, the investigators will&#xD;
                work with the clinical team together to sort out the medical implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Building a metastasis predictor The investigators plan to formulate the prediction&#xD;
                task as a statistical inference problem with a Bayesian probabilistic framework.&#xD;
                All of the measurements and their uncertainty levels can then be consistently&#xD;
                modelled and mathematically integrated. For example, all measurements can be&#xD;
                represented as observations in a graphical probabilistic model and the predication&#xD;
                outcome can be inferred by estimating the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution. As&#xD;
                the investigators will be collecting data annotated by clinicians, the&#xD;
                investigators expect that model parameters can be initialized and trained&#xD;
                effectively. The investigators will also explore formulating the prediction task as&#xD;
                a classification problem and investigate using multiple, jointly co-trained&#xD;
                convolutional neural networks, each of which processes only image or genome data,&#xD;
                for performing the classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluation The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) will&#xD;
           be the main criterion to evaluate the prediction accuracy of our metastasis predication&#xD;
           tool. Currently, the best performance of breast cancer metastasis prediction by only&#xD;
           using imaging data is reported, the area under the curve (AUC) was about 55% for PAM50&#xD;
           gene assay-based risk of relapse and proliferation. Based on our survey, no method has&#xD;
           yet been proposed to use genomic data for breast cancer metastasis prediction, although&#xD;
           the genomic evolution of breast cancer metastasis and relapse has been actively&#xD;
           investigated. The investigators expect that the prediction accuracy should increase by&#xD;
           at least 5% to 10% after the investigators combine both imaging data and genomic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Mobadersany et al. has reported that the survival convolutional neural network&#xD;
      (SCNN) can surpass manual histologic-grade baseline model by combining pathology images and&#xD;
      genomic biomarkers in predicting the glioma outcome. The authors used the Harrell's c index&#xD;
      from the survival analysis perspective to measure the prediction accuracy. The median c index&#xD;
      has achieved 0.75 using the SCNN. While breast cancer is very different from glioma and AUC&#xD;
      is different from the Harrell's c index, this paper has demonstrated a positive example of&#xD;
      combining image data and genomic data in the prediction of cancer outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note that it will take much longer to observe the complete clinical outcomes of the&#xD;
      400 patients the investigators plan to recruit in this project. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      seek additional funding to continue our study after finishing this project.&#xD;
