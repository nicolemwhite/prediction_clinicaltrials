  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year approximately 3000 patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the&#xD;
      University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). In-hospital mortality of patients with emergency&#xD;
      admission approaches 25%. Predicting outcome in the first hours after ICU admission, however,&#xD;
      remains a challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An vast amount of scoring systems has been developed for mortality prediction. Well known&#xD;
      models, such as the LODS, MODS, CCI, SOFA, ODIN and the different generations of the APACHE,&#xD;
      MPM and SAPS, are increasingly compared with new models, such as the SICULA, ICNARC, ANZROD&#xD;
      and SMS-ICU. The predictive value of scoring systems deteriorates over time due to changes in&#xD;
      patient characteristics and treatment, making it crucial to update existing models or develop&#xD;
      new models. Other reasons given for the need of models are the complexity and lack of&#xD;
      availability of variables in some of the existing scoring systems, the better discriminating&#xD;
      value while using simple, standardly measured variables, and the limited generalizability of&#xD;
      some scoring systems in different patient populations. Not only are simple systems (such as&#xD;
      the CIS and SMS-ICU) found to be at least as predictive for mortality as complex models such&#xD;
      as the APACHE IV, but, while using simplified systems, mortality can also be reasonably&#xD;
      predicted within only a few hours after admission. Both simplicity and the potential to&#xD;
      predict mortality shortly after admission increase the usability, and consequently the&#xD;
      reliability, of those prediction models. This increases the potential of those models to be&#xD;
      used in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies however compare only two to four models in their patient population and lack in&#xD;
      their description of the performance of the different models. Parameters necessary to compare&#xD;
      the performance of models are at least calibration, discrimination, negative predicting&#xD;
      value, positive predicting value, sensitivity and specificity. Lacking an adequate&#xD;
      description of the performance of the model limits to what extent the study can be used to&#xD;
      compare models in different populations. Thus, all usable models should be compared with&#xD;
      newly build models, and the performance of the different models should be extensively&#xD;
      described to allow comparison of the models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not only models based on simple, readily available variables available within hours after&#xD;
      admission are promising, but also the concept of combining measurements straight after ICU&#xD;
      admission with information on the course of illness. It is likely that the course of a&#xD;
      variable over time is more indicative than a static measurement. This study will provide a&#xD;
      structure in which every patient admitted to the ICU will be investigated and included within&#xD;
      3 hours and after 12 hours after admission, making longitudinal measurements and various&#xD;
      add-on studies possible. Longitudinal measurements are the first example of an add-on study;&#xD;
      another example is the capability of nurses and physicians to predict outcome. Current&#xD;
      evidence suggests that physicians might predict mortality more accurately than scorings&#xD;
      systems. This finding may, however, be highly biased, since at least physicians play a major&#xD;
      role in end-of-life decision making. More recent studies also focus on the accuracy of nurses&#xD;
      in predicting mortality, with diverse outcomes. The role of other health care professionals,&#xD;
      like residents and students, remain to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementing a systematic data collection process is the first step towards making&#xD;
      data-driven research possible, a growing need in medical disciplines such as critical care,&#xD;
      which requires increasingly more accurate prognostic models. Therefore, the aim of this study&#xD;
      is to systematically collect data of all selected variables, thus minimizing incompleteness,&#xD;
      and allowing for the calculation of mortality prediction scores according to currently&#xD;
      available mortality or severity of disease prediction models. Moreover, during investigation&#xD;
      reliability of measurements could be checked for validity. This creates the possibility to&#xD;
      compare the performance of all models in one population and identify models which are useful&#xD;
      to predict severity of disease. A registry will be created with this primary objective which&#xD;
      also provides the opportunity to start multiple ''add-on'' studies for specific research&#xD;
      questions. Examples of add-on studies are 1) the association between time-dependent variables&#xD;
      which are longitudinally measured, and mortality/acute and chronic co-morbidity, 2) the&#xD;
      association between fluid status and acute kidney injury, and 3) not only the capability of&#xD;
      the treating physician to predict mortality, but also the capability of the nurses, residents&#xD;
      and students to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to expand the infrastructure for a registry with longitudinal&#xD;
      and repeated measurements, shortly after admittance, which is flexible to incorporate&#xD;
      temporarily added specific research questions on the outcome of critically ill patients.&#xD;

      Registry procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be included within 3 hours after their arrival on the Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit. After inclusion all study parameters will be obtained through physical and&#xD;
      physiological examination. This will be repeated at 12 circa hours, and circa 24 hours&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring will be performed by independent researchers of the department of critical care of&#xD;
      the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). Audits are planned to take place once a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients and measurements of variables will be performed by the study&#xD;
      coordinator or a co-researcher under supervision and responsibility of the principle&#xD;
      investigator. Due to its observational nature, informed consent will not be obtained for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data verification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion all conventional hemodynamic variables are derived by physical examination and&#xD;
      recording data from the basic hemodynamic monitoring (Philips ImageVue monitor with tracing&#xD;
      of heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), SpO2, arterial pressure from arterial line pressure&#xD;
      measurement and/or from non-invasively blood pressure monitoring). All variables are&#xD;
      predefined (see data dictionary) to standardize all measurements by student researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General patient characteristics and laboratory measurements were recorded from electronic&#xD;
      patient charts and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and IV,&#xD;
      Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS) scores are extracted from our local National&#xD;
      Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) database. Follow-up of all-cause mortality at 90 days and 3&#xD;
      years is acquired using the municipal personal records database. Long-term follow-up is&#xD;
      gathered through various resources, such as hospital records, family physicians and/or direct&#xD;
      contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 hours of ICU admission, all variables will be obtained through a onetime clinical&#xD;
      examination variables and nurses and physicians will be asked for their prognostications.&#xD;
      Other variables (i.e. laboratory and imaging values) will be obtained from the electronic&#xD;
      patient charts. The rationale and specific details of measuring each variable are described&#xD;
      extensively below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic circulatory variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate (HR): it will be recorded from the bedside electrocardiographic monitor. In case&#xD;
      of an irregular rhythm (i.e. atrial fibrillation) the investigators will use the mean heart&#xD;
      rate over a minute. Apart from heart rate the presence of atrial fibrillation will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP): these will be obtained by intravascular measurement using an arterial line, which is&#xD;
      part of usual care. If no arterial line inserted, the non-invasive measurement will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central venous pressure (CVP): this will be recorded in case a central venous line is present&#xD;
      in the internal jugular or subclavian vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro- and peripheral circulatory variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capillary refill time (CRT): this will be measured after 10 seconds of exerting firm pressure&#xD;
      preferably on the distal phalanx of the index finger and on the central part of the knee. No&#xD;
      cutoff score will be used, but a continuous measurement because of the discrepancy in values&#xD;
      considered normal by different researches for CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin temperature (Tskin): this will be measured subjectively and objectively. The subjective&#xD;
      measure will be conducted by palpating the patient's extremities. A distinction between&#xD;
      either 'warm' or 'cold' will be made using the dorsal surface of the hands of the examiner.&#xD;
      Patients will be considered to have 'cold' skin extremities if all examined extremities are&#xD;
      considered cool, or if only the lower extremities are cool despite warm upper extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To objectify the skin temperature, the use of a central-to-peripheral and&#xD;
      peripheral-to-ambient temperature difference (respectively dTc-p and dTp-a) or the&#xD;
      forearm-to-finger skin-temperature gradient (Tskin-diff) have been proposed in literature.&#xD;
      The investigators will make use of the central-to-peripheral measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central-to-peripheral temperature difference (dTc-p): to measure this difference the&#xD;
      investigators will compare bladder temperature, as measured by a bladder thermistor catheter,&#xD;
      with foot temperature, measured by a skin probe (DeRoyal Skin Temperature Sensor product nr&#xD;
      81-010400EU) on either the left or the right foot (dorsum). The investigators will use&#xD;
      bladder temperature as a surrogate for central temperature, and toe temperature as a&#xD;
      peripheral measure. In literature a temperature difference of either 5°C or 7 °C is generally&#xD;
      used as an upper limit. The investigators will therefore regard values higher than 7°C as&#xD;
      abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mottling score: this score was described by Ait-Oufella et al in 2011. Mottling is the&#xD;
      patchy discoloration of the skin caused by microcirculatory dysfunction. It usually involves&#xD;
      the area around the knee. The Mottling score ranges from 0 to 5, depending on the&#xD;
      extensiveness of the mottled area. A score of 0 or 1 is regarded mild, 2 or 3 moderate and 4&#xD;
      or 5 severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine output (ml/kg/h): this is also measured as part of regular care. The investigators will&#xD;
      use the total urine output before examination (i.e. from admission to examination). In&#xD;
      patients with pre-existing renal failure the urinary output will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory rate: this will be recorded of the bedside electrocardiographic monitor. If a&#xD;
      patient is on mechanical ventilation, see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation: data on the presence and type of mechanical ventilation will be&#xD;
      gathered, as well as basic information on respiratory conditions (e.g. PEEP and FiO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inotropic and vasopressor use: any inotrope or vasopressin requirement, type, dose and speed&#xD;
      will be recorded. Considered as inotropic/vasopressors are noradrenalin, vasopressin,&#xD;
      dobutamine, dopamine and milrinone. Considered as sedative are midazolam, propofol and&#xD;
      S-ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimations of pump function and peripheral circulation: an estimation will be made, either&#xD;
      by a member of the treating team, or by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum lactate, hemoglobin, troponin-T and creatinine: these are determined as part of regular&#xD;
      care. For study purposes the investigators will use the value closest to our examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other biochemical values determined as part of regular care, such as pH, leucocytes,&#xD;
      hematocrit, et cetera will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the clinical examination has been performed, information on the following general&#xD;
      characteristics will be extracted from the NICE database. This includes demographic data&#xD;
      (such as BMI, age and sex), medical history, diagnoses and severity of illness as evaluated&#xD;
      by the different generations of the APACHE scores, SAPS, the Sequential Organ Failure&#xD;
      Assessment (SOFA) and all other prediction models published. To this end, an extensive&#xD;
      literature search will be created and published and thereafter performed to ensure inclusion&#xD;
      of all published models with their variables. Furthermore, the investigators will collect&#xD;
      laboratory values (details are described above), urine output (details are described above)&#xD;
      and routine admission ECG's and imaging. After 30 days the investigators will assess the&#xD;
      patient files again to gather information on total ICU stay in days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded using OpenClinica and transferred for analysis. After transfer from&#xD;
      OpenClinica, all data will be managed in a database created using Stata version 15&#xD;
      (StataCorp, College Station, TX). All study subjects will receive a study subject ID,&#xD;
      compiled of the study name and their inclusion number. This study subject ID will be used in&#xD;
      both OpenClinica and Stata. Only a researcher with 'study director' account properties in&#xD;
      OpenClinica will be able to link study subject ID to patient number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year 3000 patients are admitted to one of four ICU units. Approximately 1500 of these&#xD;
      admissions are unplanned emergency admissions. The investigators estimate that half of these&#xD;
      unplanned admissions fulfill the inclusion criteria. This leaves 750 patients eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion. However, the investigators assume that they will not be able to include all&#xD;
      eligible patients for logistic and practical reasons. Therefore, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      include 400 patients per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the pattern underlying our missing data will be explored: missing completely at&#xD;
      random, missing at random, or missing not at random. Based on previous experience with the&#xD;
      SICS-I, it is expected that data will be missing at random. Therefore, primary analyses will&#xD;
      be conducted with imputation for missing data using multiple imputations. Robustness of&#xD;
      conclusions will be checked by secondary sensitivity analyses only including available data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the general characteristics to create a baseline table.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using Stata version 15 (StataCorp, College Station,&#xD;
      TX). Data will be presented as means with standard deviation if normally distributed or as&#xD;
      medians with ranges in case of skewed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate analyses will be conducted and all variables with p&lt;0.1 will be included in the&#xD;
      multivariate models. Multivariate analyses will be conducted using a stepwise model. Cardiac&#xD;
      output will be modeled using linear regression and mortality will be modeled using logistic&#xD;
      regression. All analyses will be adjusted for age and gender; other general characteristics&#xD;
      will not be added to the model standardly. All analyses will be tested two-sided and p-values&#xD;
      of less than 0.05 will be considered statistical significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If sample size permits, the investigators will conduct an analysis in different&#xD;
      subpopulations. Examples of subpopulations that may be eligible for further analysis are&#xD;
      those with sepsis and or severe circulatory shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future plans include the use of Machine Learning methods for further data analysis. The SOCCS&#xD;
      has been designed so that data collection is simultaneously as uniform and as vast as&#xD;
      possible. As previously described, almost all patients admitted to the ICU will be included,&#xD;
      thanks to the availability of a trained student team on-call 24 hours a day. This guarantees&#xD;
      that new patients can be included at any time, and provides the possibility of creating a&#xD;
      large set of uniform data. Many variables are registered accurately at bedside for all&#xD;
      patients acutely admitted to the ICU, within 3 hours of admission. Both more traditional as&#xD;
      well as innovative data analysis projects benefit from an optimal data collection process.&#xD;
      All data collected for the SOCCS study will be compiled in an extensive and complete&#xD;
      database, from which Machine Learning-based predictive modeling studies can easily be defined&#xD;
      and set up. At a later stage, these data will be used for building predictive or&#xD;
      risk-stratification models, which aim at probabilistically tracking the evolution of&#xD;
      critically ill patients or at highlighting potentially interesting parameters for subsequent&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence which allows data scientists to&#xD;
      design supervised or unsupervised algorithms to &quot;learn&quot; from generally large data samples by&#xD;
      means of inference. ML started as a well-known method in gene analysis, having since then&#xD;
      spread to multiple other fields of medicine. Its potential to boost clinically-oriented&#xD;
      research has been shown, primarily in identifying and prioritizing specific components of&#xD;
      care, the study of which may bring the most benefit to patients. Furthermore, the use of&#xD;
      ML-based frameworks in critical care has been reported by several authors, using different&#xD;
      types of data. These data can be obtained in different ways, with the most common being&#xD;
      through bedside measurements, such as performed for the SOCCS and SICS studies, or by&#xD;
      collecting a larger number of parameters from prior physiologic data from a group of similar&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
