  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease.&#xD;
      One of the major challenges is to better diagnose the attacks undergone by the kidney&#xD;
      transplant in order to increase its longevity. Multiple attacks are caused by non-immune and&#xD;
      immune mechanisms, first and foremost the acute rejection of the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy, an invasive method, remains the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; for diagnosing rejection and other&#xD;
      pathologies affecting the kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invasive nature of these biopsies limits their use and alternative biomarkers have been&#xD;
      evaluated in order to diagnose kidney transplant pathologies in a non-invasive manner. It is&#xD;
      in this context that the nephrology and renal transplantation department of the Necker&#xD;
      hospital and Inserm U1151 have carried out several studies leading to the identification of&#xD;
      the diagnostic and prognostic potential of acute rejection, by the determination of urinary&#xD;
      concentrations of two chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most recent study conducted within these teams demonstrated that the diagnostic potential&#xD;
      of urinary chemokines could be improved by taking into account standard clinicobiological&#xD;
      parameters in multiparametric models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to develop, train and validate artificial intelligence&#xD;
      models including urinary chemokines, efficient, robust, explainable and interpretable for the&#xD;
      diagnosis and non-invasive prognosis of acute renal transplant rejection, trained on a data&#xD;
      set made up of clinical and biological parameters.&#xD;

&#xD;
      For this, all the clinical parameters (demographic, medical history, characteristics of&#xD;
      donors, immunosuppressive treatments, etc.) and biological (follow up of the usual biological&#xD;
      parameters obtained as part of the routine care of transplant patients, urinary chemokines)&#xD;
      of transplant patients followed in the nephrology and renal transplantation department of&#xD;
      Necker hospital between 2004 and 2020, will be treated without a priori and by artificial&#xD;
      intelligence methods.&#xD;
