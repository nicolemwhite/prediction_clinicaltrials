  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evolocumab has been able to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients that&#xD;
      had at least one cardiovascular risk factor [28]. In patients with chronic HFrEF, as we&#xD;
      mentioned before, treatment with statins is not recommended as it has not shown benefits in&#xD;
      improving its prognosis. However, CAD control stands as an approach that could improve the&#xD;
      course of the disease by preventing microlesions that further weaken the heart. A recent&#xD;
      multicenter study, the BIOSTAT-CHF [3436], was performed to determine whether the PCSK9-LDLR&#xD;
      axis could predict risk in patients with HF. A multivariate analysis, which included BIOSTAT&#xD;
      risk scores, LDLR, and statin treatment as covariates, revealed a positive linear association&#xD;
      between PCSK9 levels and the risk of mortality and the composite endpoint (death or&#xD;
      HF-related hospitalization). A similar analysis for LDLR revealed a negative association with&#xD;
      mortality and the composite endpoint. Future studies must assess whether PCSK9 inhibition&#xD;
      will result in better outcomes in HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an unmet clinical need: blockade of the neurohormonal activation has provided&#xD;
      advances in patients with HFrEF, yet mortality and morbidity remain unacceptably high.&#xD;
      Approaching a strict control of lipid levels and CAD with evolocumab in stable HFrEF of&#xD;
      ischemic ethology may represent a complementary pathophysiological pathway to reduce&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. The burden of CAD provides a solid rationale for testing the value&#xD;
      of evolocumab in HF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a pilot trial is proposed to evaluate the beneficial effect of evolocumab by&#xD;
      surrogate biological markers before considering an event analysis study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evolocumab reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with established&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease, so this drug could play a role in HFrEF of ischemic etiology, by&#xD;
      limiting macro- and micro-vascular coronary disease progression. In HFrEF patients due to&#xD;
      ischemic etiology, there is a continuous troponin release due to persistent myocyte injury,&#xD;
      which has been associated with adverse outcomes. Our hypothesis is that evolocumab may have&#xD;
      the potential to reduce circulating hs-TnT levels, as a surrogate of myocyte injury due to&#xD;
      atheroma progression in HFrEF. A positive result in this EVO-HF Pilot study may lead to the&#xD;
      set-up of a large-scale multicenter prospective and randomized events study analyzing the&#xD;
      role of lipid-lowering treatment by means of evolocumab in HFrEF of ischemic etiology&#xD;
