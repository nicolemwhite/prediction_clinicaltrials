      EVAREST will identify and validate novel blood and imaging biomarkers of potential value for&#xD;
      consistent and accurate interpretation of stress echocardiography. During phase one, blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected to assess the impact of cardiac stress on levels of circulating&#xD;
      biomarkers and examine whether the measurement of these biomarkers can provide additional&#xD;
      prognostic information. Phases one, two and three will also determine whether novel imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers can be identified in the echocardiograms that can be used for objective&#xD;
      interpretation of the stress echocardiograms. EVAREST will recruit up to 8000 patients (First&#xD;
      500 during phase one, an additional 500 during phase two and an additional 7000 during phase&#xD;
      three) from multiple hospitals across United Kingdom, who have been referred for a stress&#xD;
      echocardiogram as part of their investigations into ischaemic heart disease. Phase four of&#xD;
      the study will continue into a clinical study cohort phase to capture information from all&#xD;
      patients referred for a stress echocardiogram in the UK, regardless of the reason for&#xD;
      investigation.This registry phase will run for 2 years, recruiting up to 15000 participants.&#xD;

      Study Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVAREST is a multi-centre observational study comparing accuracy of novel quantitative stress&#xD;
      echocardiography biomarkers for prediction of 12 month outcome against standard clinical&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Scientific Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease affects 2.3 million people in the UK and is responsible for 66 000&#xD;
      deaths each (BHF, 2018). As such, early diagnosis and intervention is crucial for saving&#xD;
      lives and improving people's quality of life. Stress echocardiography is a commonly used,&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging test used for detection of prognostically significant coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. It allows the detection of regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) which develop&#xD;
      when the myocardium is not receiving adequate perfusion and, as such, indicates obstructive&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. Average sensitivity and specificity for stress echocardiography is&#xD;
      estimated at 81% and 82%, respectively (Geleijnse et al., 2009) in meta-analysis but remains&#xD;
      highly subjective (Hoffmann et al., 1996) and subject to operator skill (Picano et al.,&#xD;
      1991). Objective, quantifiable biomarkers in blood samples, or from images, acquired during&#xD;
      the stress echocardiogram, which predict outcome of patients, could be used to reduce&#xD;
      variability of stress echocardiography and ensure consistent and accurate results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish whether the measurement of specific blood biomarkers, in particular,&#xD;
           extracellular vesicles, during a stress echocardiogram, can give additional prognostic&#xD;
           information to stress echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish whether imaging biomarkers can provide additional prognostic information to&#xD;
           stress echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase One&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase one will investigate the impact of cardiac stress on the levels of circulating&#xD;
      biomarkers, in particular, extracellular vesicles. This phase will also assess whether they&#xD;
      provide further prognostic information in addition to the echocardiogram. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected from a cannula (inserted for the standard clinical procedure) before stress,&#xD;
      during peak stress and during recovery and analysed to determine whether there were any&#xD;
      changes in circulating extracellular vesicles during these three stages and whether these&#xD;
      differ between patients with and without ischaemic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Two&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase two continues recruitment for collection of stress echocardiogram images. Data&#xD;
      collected during this phase will be compared with the data obtained during phase one to&#xD;
      assess the usefulness of incorporating blood biomarkers into assessment of stress&#xD;
      echocardiograms. In addition, the images obtained during phase two will be combined with the&#xD;
      images collected during phase one to allow for the identification of novel imaging biomarkers&#xD;
      which can be used to assist in the identification of patients with prognostically significant&#xD;
      coronary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Three&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase three will expand recruitment to allow evaluation of the generalisability of the&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers identified in phase one and two across different healthcare settings,&#xD;
      operators, stress protocols, machines and patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Four&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth phase of the study allows for an assessment of all stress echocardiography&#xD;
      practise in the UK and the demographics of patients being referred for stress echocardiogram.&#xD;
      Phase four will investigate the use of stress echocardiography as a clinical procedure in the&#xD;
      UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Recruitment, Consent and Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been scheduled a stress echocardiogram (using either pharmacological or&#xD;
      exercise stress) as part of clinical investigations will be sent a participant information&#xD;
      leaflet to read prior to their clinic appointment. When they are in the department, they will&#xD;
      be approached by a study investigator to see whether they would be interested in taking part&#xD;
      in the study and have the opportunity to ask the investigator any questions so that they&#xD;
      fully understand the study. If they are interested in taking part, the process of obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, the images acquired during the stress echocardiogram will be downloaded&#xD;
      and anonymised with the participant's unique study ID number. These images will be&#xD;
      transferred to the Oxford Research Echocardiography Core Laboratory (ORECL) for further&#xD;
      analysis. Relevant medical history will be obtained for each participant as well as the&#xD;
      clinician's interpretation of the echocardiogram. One year after the initial stress&#xD;
      echocardiogram (range: 11-18 months), the participant will be followed-up to determine&#xD;
      whether they underwent any further investigations for ischaemic heart disease (such as&#xD;
      coronary angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy&#xD;
      or repeat stress echocardiography) or had any coronary events. The participant may also be&#xD;
      contacted via telephone to find out whether they were admitted to any other hospital for&#xD;
      investigations. For phase one participants only, three blood samples (totalling approximately&#xD;
      40 ml) will be obtained before, at peak stress and after a recovery period, for the&#xD;
      assessment of blood biomarkers. These samples will be taken through the cannula inserted as&#xD;
      is routine during stress echocardiography. Participants will also give consent for follow-up&#xD;
      information to be accessed for up to ten years after their initial stress echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Outcome Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient outcomes will be examined by an adjudication committee, blinded to the results of the&#xD;
      stress echocardiograms. This committee will be led by a cardiologist and will examine all&#xD;
      information obtained for a participant after the follow-up period has concluded. The criteria&#xD;
      for confirming the presence of significant coronary artery disease include &gt; 70% stenosis&#xD;
      (assessed either via invasive coronary angiography or CT coronary angiography), an FFR &lt; 0.85&#xD;
      or disease requiring intervention (either by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG)). Other end-points include coronary events (such as&#xD;
      myocardial infarction) or death (attributed to coronary artery disease). If a patient has had&#xD;
      no further investigations or events since their stress echocardiogram, their outcome will be&#xD;
      recorded as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data obtained will be securely stored in accordance with the General Data Protection&#xD;
      Regulations and Data Protection Act (2018) and Caldicott Principles.&#xD;
