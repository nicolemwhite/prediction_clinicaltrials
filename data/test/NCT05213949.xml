  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pyogenic liver abscess is one of the most common visceral abscesses, its incidence is&#xD;
      increasing worldwide. According to the previous literature, the mortality rate of pyogenic&#xD;
      liver abscess is as high as 31% and become a serious social health problem. However, the data&#xD;
      of prospective observational real-world studies are scarce and no relevant research of the&#xD;
      liver histological change has been reported, so the long-term prognosis and the risk factors&#xD;
      for pyogenic liver abscess are still unknown. Patients will be followed up prospectively for&#xD;
      a period of 2 years and observed clinical prognosis (all-cause mortality, the recurrence&#xD;
      rate, and the rehospitalization rate). The investigators will investigate the predictive&#xD;
      value of clinical risk factors for clinical prognosis and establish clinical prediction&#xD;
      models to predict the long-term prognosis of pyogenic liver abscesses.&#xD;
