  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are prospectively validating a prognostic clinical tool that uses a&#xD;
      patient's modified Bauer grade, ambulatory status, and pre-operative serum albumin to predict&#xD;
      survival, post-treatment morbidity, and functional outcomes in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      disease involving the spine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recently, the investigators proposed a clinical prediction score that used a patient's&#xD;
      modified Bauer grade, ambulatory status, and pre-operative serum albumin as a means to&#xD;
      predict long-term survival following spine surgery for metastatic disease. This prognostic&#xD;
      utility was developed using one-year mortality as the sole outcome measure. While the scoring&#xD;
      system demonstrated many of the necessary attributes of a useful prediction tool, including&#xD;
      simplicity, ease of use and clinical utility, it has yet to be validated prospectively and&#xD;
      its capacity to predict other peri-operative outcomes, including physical and mental function&#xD;
      following intervention, pain relief and the risk of complications, remain incompletely&#xD;
      explored. To further evaluate the utility of this prognostic score, the investigators propose&#xD;
      a series of three integrated experiments that will prospectively determine its capacity to&#xD;
      accurately inform clinical decision making and recommendations for surgery for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic spinal disease.&#xD;
