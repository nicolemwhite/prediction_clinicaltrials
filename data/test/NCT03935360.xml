  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a common presentation in the Emergency Room. It can&#xD;
      deteriorate into severe adverse event. However some are discharged before these events occur.&#xD;
      The Oakland-Jairath score was developed to help determine which patients can be safely&#xD;
      discharged and which should be admitted from the ER to the hospital. The score did well in&#xD;
      its development, but now needs to be externally validated by other independent cohorts. The&#xD;
      limitations of the first study will be addressed in our study. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      perform the first prospective, multi-centered, external validation of the Oakland-Jairath&#xD;
      risk score on an independent and diverse population who present to the emergency room with&#xD;
      LGIB.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of critical importance in the approach to care of these patients is differentiating the&#xD;
      majority of people who can be safely discharged for outpatient management from those who are&#xD;
      at risk for serious adverse events and require hospitalization. Recently, Oakland and Jairath&#xD;
      developed a clinical prediction rule for safe discharge among patients with LGIB using data&#xD;
      from their UK National Audit. The next step in the development of a clinical prediction rule&#xD;
      is external validation in independent cohorts. Measures of predictive accuracy for risk&#xD;
      scores, such as the AUC, are overly optimistic when calculated from the derivation cohort&#xD;
      from which the risk score was derived. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate its performance&#xD;
      using independent and diverse validation cohorts. Thus, the goal of this study is to perform&#xD;
      the first prospective, multi-centered, external validation of the Oakland-Jairath risk score&#xD;
      on an independent and diverse population who present to the emergency room with LGIB. This is&#xD;
      a prospective multi-centre observational study to externally validate the Oakland-Jairath&#xD;
      LGIB risk score, herein referred to simply as the &quot;risk score&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients presenting to hospital over a 6 month period will have their risk score&#xD;
      calculated and followed for the development of an adverse outcome over a 28 day period. The&#xD;
      risk score will be determined for research purposes only but will be shared with the treating&#xD;
      physician if requested as the details of the risk score itself is within the public domain.&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible regardless of discharge status and all admission decisions will be&#xD;
      made solely by the treating physicians. To increase the diversity of the validation cohort,&#xD;
      increase generalizability, and hasten recruitment, the study will be conducted at 4 centres:&#xD;
      Western University, University of Alberta, University of Montreal, and McGill University.&#xD;

i. Rebleeding, defined as [additional blood transfusions] or [a further decrease in hematocrit concentration of 20% or more], both after 24h clinical stability ii. Readmission for LGIB within 28 days iii. Red blood cell transfusion iv. Therapeutic intervention for hemostasis (endoscopic/IR/surgery) v. Death within 28 days</description>

    <description>Oakland and Jairath developed a clinical prediction rule for safe discharge among patients with LGIB using data from their UK National Audit. They defined safe discharge as the absence of rebleeding, blood transfusion, need for endoscopic/radiologic/surgical intervention for hemostasis, readmission with LGIB, and death and developed a seven variable risk score: age, sex, previous history of LGIB admission, presence of blood on digital rectal exam, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin. Using a cut-off score ≤8, they reported excellent discrimination (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.82-0.86), good calibration, and a 95% probability of safe discharge.</description>
