  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the ICU in a tertiary burn centre in Kuwait were analysed using multiple&#xD;
      mortality prediction scores. The accuracy of these scores were compared to each other to&#xD;
      ascertain which prediction modality provides the most accurate prognosis.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to determine the accuracy of three established scoring systems used&#xD;
      for burn patients admitted to the intensive care unit and to determine the risk factors&#xD;
      associated with poor outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 211 patients with who were admitted to the ICBU in a tertiary care centre in&#xD;
      Kuwait from January 2017 to December 2019 were analysed retrospectively. Data were collected&#xD;
      using patient medical records. The FLAMES, BOBI and revised Baux scores were calculated, and&#xD;
      the survivor and non-survivor scores of patients were analysed to determine the sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) of the different&#xD;
      scoring modalities.&#xD;
