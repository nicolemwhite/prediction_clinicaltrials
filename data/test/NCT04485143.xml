  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) are the&#xD;
      golden treatments for stable coronary artery disease (CAD) combined with heart failure (HF).&#xD;
      The goal of treating HF patients is to prevent repeated hospitalizations and improve&#xD;
      peri-operative survival; clinically, although routines including beta-receptor inhibitors,&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and mineralocorticoids have been shown&#xD;
      beneficial for the prognosis, for patients with severely low left ventricular ejection rate,&#xD;
      hypotension, and pulmonary disease, the introduction of these drugs in the early&#xD;
      postoperative period should still be cautious and may need to be adjusted with related&#xD;
      cardiovascular function parameters. Patients with low cardiac output syndrome, ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmia, or hemodynamic instability should be suspected of the failure of bypass grafts if&#xD;
      accompanied by changes in the electrocardiogram (EKG) and an increase in myocardial enzymes.&#xD;
      Intervention should be carried out as soon as possible after angiography detects graft&#xD;
      failure to limit the occurrence of large-scale myocardial injury and prevent the development&#xD;
      of severe myocardial failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is start on June 1 2020. And will include 400 patients who have just undergone PCI&#xD;
      and 300 CABG patients who diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease. We will register their&#xD;
      medical history, medications, and routine medical examinations within one year, and perform&#xD;
      tests such as phonocardiography (Audiocor). They will be worn and measured daily at home&#xD;
      after discharge. The data of the electrocardiogram and the PPG bracelet will be registered&#xD;
      with their continuous daily values. All subjects tracked the occurrence of adverse medical&#xD;
      events within one year after discharge from the hospital. Based on the home-based remote&#xD;
      personal care model for patients with CABG, a risk prediction model for heart failure and&#xD;
      vascular restenosis was established to effectively reduce medical treatment, adverse events,&#xD;
      and medical expenditure.&#xD;

      This study is open, prospective study, multi-center, randomized controlled trial, unobtrusive&#xD;
      research. This study is start on June 1 2020. And will include 400 patients who have just&#xD;
      undergone PCI and 300 CABG patients who diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease. And&#xD;
      random allocation 350 experimental group (Non-invasive Wearable Device) and 350 control group&#xD;
      (routine medical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ask whether the patients who meet the exclusion criteria are willing to participate in the&#xD;
      screening (Screening), if they are willing to join and sign the consent of the subject, and&#xD;
      after the patient's condition is stable, conduct an electrocardiogram (V0) before discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital. On day 7 (±2 weeks), day 84 (±4 weeks), 168 days (±4 weeks), 252 days (±4&#xD;
      weeks), 336 days (±8 weeks) during routine clinical referral (V1-V5) Both are done once. The&#xD;
      results of these two tests and other basic information of the patient, including Demography,&#xD;
      Vital Signs, High, Weight, Medication, and European and Taiwan Cardiology Association&#xD;
      recommended routine test results of high-risk patients, including Blood Chemistry Panel,&#xD;
      NT-proBNP, Echocardiography, Myocardial Perfusion Scan, etc., will record the information of&#xD;
      the logged-in subjects on the paper case report form. The CRF only displays the study number,&#xD;
      and no subject is available. In addition to the examination of each return visit, the&#xD;
      subjects also took the ECG bracelet home at the time of discharge (V0) and wore it every day.&#xD;
      After the discharge, the ECG was measured every morning and evening, and their personal&#xD;
      activity and sleep were collected. Relevant information. After the subject was discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital, the subject tracked the date of all adverse events due to cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease within one year, including: heart failure, restenosis due to blood vessel, and&#xD;
      non-fatal myocardial infarction , To do blood vessel-related surgery again, and data on the&#xD;
      occurrence of death.&#xD;
