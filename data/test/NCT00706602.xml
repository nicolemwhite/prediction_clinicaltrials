    <textblock>
      Background: COPD is a systemic illness; morbidity and mortality due to this disease are on&#xD;
      the increase, and it has great impact on patients' lives. Most COPD patients are managed by&#xD;
      general practitioners (GP). GPs base their initial assessment of patients' disease severity&#xD;
      mainly on lung function and then inform patients about adequate treatment. However, lung&#xD;
      function correlates poorly with COPD-specific health-related quality of life and exacerbation&#xD;
      frequency. Preventive cardiology embraced risk index-guided treatment successfully. COPD&#xD;
      disease severity indices that better represent the clinical manifestations of COPD are needed&#xD;
      that can be used to guide risk-stratified treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: (1) The development and validation of a practical COPD disease severity index to&#xD;
      predict the course of health-related quality of life over time. (2) The validation of the&#xD;
      ADO-Index (Age, Dyspnea, Obstruction) to predict 3-year mortality in COPD patients in primary&#xD;
      care. (3) Link evidence on treatment effects to the COPD risk indices to guide COPD treatment&#xD;
      selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We are in the process of conducting two linked prospective cohort studies with 413&#xD;
      COPD patients (GOLD stages 2-4) from GPs in Switzerland and the Netherlands. We performed a&#xD;
      sound baseline assessment including detailed patient history, lung function, measurement of&#xD;
      exercise capacity and blood sampling. During the follow-up of at least five years, we update&#xD;
      the patients' profile by registering health status, exacerbations and health-related quality&#xD;
      of life and, after 2 years, lung function and measurement of exercise capacity. For aim 1, we&#xD;
      will identify the best combination of variables predicting the course of health-related&#xD;
      quality of life over time using multivariable regression analysis. For aim 2, we will assess&#xD;
      discrimination and calibration of the ADO index to predict 3-year mortality. For aim 3, we&#xD;
      will estimate treatment effects for individual patient profiles using complex statistical&#xD;
      models such as Markov models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of project: After this study, different risk scores will be available for use in&#xD;
      primary care so that general practitioners can estimate what impact COPD will have on the&#xD;
      patients. By linking these risk scores to evidence form treatment studies, it will be&#xD;
      possible to show for an individual patient how COPD and different treatments impacts on&#xD;
      mortality, symptoms and exacerbations. Thereby, patients and physicians can make more&#xD;
      informed treatment decisions balancing the benefits and downsides of different treatments.&#xD;
