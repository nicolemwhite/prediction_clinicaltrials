  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the progress made in the management of myocardial infarction (MI), the associated&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality remains high. Numerous scientific data show that damage of the&#xD;
      coronary microcirculation (CM) during a STEMI remains a problem because the techniques for&#xD;
      measuring it are still imperfect. We have simple methods for estimating the damage to the MC&#xD;
      during the initial coronary angiography, the best known being the calculation of the&#xD;
      myocardial blush grade (MBG), but which is semi-quantitative and therefore not very precise,&#xD;
      or more precise imaging techniques, such as cardiac MRI, which are performed 48 hours after&#xD;
      the infarction and which make the development of early applicable therapeutics not very&#xD;
      propitious. Finally, lately, the use of special coronary guides to measure a precise CM index&#xD;
      remains non-optimal because it prolongs the procedure. However, the information is in the&#xD;
      picture and this information could allow the development of therapeutic strategies adapted to&#xD;
      the patient's CM. Indeed, the arrival of iodine in CM increases the density of the pixels of&#xD;
      the image, this has been demonstrated by the implementation in 2009 of a software allowing&#xD;
      the calculation of the MBG assisted by computer. But the performances of this software did&#xD;
      not allow its wide diffusion. Today, the field of medical image analysis presents dazzling&#xD;
      progress thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). Deep Learning, a sub-category of Machine&#xD;
      Learning, is probably the most powerful form of AI for automated image analysis today. Made&#xD;
      up of a network of artificial neurons, it allows, using a very large number of known&#xD;
      examples, to extract the most relevant characteristics of the image to solve a given problem.&#xD;
      Thus, it uses thousands of pieces of information, sometimes imperceptible to the naked eye.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a supervised Deep Learning algorithm trained with a set of relevant data,&#xD;
      will be able to identify a patient with a pejorative prognosis, probably related to a&#xD;
      microcirculatory impairment visible in the image.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to develop an algorithm capable of identifying patients with poor&#xD;
      prognosis criteria at the time of hospitalization for STEMI, despite successful&#xD;
      revascularization by analyzing coronary angiography images using supervised Deep Learning&#xD;
      type artificial intelligence methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be subdivided into 4 steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Step 1: Patient selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data mining to identify and select patients via PMSI data. Patients will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone follow-up to check the participation agreement and collect the primary outcome.&#xD;
      Other data from the patient's medical file will be collected through PREDIMED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Step 2: Data annotation&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify for each patient with successful revascularization according to the usual&#xD;
      criteria (TIMI Flow = 3, MBG = 2 or 3 and ST segment resolution &gt; 70%) whether or not he or&#xD;
      she presents, at the time of hospitalization for STEMI, pejorative evolution criteria defined&#xD;
      by the occurrence of death or rehospitalization for heart Failure at the time of follow-up .&#xD;
      This step requires the expertise of an angioplastician and will result in the generation of a&#xD;
      database of 600 cases. To train the algorithm to recognize images in the context of STEMI&#xD;
      revascularization, 1000 normal coronary angiographies performed in a stable disease context&#xD;
      will also be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Step 3: Development of a new method for analyzing coronary angiography images to identify&#xD;
      patients with non-optimal revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Develop using Tensorflow/Keras libraries a supervised Deep Learning AI algorithm trained to&#xD;
      identify patients with non-optimal revascularization (patient with poor prognosis). The&#xD;
      algorithm will be based on convolutional neural network methodology and the model will be&#xD;
      trained using data from the two previous steps. All or part of the sequence of interest will&#xD;
      be used at the input of the model which will propose at the output a probability of good or&#xD;
      bad prognosis of the patient.The 1000 complementary coronary angiographies will be used to&#xD;
      artificially increase the learning base by increasing the number of cases or will be&#xD;
      exploited for a transfer learning method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Step 4: Evaluation of the pathophysiological hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main weakness of AI is the &quot;Black Box&quot;. That is, the algorithm can predict correctly&#xD;
      without knowing how. It is then difficult to link the result to a physiopathological&#xD;
      phenomenon and to develop therapeutics. Here we will evaluate the correlation of the&#xD;
      algorithm's result with the reference method for measuring CD used in the patients of the&#xD;
      Guardiancory study (NCT03087175).&#xD;
