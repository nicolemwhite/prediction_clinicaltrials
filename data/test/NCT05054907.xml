    <textblock>
      This study is going to use wearable devices and smartphones to collect physical data from&#xD;
      terminal patients and build a survival predicting model for terminal patients with machine&#xD;
      learning. Investigators hypothesize that continuous physical data monitoring could offer a&#xD;
      hint to better predictability in end-of-life care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aim to examine the feasibility of utilizing wearable devices and smartphones in&#xD;
      palliative patients in Taiwan. In addition, investigators try to identify the relationship&#xD;
      between mobile health data and disease progression and establish a predicting model to the&#xD;
      emergent medical need and death of patients, via machine learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm observational study using wearable devices and smartphones in terminal&#xD;
      cancer patients. Investigators planned to enroll 75 patients who receive palliative care.&#xD;
      After obtaining consent from the patients or their legally authorized surrogate&#xD;
      decision-makers, a baseline assessment will be conducted, with a guide to use wearable&#xD;
      devices and phone apps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will keep regular follow-up for 26 weeks or until the participants' death.&#xD;
      Assessment will be conducted every week, face-to-face or by telephone contact. A routine&#xD;
      assessment includes symptoms and functionality in the past week, and vital signs and facial&#xD;
      photograph will be recorded if possible. Physical data measured from wearable devices would&#xD;
      be recorded continuously. The emergent medical needs of patient, including emergency&#xD;
      department visit, unplanned admission and death of participants will be recorded if happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the predictive performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the&#xD;
      machine-learning model using wearable device data and symptoms assessment. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are symptoms, including pain, dyspnea, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      insomnia, depression, anxiety and fatigue. Users' opinion and comment to using experience&#xD;
      will also be recorded.&#xD;
