      In a cohort of symptomatic patients referred to coronary computed tomography angiography&#xD;
      (CCTA), the investigators aim is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate and compare the diagnostic precision of Rubidium Positron Emission&#xD;
           Tomography (Rb PET) and 15O-water PET (15O-water PET) in patients where CCTA does not&#xD;
           exclude obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) using invasive coronary angiography&#xD;
           with fractional flow reserve (ICA-FFR) as reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of computed tomography fractional&#xD;
           flow reserve (CT-FFR) in patients where CCTA does not exclude obstructive CAD with&#xD;
           ICA-FFR as reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validated a pre-test probability model including genetic and circulating biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify and characterize genetic risk variants and circulating biomarkers importance&#xD;
           in developing CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the bone mineral density in the hip and spine and correlate this to the&#xD;
           degree of vascular calcification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CCTA has become the preferred diagnostic modality for symptomatic patients with low to&#xD;
      intermediate risk of CAD. Of the patients examined, CCTA exclude cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      70-80% with an excellent negative predictive value of more than 95%. Having a low positive&#xD;
      predictive value, however, CCTA often overestimates the severity of CAD, especially in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe coronary calcification. Following CCTA, patients are hence&#xD;
      unnecessarily tested using golden standard ICA-FFR. These ICAs often show no obstructive&#xD;
      coronary stenosis and are therefore not followed by revascularization. The issues outlined&#xD;
      raises the question of whether it is possible (1) to make a more precise risk stratification&#xD;
      and consequently better selection of patients prior to CCTA and (2) to reduce the number of&#xD;
      patients referred for unnecessary ICAs following CCTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with suspicion of coronary stenosis detected by CCTA, current guidelines&#xD;
      recommend verification of myocardial ischemia. Dan-NICAD 3 investigate the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of advanced non-invasive myocardial perfusion imaging tests; Rb PET and 15O-water&#xD;
      PET. These examinations have shown a high diagnostic accuracy in symptomatic patients with&#xD;
      high risk of ischemic heart disease. However, the diagnostic accuracy is not investigated in&#xD;
      patients as follow-up after CCTA. In addition, microcirculation may impact the correlation&#xD;
      between PET and ICA-FFR which this study will investigate further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative way to increase the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA and thus avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      downstream testing using ICA is to utilize the ability to extract physiological information&#xD;
      from the anatomical CCTA images. CT-FFR has in previous studies shown promising results. In&#xD;
      addition, calculated estimation of microcirculatiory function is under development and this&#xD;
      study will validated these algorithms. Furthermore, the prognostic value of CT-FFR is unknown&#xD;
      and will be tested in the pooled cohort of Dan-NICAD 1, 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtained during ICA, quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a novel wire-free approach for fast&#xD;
      computation of FFR with potential to increase the global use of physiological lesion&#xD;
      assessment. QFR is superior to traditional assessment of intermediate coronary lesions based&#xD;
      on quantitative coronary analysis of ICA. However, disagreement between ICA-FFR and QFR has&#xD;
      been identified in up to 20% of all measurements. QFR will be validated compared to PET and&#xD;
      ICA-FFR.&#xD;
