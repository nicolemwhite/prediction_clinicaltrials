    <textblock>
      For the appropriate individualized treatment of T1-stage renal cell carcinoma with&#xD;
      heterogeneous biological features, the expression of PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, KDM5C and the newly&#xD;
      proposed FOXC2 and CLIP4, are compared with clinical features. The investigators evaluated&#xD;
      the efficacy of FOXC2 and CLIP4 as prognostic biomarkers and developed a high risk prediction&#xD;
      model based on these results. In a previous study, the investigators evaluated the efficacy&#xD;
      of FOXC2 and CLIP4 as prognostic biomarkers and reported their association with synchronous&#xD;
      metastasis in renal cell carcinomas less than 7 cm in size. The investigators analyzed the&#xD;
      expression level of renal cell carcinoma according to the size and malignancy (Fuhrman grade)&#xD;
      of renal cell carcinoma in T1-stage clear cell type renal cell carcinoma of tumor size less&#xD;
      than 7cm. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of tumor recurrence or&#xD;
      metastasis, cancer specific survival rate, overall survival rate, tumor size, malignancy and&#xD;
      T stage in postoperative biopsy. For expression analysis, PCR amplification and bidirectional&#xD;
      Sanger sequencing and mRNA expression analysis (qRT-PCR) were used. For statistical analysis,&#xD;
      Fisher exact test, Wilcoxon exact 2-tailed test, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis&#xD;
      and competing risk method were used. In this study, the investigators compared the expression&#xD;
      of PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, and KDM5 with newly proposed biomarkers, FOXC2 and CLIP4 and&#xD;
      demonstrate the prognostic value of FOXC2 and CLIP4 as new prognostic biomarkers and compared&#xD;
      the clinical outcomes with the clinical outcome. Based on these results, the investigators&#xD;
      propose a high risk prediction model for individualized treatment of T1-stage renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. This study is expected to establish a new prediction model and molecular biologic&#xD;
      stage for risk stratification of T1-stage renal cell carcinoma patients and apply genetic&#xD;
      test for selection of optimal tailored treatment for T1-stage renal cell carcinoma. In&#xD;
      addition, it will be an important basic data of the molecular biologic mechanism of&#xD;
      metastasis in early renal cell carcinoma and may be used as a basic data for the development&#xD;
      and selection of customized therapeutic agents in patients with distant metastasis.&#xD;
