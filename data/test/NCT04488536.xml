      Background Patients less than 80 years of age, who suffer a myocardial infarction (MI) are&#xD;
      usually (&gt;90%) offered an early invasive strategy including coronary angiography possibly&#xD;
      followed by intervention, preferably percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Among non&#xD;
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients, 80 years of age or over, only&#xD;
      approximately 40% receive an invasive approach in Sweden, since the majority are handled in a&#xD;
      conservative way, i.e. with medical treatment only. Furthermore, as with pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment, there is a large variation between Swedish counties regarding the choice of&#xD;
      strategy for the treatment of elderly (80+) patients with NSTEMI with an even larger&#xD;
      variation between acute hospitals ranging from 20% to 90 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swedish national guidelines for heart disease have emphasized that the patient's&#xD;
      biological age, i.e. the patient's biological status and expected length of life, is crucial&#xD;
      for decision-making. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a global clinical measure of&#xD;
      biological age, mixing co-morbidity, disability and cognitive impairment. The investigators&#xD;
      have previously reported the potential importance of frailty for short-term (1 month) and&#xD;
      medium-term outcome (1 year) in a NSTEMI population. However, published data on the role of&#xD;
      frailty´s prognostic value, its capacity to predict adverse effects including complications,&#xD;
      and the potential to guide clinical decision-making for elderly patients with myocardial&#xD;
      infarction are scarce. Similarly, there is a lack of knowledge of how different patterns of&#xD;
      comorbidity burden might influence rational decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims To explore the association between frailty and treatment patterns in cardiac care To&#xD;
      study the association between outcomes and degree of frailty, with and without comprehensive&#xD;
      adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how treatment benefits for patients admitted to coronary care units differ in&#xD;
      patients depending on comorbidities and frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that frailty is independently associated with worse&#xD;
      outcomes, including mortality, readmissions and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and material An observational, register based, multicentre study. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
      Patients consecutively included in the Swedish Web-System for Enhancement and Development of&#xD;
      Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies&#xD;
      (SWEDEHEART) registry. Exclusion criteria: None.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWEDEHEART is a national quality registry collecting information on all patients hospitalized&#xD;
      with MI or suspected MI. All 72 Swedish hospitals with acute coronary care contribute with&#xD;
      data. Briefly, information is collected prospectively about individual patients' medical&#xD;
      history, treatment before admission, management during hospital stay, treatment at discharge,&#xD;
      and diagnoses. Approximately 20.000 patients diagnosed with MI are included in this register&#xD;
      per year. From January 1st 2020 frailty (CFS) is a mandatory variable in the registry.&#xD;
      However, as a pilot project to ensure feasibility, five hospitals began to register frailty&#xD;
      November 1st, 2017. For the investigators initial analyses data will be used from the pilot&#xD;
      study to assess the association between CFS level and outcomes. The data extraction will be&#xD;
      done by one of the monitors of the SWEDEHEART registry. After about two years the&#xD;
      investigators will extract data prospectively entered into the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frailty instrument The crucial study instrument CFS is a 9-point scale. It has good&#xD;
      predictive validity and prognostic power, is relying on clinical judgment, and is relatively&#xD;
      easily used in clinical practice. Since the scale includes several degrees it can be&#xD;
      considered to be particularly appropriate for risk stratification, and accordingly it has&#xD;
      been used for this purpose. The investigators have got the instrument owner´s permission to&#xD;
      use this scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The case record form (CRF) focus on demographic and clinical patient characteristics&#xD;
      registered in the SWEDEHEART, particularly those which are supposed to be potential&#xD;
      confounders when testing the hypothesis: chronological age, gender, cardiovascular risk,&#xD;
      diabetes, heart failure, renal insufficiency, other co-morbidities, including the Charlson&#xD;
      Comorbidity Index (CCI), previous MI, medications, ejection fraction, and the classification&#xD;
      of MI. Cardiovascular risk will be assessed according to the Global Registry of Acute&#xD;
      Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score (GRS). Results from echocardiography, ECGs, laboratory&#xD;
      testing and registration of anthropometric data will be included according to routine&#xD;
      practice within the frame of SWEDEHEART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of cohorts of invasively or conservatively treated patients with different stages&#xD;
      of frailty will be done one, three, six, 12, 24 and 36 months after the inclusion point&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

      Background In Western countries the numbers of elderly patients are increasing. Although many&#xD;
      elderly individuals are healthy, the number of individuals with complex needs for health care&#xD;
      is large and growing. Patients less than 80 years of age, who suffer a myocardial infarction&#xD;
      are usually offered an early invasive strategy including coronary angiography possibly&#xD;
      followed by intervention, preferably percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Among non&#xD;
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients, 80 years of age or over, only&#xD;
      approximately 40% receive an invasive approach in Sweden, since the majority are handled in a&#xD;
      conservative way, i.e. with medical treatment only. Furthermore, as with pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment, there is a large variation between Swedish counties regarding the choice of&#xD;
      strategy for the treatment of elderly (80+) patients with NSTEMI with an even larger&#xD;
      variation between acute hospitals ranging from 20% to 90 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swedish national guidelines for heart disease have emphasized that the patient's&#xD;
      biological age, i.e. the patient's biological status and expected length of life, is crucial&#xD;
      for decision-making, though there is limited guidance regarding how the biological age should&#xD;
      be estimated.The term frailty denotes a multi-dimensional syndrome characterized by increased&#xD;
      vulnerability and decreased physiologic reserves, which can be seen as a marker of biological&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Canadian Study of Health and Ageing (CSHA) Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a global&#xD;
      clinical measure of biological age, mixing co-morbidity, disability and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      The CFS might be the most commonly used frailty instrument in an acute care context. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously reported the potential importance of frailty for short-term (1&#xD;
      month) and medium-term outcome (1 year) in a NSTEMI population. However, published data on&#xD;
      the role of frailty´s prognostic value, its capacity to predict adverse effects including&#xD;
      complications, and the potential to guide clinical decision-making for elderly patients with&#xD;
      myocardial infarction are scarce, particularly regarding longer-term outcomes.Similarly,&#xD;
      there is a lack of knowledge of how different patterns of comorbidity burden, e.g. measured&#xD;
      by a well-established index like the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) might influence&#xD;
      rational decision-making. Particularly this might be true regarding the combination of&#xD;
      frailty and comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The large variation in the management of these patients shows that there is need for further&#xD;
      studies within this area in order to determine which treatment one should chose, whether it&#xD;
      be invasive or conservative, in different groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims To explore the association between frailty and treatment patterns in cardiac care To&#xD;
      study the association between outcomes and degree of frailty, with and without comprehensive&#xD;
      adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how treatment benefits for patients admitted to coronary care units differ in&#xD;
      patients depending on comorbidities and frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that frailty is independently associated with worse&#xD;
      outcomes, including mortality, readmissions and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also hypothesize that frailty influences the benefit-risk ratio for&#xD;
      pharmacological therapies and invasive treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and material An observational, register based, multicentre study. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
      Patients consecutively included in the SWEDEHEART registry. Exclusion criteria: None.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWEDEHEART is a national quality registry collecting information on all patients hospitalized&#xD;
      with MI or suspected MI. All 72 Swedish hospitals with acute coronary care contribute with&#xD;
      data. Briefly, information is collected prospectively about individual patients' medical&#xD;
      history, treatment before admission, management during hospital stay, treatment at discharge,&#xD;
      and diagnoses. Approximately 20.000 patients diagnosed with MI are included in this register&#xD;
      per year. From January 1st 2020 frailty (CFS) is a mandatory variable in the registry.&#xD;
      However, as a pilot project to ensure feasibility, five hospitals began to register frailty&#xD;
      November 1st, 2017. These include three university hospitals: the Huddinge-Karolinska&#xD;
      Hospital, the Linköping University Hospital and the Sahlgrenska Hospital, and two large&#xD;
      county hospitals: The NAL-Uddevalla (NU) Hospital and Gavle Hospital. For the investigators&#xD;
      initial analyses data will be used from the pilot study to assess the association between CFS&#xD;
      level and outcomes. The data extraction will be done by one of the monitors of the SWEDEHEART&#xD;
      registry. After about two years the investigators will extract data prospectively entered&#xD;
      into the registry. By use of the Swedish unique personal identification numbers (PIN) data&#xD;
      from the SWEDEHAERT will be merged with data from the National cause of death registry in&#xD;
      order to obtain information on mortality and cause of death, with the National patient&#xD;
      registry, a comprehensive national register of the consumption of inpatient hospital care&#xD;
      maintained by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, to obtain information on&#xD;
      comorbidity and outcomes, with the Swedish prescribed drugs registry to obtain information on&#xD;
      collected drugs and from Statistics Sweden information on socio-economic factors and country&#xD;
      of birth. After data extraction, merging PINs will be removed and all statistical analyses&#xD;
      will be performed on de-identified data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frailty instrument The crucial study instrument CFS is a 9-point scale, derived from the&#xD;
      deficit of accumulation model of frailty, and it has been validated against the Frailty&#xD;
      Index. It has good predictive validity and prognostic power, is relying on clinical judgment,&#xD;
      and is relatively easily used in clinical practice, see the attached document Clinical&#xD;
      Frailty Scale. Since the scale includes several degrees it can be considered to be&#xD;
      particularly appropriate for risk stratification, and accordingly it has been used for this&#xD;
      purpose. The investigators have got the instrument owner´s permission to use this scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the patient's degree of frailty will be based on bedside judgment&#xD;
      undertaken preferably by registered nurses regarding frailty and other clinical information&#xD;
      including the records in the patient file. The inter-rater reliability among a sample of&#xD;
      frailty-assessing nurses will be pragmatically assessed before the study start, see&#xD;
      Statistics. During the study there will be several support functions in order to enhance the&#xD;
      validity and reliability of the judgments: a manual and an instruction film on the frailty&#xD;
      assessment via CFS has been developed by a focus group including cardiological and geriatric&#xD;
      expertise; there will be instructions on how to assess frailty on the homepage of SWEDEHEART;&#xD;
      and five trained SWEDEHEART nurses will function as monitors and support for the local&#xD;
      assessing nurses, as will the mentioned expert group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRF focus on demographic and clinical patient characteristics registered in the&#xD;
      SWEDEHEART, particularly those which are supposed to be potential confounders when testing&#xD;
      the hypothesis: chronological age, gender, cardiovascular risk, diabetes, heart failure,&#xD;
      renal insufficiency, other co-morbidities, including the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI),&#xD;
      previous MI, medications, ejection fraction, and the classification of MI. Cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk will be assessed according to the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk&#xD;
      score (GRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from echocardiography, ECGs, laboratory testing and registration of anthropometric&#xD;
      data will be included according to routine practice within the frame of SWEDEHEART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of cohorts of invasively or conservatively treated patients with different stages&#xD;
      of frailty will be done one, three, six, 12, 24 and 36 months after the inclusion point&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
