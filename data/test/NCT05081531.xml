  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current clinical management algorithms for squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC)&#xD;
      involve the use of surgery and / or radiotherapy (RT) depending on the stage of the disease&#xD;
      at diagnosis. Radical RT, exclusive or in combination with systemic therapy, represents an&#xD;
      effective therapeutic option according to the international guidelines. Despite the recent&#xD;
      technological advancements in the field of RT, about 30-50% of patients will develop&#xD;
      locoregional failure after primary treatment . Moreover, although the development of&#xD;
      Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)&#xD;
      techniques allowed a greater sparing of dose on healthy tissues, radiation-induced toxicity&#xD;
      still represents a relevant concern, impacting on quality of life. The continuous effort of&#xD;
      personalized medicine has the goal of improving patient's outcome, in terms of both disease's&#xD;
      control and pattern of toxicity. Advanced imaging modalities appear to play an essential role&#xD;
      in the customization of the radiation treatment as shown through the use of Adaptive&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (ART) and radiomic. With ART we mean the adaptation of tumor volumes and&#xD;
      surrounding organs at risk (OARs) to the shrinkage and patient emaciation during RT&#xD;
      treatment. Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) includes techniques that allow knowledge of&#xD;
      patient-specific anatomical variations informed by Image-guided radiotherapies (IGRTs) to&#xD;
      feedback into the plan and dose-delivery optimization during the treatment course. Radiomic&#xD;
      is the extraction of quantitative features from medical images to characterize tumor&#xD;
      pathology or heterogeneity. Radiomic features extracted from medical images can be used as&#xD;
      input features to create a machine learning model able to predict survival, and to guide&#xD;
      treatment thanks to its predictive value in view of therapy personalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of both ART and radiomic analysis could potentially be considered a further&#xD;
      advance in the personalization of oncological treatments, and in particular for radiation&#xD;
      treatments. For this reason, the investigators designed the present research project with the&#xD;
      aim to prospectively evaluate a machine learning-based radiomic approach to predict outcome&#xD;
      and toxicity of HNSCC patients treated with ART by mean of CT, MRI and PET-scan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is characterized by an incidence in&#xD;
      Europe of 140.000 new cases per year, with survival rates at 5 years ranging from 25 to 65%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical management algorithms for HNSCC patients involve the use of surgery and / or&#xD;
      radiotherapy depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Radical radiotherapy (RT),&#xD;
      exclusive or in combination with systemic therapy, represents an effective therapeutic option&#xD;
      according to the international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the recent technological advancements in the field of radiation therapy, about 30-50%&#xD;
      of patients will develop locoregional failure after primary treatment of head and neck&#xD;
      cancer. Moreover, although the development of Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)&#xD;
      and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) techniques allowed a greater sparing of dose on&#xD;
      healthy tissues, radiation-induced toxicity still represents a relevant concern, impacting on&#xD;
      quality of life of cancer patients even for long time after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous effort of personalized medicine has the goal of improving patient's outcome,&#xD;
      in terms of both disease's control and pattern of toxicity. Advanced imaging modalities&#xD;
      appear to play an essential role in the customization of the radiation treatment as shown&#xD;
      through the use of Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART) and radiomic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With ART the investigators mean the adaptation of tumor volumes and surrounding organs at&#xD;
      risk (OARs) to the shrinkage and patient emaciation during RT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent literature showed that tumor shrinkage can reach 70% by the end of the RT&#xD;
      treatment, and at the same time OARs, such as parotid glands, can reduce their size by 7 to&#xD;
      70%. These alterations, if not taken into account, can lead to an unexpected delivery of&#xD;
      lower dose on the tumor and higher dose of OARs compared to what planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) includes techniques that allow knowledge of patient-specific&#xD;
      anatomical variations informed by Image-guided radiotherapies (IGRTs) to feedback into the&#xD;
      plan and dose-delivery optimization during the treatment course. The persisting weakest link&#xD;
      in the treatment chain for radiotherapy remains clinician-led target identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to CT or CBCT, MRI offers superior soft-tissue definition with no associated&#xD;
      radiation risk. MRI identifies targets larger than on CT because tumour that otherwise would&#xD;
      have been missed is now seenah; however, most commonly, targets are reported to be smaller&#xD;
      when delineated on MRI. The resulting smaller MRI-derived target improves the therapeutic&#xD;
      ratio so enabling dose escalation. The availability of 'functional' MRI sequences holds&#xD;
      promise that geometric adaptation maybe complemented by biological adaptation.&#xD;
      Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a functional imaging technique dependent on the random&#xD;
      motion of water molecules to generate image contrast. As tumours usually have greater&#xD;
      cellularity than normal tissue, they demonstrate higher signal intensity, i.e., restricted&#xD;
      diffusion on MRI. This is reflected in the low mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)&#xD;
      value. This has potential to provide both qualitative and quantitative information. Change in&#xD;
      the ADC has been used to identify early treatment response, and to predict local recurrence.&#xD;
      Therefore, on-board DWI could identify early non-responders who may benefit from change in&#xD;
      treatment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiomic is the extraction of quantitative features from medical images to characterize tumor&#xD;
      pathology or heterogeneity. Radiomic features extracted from medical images can be used as in&#xD;
      put features to create a machine learning model able to predict survival, and to guide&#xD;
      treatment thanks to its predictive value in view of therapy personalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously evaluated in a retrospective study the qualitative analysis of the radiomic&#xD;
      characteristics of head and neck tumor tissues, in order to identify a predictive signature&#xD;
      of the biological characteristics of the tumor. The investigators stratified HNSCC patients&#xD;
      according to the most significant radiomic features into high- and low-risk groups of relapse&#xD;
      and survival after radio-chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of both ART and radiomic analysis could potentially be considered a further&#xD;
      advance in the personalization of oncological treatments, and in particular for radiation&#xD;
      treatments. For this reason, the investigator designed the present research project with the&#xD;
      aim to prospectively evaluate a machine learning-based radiomic approach to predict outcome&#xD;
      and toxicity of HNSCC patients treated with ART by mean of CT, MRI and PET-scan.&#xD;
