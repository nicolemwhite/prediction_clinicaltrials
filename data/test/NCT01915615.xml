    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common monogenic heart disease and the most&#xD;
      frequent cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young. It is characterized by unexplained&#xD;
      left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diffuse and patchy fibrosis, and myofibrillar disarray.&#xD;
      While the majority of patients remain asymptomatic, prognosis is poor in a subset who present&#xD;
      with SCD or progress to heart failure (HF). Current methods to predict risk of these adverse&#xD;
      events and to target therapy are limited. Current medical therapy does not protect against&#xD;
      SCD, nor does it prevent development of HF. Therefore, the identification of novel risk&#xD;
      markers would help develop therapeutic targets aimed at altering the phenotypic expression to&#xD;
      impact the natural history, especially SCD and HF. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is&#xD;
      emerging as a powerful tool for diagnosis and risk stratification in HCM including assessment&#xD;
      of LV mass and pattern of hypertrophy. Late gadolinium enhancement by CMR is a marker of&#xD;
      focal myocardial fibrosis which is thought to underlie the arrhythmogenic substrate as well&#xD;
      as promote development of HF. The investigators hypothesize that HCM patients with a higher&#xD;
      primary outcome event rate can be identified by novel CMR findings. The majority of cases of&#xD;
      HCM are autosomal dominant and about 60% are caused by mutations in genes encoding cardiac&#xD;
      sarcomeric proteins. However, the relationship between genetic mutation, disease phenotype,&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes remains poorly understood. The investigators hypothesize that HCM&#xD;
      patients with sarcomeric HCM mutations will have a higher primary outcome event rate and more&#xD;
      marked myocardial pathology on CMR than those without. Furthermore, there may be a link&#xD;
      between sarcomeric mutations and fibrosis, as mutation carriers with overt HCM as well as&#xD;
      those without hypertrophy have elevated markers of collagen turnover. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore hypothesize that serum biomarkers of collagen metabolism in HCM will predict&#xD;
      outcomes. Thus, the Specific Aim is to develop a predictive model of cardiovascular outcomes&#xD;
      in HCM by: 1) using exploratory data mining methods to identify demographic, clinical, and&#xD;
      novel CMR, genetic and biomarker variables associated with the outcomes and 2) develop a&#xD;
      score from the predictive model that can be used to assess risk given a patient's combination&#xD;
      of risk factors, thus establishing the evidence base to enable clinical trial design to&#xD;
      reduce morbidity and mortality in HCM in a cost-effective manner.&#xD;

      2.2 Rationale Presently used risk predictors in HCM for the clinical outcomes of SCD and HF&#xD;
      are still insufficient and limit clinical trials and institution of novel therapies in this&#xD;
      disease. This large scale, prospective clinical registry will systematically answer the&#xD;
      important question whether, through addition of a combination of advanced CMR phenotyping,&#xD;
      genetic and biomarker analysis, risk stratification in HCM could be substantially improved&#xD;
      over presently used clinical risk predictors. Emerging novel blood, genetic, and CMR markers&#xD;
      offer the paradigm-shifting promise of reliably identifying those at risk. In addition, this&#xD;
      will be the largest genotyped population of HCM available to correlate with comprehensive CMR&#xD;
      and biomarker evaluation. This will allow unique opportunities to evaluate genotype-phenotype&#xD;
      correlations and compare specific genetic subsets in a manner that has not been possible in&#xD;
      the past. This study will also establish a predictive model that can be used to assess risk&#xD;
      given a patient's combination of risk factors. This will help to select patients for future&#xD;
      clinical trials to prevent SCD and HF. In addition, it will identify surrogate endpoints to&#xD;
      monitor treatment response in HCM. In this way, the evidence base will be established in HCM&#xD;
      to enable clinical trial design to reduce morbidity and mortality in HCM in a cost-effective&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 OBJECTIVES The Specific Aim of this study is to develop a predictive model of&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by: 1) using exploratory data mining&#xD;
      methods to identify demographic, clinical, and novel CMR, genetic and biomarker variables&#xD;
      associated with the outcomes and 2) develop a score from the predictive model that can be&#xD;
      used to assess risk given a patient's combination of risk factors, thus establishing the&#xD;
      evidence base to enable clinical trial design to reduce morbidity and mortality in HCM in a&#xD;
      cost-effective manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the relationship between these novel risk markers in HCM and clinical outcome,&#xD;
      the investigators propose a natural history study of 2750 patients with clinically diagnosed&#xD;
      HCM studied at baseline with collection of demographic data, clinical risk factors, as well&#xD;
      as novel markers from CMR, genotyping, and serum biomarkers of collagen turnover and&#xD;
      myocardial injury, enrolled over a 2-year period and followed for 3-5 years (mean of 4&#xD;
      years). The study will be powered to identify risk markers in a Cox model (imaging, serum,&#xD;
      and genetic beyond standard clinical risk factors) with a hazard ratio of 1.5 or greater for&#xD;
      the primary endpoint, which will be cardiac death (including SCD and HF death), aborted SCD&#xD;
      (appropriate discharge of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), and need for heart&#xD;
      transplantation. Secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, ventricular&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmias, hospitalization for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. This&#xD;
      study will enable establishment of a predictive model that will help to identify patients at&#xD;
      risk as well as patients for future clinical trials to prevent SCD and HF. In addition, it&#xD;
      will identify surrogate endpoints to monitor treatment response in HCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 STUDY DESIGN 4.1 Selection of the Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2750 patients will be recruited and will include at least 51% females and 30% minorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient or outpatient setting from 35-40 sites in North America and Europe&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Biomarker and DNA Samples Blood will be collected by peripheral venipuncture at&#xD;
      enrollment as a source of serum and plasma for biomarker analysis, as well as a source of DNA&#xD;
      for genetic testing. Fasting samples are requested but if this is not possible logistically,&#xD;
      non-fasting samples can be acquired and noted as such. The investigators will also ask&#xD;
      subjects to refrain from strenuous exercise for 24 hours prior to blood draw to decrease the&#xD;
      potential for spuriously elevated biomarkers that reflect the influence of vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cardiac MRI will be performed and will take approximately one hour. 0.15mM of gadolinium&#xD;
      contrast will be infused through an intravenous line during the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full details of the protocol will be in the Study Manual. Laboratory Evaluations 5.1.1&#xD;
      Specimen Collection, Preparation, Handling and Shipping Biomarker samples (Full details are&#xD;
      provided in the separate Biomarkers Technical Manual) 1. Collect 3, 10 ml tubes each of serum&#xD;
      and K3 EDTA plasma in the fasting state (or indicated non-fasting if fasting samples cannot&#xD;
      be obtained) DNA samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Collect one 10ml EDTA tube. 6 STUDY SCHEDULE 6.1 Screening Patient's medical records will&#xD;
      be reviewed to be certain of diagnosis and eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent must be obtained by a member of the study team. 6.2 Baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial visit will be scheduled for study procedures as listed in #5 above. 6.3 Follow-up&#xD;
      Visits Yearly telephone follow-up will be obtained for up to 5 years and review of applicable&#xD;
      hospital or death records. Health status will be assessed with the SF-12 at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1 Study Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this prospective study is the composite of cardiac death (SCD and HF&#xD;
      death), aborted SCD including appropriate ICD firing, and need for heart transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, ventricular tachyarrhythmias,&#xD;
      hospitalization for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Sample Size Considerations Assuming a 3-year event rate of 4.2% based on recently&#xD;
      published literature10;11;26;27 and alpha error rate of 5%, 2500 patients provides over 90%&#xD;
      power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.5 for at least one risk factor in the Cox model. An&#xD;
      additional 250 (2750 total) patients will be enrolled to compensate for a projected dropout&#xD;
      rate of 2% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.3 Participant Enrollment and Follow-Up 2750 enrollees, will be followed up to 5 years.&#xD;
      10.4 Analysis Plan Because the anticipated event rate is small (4-5%), and the number of&#xD;
      potential predictive risk factors is large (20+), an exploratory, tree classification&#xD;
      analysis will be used to identify the strongest predictors and eliminate any that are judged&#xD;
      to have little or no predictive power. Based on the risk factors identified in the&#xD;
      exploratory analysis, a regression prediction model will be developed from which a summary&#xD;
      risk score for HCM can be calculated and easily used in clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tree-based data mining methods will be used to identify key variables in the prediction of&#xD;
      the primary outcome, a composite of cardiac death (SCD and HF death), aborted SCD including&#xD;
      appropriate ICD firing, and need for heart transplantation. Secondary endpoints will include&#xD;
      all-cause mortality, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, septal myectomy or alcohol ablation,&#xD;
      hospitalization for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Tree-based modeling is an&#xD;
      exploratory technique for uncovering structure in multivariate data28;29. It is particularly&#xD;
      useful for deriving prediction rules from a large number of screening variables or risk&#xD;
      factors. Tree models can be used for both classification (binary outcome) and regression&#xD;
      (continuous outcome). In either case, the collection of prediction rules (from the predictor&#xD;
      variables) is displayed in the form of a tree. The terminology mimics that of trees: the root&#xD;
      is the top node of the tree that displays the mean (regression) or proportion&#xD;
      (classification) of the outcome for the entire sample. A split is the rule for creating new&#xD;
      branches, and a leaf is a terminal node. Each node is a binary split of the predictor&#xD;
      variable that contains two sub-groups of the sample with the largest possible difference&#xD;
      between the groups. The same variable can appear in more than one level of the tree&#xD;
      (recursive partitioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of tree-based models over linear and additive models is that they are more&#xD;
      adept at capturing non-additive relationships and more easily uncover complex interactions&#xD;
      between predictor variables. Continuous variables or categorical variables with more than two&#xD;
      levels need not be dichotomized prior to the analysis - the tree algorithm determines the&#xD;
      cutoff value that produces the most homogenous nodes. Missing data can be treated as a&#xD;
      separate category. Initial tree models will include risk factors listed in the following&#xD;
      table as well as demographic variables, age, sex, and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical CMR Genetic Biomarkers Family history of HCM-related SCD LV ejection fraction MYH7&#xD;
      NT-pro BNP Unexplained recent syncope LV mass/mass index MYBPC3 Singulex cardiac troponin&#xD;
      Massive LVH (wall thickness &gt;30mm) Maximum diastolic wall thickness Thin filament mutations&#xD;
      PICP Multiiple burst of nonsustained VT LGE extent (% of LV mass) Compound/double&#xD;
      heterozygotes ST2 Hypotensive BP response to exercise Global extracellular volume fraction&#xD;
      Sarcomere mutation negative The initial tree is reduced in size (pruned) by comparing&#xD;
      misclassification error rates of smaller trees to larger trees to assess the reduction of the&#xD;
      predictive ability of trees resulting from the pruning process. The goal is to identify the&#xD;
      strongest predictors of HCM, any interactions of the predictors, and eliminate any factors&#xD;
      that have little predictive power. While tree models give rapid identification of the&#xD;
      strongest predictors and combinations of predictors, they do not usually result in clinically&#xD;
      useful prediction models that generalize well to patients in other settings. Regression&#xD;
      methods, using test-validation re-sampling procedures, will be used to develop the most valid&#xD;
      model possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the demographic, clinical, imaging, biomarker and genetic measures, plus any&#xD;
      interactions, identified in the tree analysis, Cox proportional hazards regression will be&#xD;
      used to develop a predictive model from which a summary risk score can be calculated and&#xD;
      applied in clinical settings. Parametric regression methods may be used if the proportional&#xD;
      hazards assumption is not met. The regression model will be developed using a 100-fold&#xD;
      validation procedure whereby 50% of the observations will be randomly selected for model&#xD;
      development (test sample) and the remaining 50% used to assess the model's predictive ability&#xD;
      (validation sample). This procedure will be repeated 100 times with a different random&#xD;
      selection of test-validation samples for each iteration. The c-index will be calculated to&#xD;
      assess model discrimination for both test and validation samples30. The ensemble of&#xD;
      test-validation models provides an estimate of the attenuation of the c-index when the model&#xD;
      is applied to a different sample as well as consistency of specific risk factors appearing in&#xD;
      the models. A final model will be constructed that includes the combination of the strongest&#xD;
      (high c-index and frequency of appearance) predictors. This model will then be applied to the&#xD;
      entire sample to estimate regression coefficients and hazard ratios and calculate a summary&#xD;
      risk score30. Nomograms will be constructed from the final model to provide predicted&#xD;
      probabilities of the risk scores. To increase the ease of use of a nomogram, variables which&#xD;
      are statistically significant but have little effect on prediction may be excluded. The model&#xD;
      will also be used to develop a prediction algorithm that rapidly calculates risk on a&#xD;
      hand-held electronic device. This analysis may also inform the design of clinical trials to&#xD;
      evaluate therapeutic efficacy by providing effect sizes (hazard ratios) to calculate sample&#xD;
      size requirements.&#xD;
