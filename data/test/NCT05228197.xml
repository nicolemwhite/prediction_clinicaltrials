    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether the Galen Prostate AI system has sufficient&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy and health economic value to be used for triage of pathology slides&#xD;
      within the NHS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, about 80-100,000 men every year undergo prostate biopsy to diagnose prostate&#xD;
      cancer. This equates to approximately 4 million histology slides; this is estimated to&#xD;
      increase to 160,000-200,000 men and up to 6 million slides by 2030 due to rising numbers of&#xD;
      men being tested for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Education England and the Royal College of Pathology point to a significant pathology&#xD;
      work-force shortage with only 3% of departments having adequate staffing levels and a 10%&#xD;
      vacancy rate filled by locums costing Â£26M every year. By 2021, there will be a 3% decrease&#xD;
      of the pathology consultant workforce (40 full-time pathologists); a period of time in which&#xD;
      other specialties are expected to see a 13% increase. However, to meet the rising numbers of&#xD;
      referrals to pathology departments, it is projected that there will need to be a 3-5% annual&#xD;
      growth in the number of pathologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-observer variability can occur between pathologists in terms of reporting a diagnosis&#xD;
      of clinically important and clinically unimportant prostate cancer by as much as 20% although&#xD;
      the differences are smaller when highly expert uro-pathologists are compared. This can lead&#xD;
      to inappropriate management of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Galen Prostate AI is a CE-marked deep learning AI-algorithm for prostate needle biopsies that&#xD;
      can identify cell types, tissue structures and morphological features for cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
      The technology is based on multi-layered convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for&#xD;
      image classification in which whole-slide imaging is analysed for the detection of tissue&#xD;
      areas and then benign versus cancer versus other pathology classification. Compared to almost&#xD;
      all competitors, Galen Prostate AI has been tested in ~10 times more tissue samples. Further,&#xD;
      Galen Prostate AI is the only algorithm that extends beyond cancer detection/grading to other&#xD;
      clinically relevant features (e.g., perineural invasion, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial&#xD;
      neoplasia [PIN], inflammation). To our knowledge, it is the only AI-algorithm in routine&#xD;
      clinical deployment - demonstrating technical feasibility and with proven clinical utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will perform validation in the NHS, for the first time. It is important to&#xD;
      stress that this type of algorithm has never been tested on a UK-based population, and in&#xD;
      particular, a population that includes a cohort of MRI targeted biopsies, which is now the&#xD;
      new diagnostic strategy as it detects clinically relevant prostate cancer in higher&#xD;
      percentages than the routine systematic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is the first and only to address the performance of the AI-based prostate algorithm&#xD;
      that extends beyond cancer detection and Gleason grading, by measuring amount of cancer and&#xD;
      detecting clinically meaningful features such as perineural invasion in addition to multiple&#xD;
      benign structures (e.g. HGPIN, atrophy, inflammation). Given the clinical relevance for such&#xD;
      features in the diagnosis process, a study addressing their validation and performance is not&#xD;
      only novel, but critical for implementation in routine clinical use.&#xD;
