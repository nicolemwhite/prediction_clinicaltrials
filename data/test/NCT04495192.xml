  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe Acquired Brain Injury is defined as a traumatic, post-anoxic, vascular or other brain&#xD;
      damage that causes coma for at least 24 hours and leads to permanent disability with&#xD;
      sensorial, motor, cognitive or compartmental impairment. In this context, an accurate&#xD;
      characterization of individual patients' profile in terms of neuronal damage, potential for&#xD;
      neuroplasticity, neurofunctional and clinical state could allow to plan tailored&#xD;
      rehabilitation and care pathway on the basis of solid prognostic information, also for&#xD;
      optimizing resources of the National Health care systems and enhance ethical decisions.&#xD;
      Patient profiling should encompass measures and procedures easily available at the bedside,&#xD;
      and with affordable time, resource, and money-costs to determine a real impact on National&#xD;
      Health systems. The aim of the study is identifying patient profiles in terms of clinical,&#xD;
      neurophysiological and genetical aspects with better long-term outcome in order to plan&#xD;
      tailored therapeutic interventions.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a severe Acquired Brain Injury (sABI) the consciousness, the functional and the&#xD;
      cognitive recovery of the patients depends on the severity of the damage suffered but also on&#xD;
      the vulnerability of the individual brain. Some patients with sABI may survive in a state of&#xD;
      Disorder of Consciousness (DoC) condition (i.e., patients in vegetative state/unresponsive&#xD;
      wakefulness syndrome, VS/UWS or in minimally conscious state, MCS). Other patients, despite&#xD;
      having a complete recovery of consciousness, can reach very variable degrees of functional&#xD;
      and cognitive autonomy. The prognostic factors of consciousness recovery of patients with&#xD;
      DoCs have been thoroughly investigated. Most of these studies investigated the acute phase,&#xD;
      while only a few studies have examined the role of early clinical factors emerging before the&#xD;
      complete recovery of consciousness . Further prognostic insights can be provided by analysis&#xD;
      of genes coding for Apolipoprotein E (APOE), dopamineD2 receptor (DRD2), and Brain Derived&#xD;
      Neutrophic Factors (BDNF), and by markers of axonal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project aims at identifying patient profiles with better long-term outcome in&#xD;
      order to plan tailored therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient profiles will be drawn up by gathering patient's demographic (age, gender, social&#xD;
      and educational level), anamnestic (aetiology and time post-brain injury, Cognitive Reserve&#xD;
      Index), clinical state (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), CRS-R total score and&#xD;
      corresponding consciousness state; Disability Rating Scale, DRS, Functional Oral Intake&#xD;
      Scale; FOIS, Glasgow Outcome Scale Expanded; GOS-E, Level of Cognitive Functioning; LCF) and&#xD;
      neurophysiological data (Electroencephalogram (EEG), Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP),&#xD;
      and Motor evoked potentials (MEP) nerve conduction aimed at evaluating occurrence of critical&#xD;
      illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM)) at study entry (baseline), together with neural&#xD;
      biomarkers (genetic markers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the above mentioned stratification of patients by this multimodal approach,&#xD;
      the present study aimed to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the possible association of certain profiles with the consciousness recovery&#xD;
           at the time of discharge from the Intensive Rehabilitation Unit (IRU), at 1 year and 2&#xD;
           years from the acute event&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the possible association of certain profiles with the functional outcomes at&#xD;
           the time of discharge from the Intensive Rehabilitation Unit (IRU), at 1 year and 2&#xD;
           years from the acute event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate the possible association of certain profiles with the long-term cognitive&#xD;
           profile and the level of familiar and social participation at 1 year and 2 years from&#xD;
           the acute event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting , population and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a longitudinal multi-location prospective observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four centers of the Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation will participate (Florence, La Spezia, Milan&#xD;
      and Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi and the neurogenetics laboratory of the University of Florence,&#xD;
      Department of Medical and Experimental Sciences, Neurology). The enrollment phase will last 3&#xD;
      years (June 2020-June 2023). 520 patients with severe brain injury will be included (200 for&#xD;
      the Florence and La Spezia units and 60 for the Milan and Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi units).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted in the participant IRU with a history of sABI within 4 months, aged&#xD;
      18+, presenting a signed informed consent signature for the participation to the study and&#xD;
      for the genetic analysis will be consecutively enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multidimodal evaluation including clinical examinations and neurophysiological assessments&#xD;
      will be performed by skilled professionals. The study foresees four steps in the late acute&#xD;
      phase and two in the long-term phase: 1) at the study entry time (T0), 2) at three months&#xD;
      from T0 (T1) 3) at 6 months from T0 (T2) 4) at discharge (T3) 5) at 12 months from the acute&#xD;
      event (T4) 6) at 24 months from the acute event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment including :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consciousness assessment using CRS-R&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Care severity profile: including the comorbidity assessed thought the Cumulative Illness&#xD;
           Rating Scale (CIRS), the presence of medical devices, sepsis occurrence during the IRU&#xD;
           stay, neurosurgery interventions, bedsores, epileptic event and other complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Functional evaluation using the following scales: ERBI, GOS-E, DRS, FIM, PAINED pain&#xD;
           scale, TCT, Ashworth, FOIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neurocognitive profile evaluation using the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test&#xD;
           (GOAT), the Level of Cognitive Functioning (LCF) and the International Classification of&#xD;
           Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), ABS, AES and Cognitive Reserve Index (CRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal neurophysiological evaluation including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard EEG recording at rest. EEG background activity and reactivity will be&#xD;
           classified according to recently proposed diagnostic criteria for DoC and to American&#xD;
           Clinical Neurophysiology Society Critical Care EEG Terminology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies. Sensory nerve action potentials, and&#xD;
           compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) will be evaluated. Muscular activity at rest&#xD;
           and when possible during reflex contraction will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PEM: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be performed according to the standard&#xD;
           criteria of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. MEP will be&#xD;
           recorded from abductor digiti minimi and tibialis anterior muscles and size of MEP&#xD;
           measured as MEP/CMAP amplitude ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Bilateral upper limb SEP will be recorded according to the International Federation of&#xD;
           Clinical Neurophysiology. The presence or absence of N20/P25 cortical components will be&#xD;
           evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic assessment Genomic DNA will be obtained from EDTA-whole venous blood sample by&#xD;
      Automated Systems QiaCube (Qiagen). The genetic analysis of 5 different single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms on ApoE, BDNF and DRD2 genes will be performed by high resolution melt (HRM)&#xD;
      analyses and direct sequencing on Automatic Genetic Analyzer. APOE genotypes will be&#xD;
      investigated by HRM with two sets of PCR primers designed to amplify the regions encompassing&#xD;
      rs7412 [NC_000019.9: g.45412079C&gt;T] and rs429358 (NC_000019.9: g.45411941T&gt;C). The samples&#xD;
      with known ApoE genotypes, which had been validated by DNA sequencing, will be used as&#xD;
      standard references. The genetic polymorphism data will be compared to sex- and age-matched&#xD;
      control of the DNA banking of the neurogenetic Laboratory of Careggi Hospital of Florence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All collected data will be analyzed using a machine learning algorithm, creating, for each&#xD;
      patient, a risk profile for the possible consciousness recovery and functional autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the results of this study, partecipant will build on a &quot;decision support&#xD;
      tool&quot; for future sABI patients afferent to the Intensive Rehabilitative Unit, in order to&#xD;
      plan personalized rehabilitative and therapeutic interventions, allowing therefore an&#xD;
      optimization of resources (costs and resources) for National Health Service&#xD;
