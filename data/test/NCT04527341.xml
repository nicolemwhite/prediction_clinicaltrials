  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative Delirium (POD) is a common complication in patients after cardiac surgery,&#xD;
      which is associated with short-term prognosis and long-term quality of life. Due to the lack&#xD;
      of specific treatment, prevention is the most effective strategy to reduce delirium. Risk&#xD;
      assessment greatly contributes to guide prevention by stratifying the risk of the POD.&#xD;
      However, the high-quality risk assessment tools are still sparse, and the combination of risk&#xD;
      assessment and stratified prevention has not been applied to the management of delirium after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. In the previous work, we found the predictive value of preoperative cardiac&#xD;
      function on POD, and found a critical value. On the basis of previous research, this project&#xD;
      will learn from previous studies on risk factors of POD, and deeply explore potential&#xD;
      predictors. Furthermore, we will develop and validate POD risk prediction model, and then&#xD;
      develop it into a visual evaluation system. In addition, based on the theory of risk&#xD;
      management and risk assessment tools, using the concepts and methods of evidence-based&#xD;
      medicine, the risk assessment system and stratified management program of POD will be formed&#xD;
      and evaluated by expert discussion meetings. It is expected that the risk assessment system&#xD;
      and stratified management program constructed by this project could simply and quickly screen&#xD;
      high-risk patients and carry out timely intervention, so as to reduce the incidence of POD,&#xD;
      improve patients' prognosis and the quality of life after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
