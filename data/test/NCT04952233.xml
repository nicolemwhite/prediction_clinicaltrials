    <textblock>
      Compared with the personal experience judgment of physicians, deep learning can identify&#xD;
      something more quickly, efficiently, and accurately The identification and diagnosis of&#xD;
      diseases save the energy of clinical and imaging doctors and achieve an individualized&#xD;
      diagnosis of patients Diagnosis and evaluation are beneficial to the formulation of clinical&#xD;
      surgical methods and the improvement of patients' prognoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses deep learning technology, through the big data of cervical spondylosis cases&#xD;
      learn, to explore the use of deep learning The feasibility of identifying and analyzing the&#xD;
      characteristic imaging findings of cervical CT images that may be suggestive of a diagnosis&#xD;
      It is attempted to reach the level of artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis of cervical&#xD;
      spondylosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical spondylosis is due to cervical discs and intervertebral joints and their secondary&#xD;
      changes to the adjacent spinal cord, nerve roots, and vertebrae Artery and other tissue&#xD;
      structure, causing the corresponding clinical symptoms. Cervical spondylosis is a common and&#xD;
      frequent disease among middle-aged and elderly people. The incidence of cervical spondylosis&#xD;
      is 10 percent in people over 30 years of age and is higher among those who work at a desk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two kinds of cervical spondylosis are common: cervical spondylotic radiculopathy and cervical&#xD;
      spondylotic myelopathy. The principles of treatment differ greatly, and the prognosis after&#xD;
      treatment is also different. Precise preoperative imaging and clinical diagnosis are helpful&#xD;
      to accurately estimate the effect of surgery and the prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, to achieve early accurate diagnosis is to improve the cervical spine Key to the&#xD;
      curative effect of the disease. Generally referred to as deep learning is a kind of pattern&#xD;
      analysis method, through the combination of simple and nonlinear module for multi-level&#xD;
      &quot;character learning&quot; or &quot;said learning&quot; model of each module to each layer (original input)&#xD;
      data into a higher dimension, more abstract representation, when there are enough of these&#xD;
      transformations, The initial &quot;low level&quot; feature representation can be transformed into &quot;high&#xD;
      level&quot; feature representation, and complex learning tasks such as classification can be&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the classification task, the features that are important to the classification are&#xD;
      amplified by increasing the number of layers, and the irrelevant features are ignored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the main research methods include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),&#xD;
      self-coding Neural Networks based on multi-layer neurons, and deep confidence Networks. At&#xD;
      present, CNN is mainly used in the field of medical image recognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such as AlexNet, Densenet, VGG16, Googlenet and so on. The motivation for deep learning is to&#xD;
      build neural networks that mimic the human brain for analytical learning. It imitates the&#xD;
      mechanisms of the human brain to interpret data, such as images, sounds, and text and has&#xD;
      made significant progress in solving many problems that are difficult for traditional machine&#xD;
      learning to solve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep learning methods have proven to be very good at discovering complex structures in&#xD;
      high-dimensional data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of medical and health care, artificial intelligence technology has gradually&#xD;
      solved the problem of data interpretation of various medical images, discovered more&#xD;
      information &quot;hidden&quot; behind the images, such as X-ray, CT, MRI, etc., and will gradually&#xD;
      realize the recognition, screening, and diagnosis of a specific case, reaching the expert&#xD;
      level of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, the application of artificial intelligence technology can reduce the load&#xD;
      of doctors, reduce medical misdiagnosis, and improve the efficiency of diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, deep learning has been widely used in the diagnosis and prediction of various&#xD;
      diseases in various systems of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemke et al. conducted machine learning research after manual segmentation of pelvic CT&#xD;
      images and found that the deep learning model can be used to automatically recognize and&#xD;
      segment a variety of different types of tissues in the pelvic cavity, including muscle, bone,&#xD;
      fat, subcutaneous adipose tissue, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Koichiro Yasaka et al. [8] conducted a deep learning study on the lumbar spine and found that&#xD;
      deep learning can be used to predict the bone density of the lumbar spine and further&#xD;
      evaluate the severity of osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spampinato et al. conducted a deep learning study on hand X-rays to predict bone age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is of great significance to apply deep learning, an emerging analytical&#xD;
      technique, to the recognition of imaging features of cervical CT images. The research&#xD;
      significance is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate and efficient preoperative diagnosis of cervical spondylosis can be realized to&#xD;
      avoid excessive medical treatment or disease delay caused by missed diagnosis and&#xD;
      misdiagnosis. Individualized diagnosis and evaluation can be achieved for patients, which&#xD;
      helps clinically to reasonably specify treatment strategies, and is conducive to the&#xD;
      formulation of clinical surgical methods and the improvement of patient prognosis.&#xD;
