  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, phase II non-randomised controlled clinical study. Dose escalation&#xD;
      will be implemented using 1.8 Gy increments from baseline 75.6 Gy. Patients' RT prescription&#xD;
      may be escalated up to max 81 Gy once dose volume constraints are adhered to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated using the participating institution's standard rectal&#xD;
      preparation protocol, bladder-filling protocol and appropriate immobilisation device(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone beam CT on-treatment imaging is recommended for this study. However, the use of&#xD;
      individual institutional imaging equipment and techniques is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute GU/GI toxicities will be assessed weekly during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GU/GI toxicities will also be assessed 2 months post RT, 8 months post RT and 6 monthly&#xD;
      thereafter to year nine and in line with the participating institution's standard routine&#xD;
      follow-up (FU) thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational sub-studies (optional), only apply to patients who are consented prior to&#xD;
      commencement of hormone therapy at centres participating in the translational sub-study.&#xD;
      Patients at centres participating in the translational sub-studies will be given the option&#xD;
      of participating in sub-study 1 (Proteomic Analysis), sub-study 2 (Raman spectroscopic&#xD;
      analysis), or both (sample collection will not be mandatory).&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if dose escalated IMRT for high risk localised prostate cancer can provide PSA&#xD;
      relapse free survival similar to that reported by Memorial Sloan Kettering (Alicikus et al&#xD;
      2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Study 1 (Proteomic Analysis):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use proteomic analysis of sequential blood and urine samples to detect changes in profiles&#xD;
      that may predict outcome and identify prognostic biochemical markers of early disease&#xD;
      progression and/ or toxicity. The unique molecular signatures may also allow the&#xD;
      identification of targets for therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To undertake, where possible, other biochemical analyses including mRNA, miRNA and metabolite&#xD;
      profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Study 2 (Raman spectroscopic analysis):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate a new approach to prediction of radiation response, based on biochemical&#xD;
      fingerprinting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival and disease-free survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the significance of published prognostic/ stratification factors such as the&#xD;
           UCSF-CAPRA score and assess their application to the data from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To achieve the maximum dose escalation (up to 81Gy). This will be assessed as the&#xD;
           percentage of patients that receive each dose level for all categories (dose increments&#xD;
           of 1.8 Gy from 75.6 Gy up to max 81 Gy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence and severity of acute and late GU, GI and erectile dysfunction toxicities&#xD;
           will be described, and correlated with DVH parameters.&#xD;

    <description>Raman spectra will be recorded from both lymphocytes and sera to produce a library of spectral measurements in patients pre- and post-treatment. Established methodologies for the assessment of the patient radiosensitivity (G2 assay, DNA damage assays and gene expression profiling), will be used in parallel with advanced multivariate and machine learning methodologies to develop a platform for prediction of such endpoints using Raman spectra of the cellular and plasma fraction of the patient blood.</description>
