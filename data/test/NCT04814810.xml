  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection of ongoing hemorrhage (OH) before onset of hemorrhagic shock is a universally&#xD;
      acknowledged great unmet need, and particularly important after traumatic injury. Delays in&#xD;
      the detection of OH are associated with a &quot;failure to rescue&quot; and a dramatic deterioration in&#xD;
      prognosis once the onset of clinically frank shock has occurred. An early alert to the&#xD;
      presence of OH would save countless lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single site study, enrolling 48 patients undergoing liver resection in a &quot;no&#xD;
      significant risk&quot; prospective clinical trial to: 1) further identify a minimal subset of&#xD;
      noninvasive measurement technologies necessary for the desired diagnostic performance, 2)&#xD;
      validate the performance of our Phase I algorithm, and 3) re-train the algorithm to a Phase&#xD;
      II human iteration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome variables are non-invasive measurements that will be used for machine&#xD;
      learning, not real-time patient management. The data generated will be used later for&#xD;
      discovery and validation in traditional and innovative machine learning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhagic shock remains a leading cause of death on the battlefield as well in civilian&#xD;
      communities. Early detection of ongoing hemorrhage before progression to frank shock would&#xD;
      allow early intervention. It is widely appreciated that the classic medical vital signs&#xD;
      perform poorly until late in the progression to shock after traumatic injury. Currently&#xD;
      available techniques, including intermittent vital sign monitoring, laboratory analysis, and&#xD;
      single measurement devices have poor performance before clinically obvious physiologic&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to develop a multi-technology noninvasive system for&#xD;
      early detection of ongoing hemorrhage. The underlying hypothesis is that deep learning&#xD;
      developed algorithms obtaining diagnostic signals from multiple sources will outperform&#xD;
      single technology solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the promise of innovative noninvasive testing has received wide attention, development&#xD;
      of effective bedside technologies has thus far been limited and their performance&#xD;
      disappointing. In 2014, Kim et al stated that &quot;The results from this meta-analysis found that&#xD;
      inaccuracy and imprecision of continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring devices are&#xD;
      larger than what was defined as acceptable&quot; and noninvasive blood pressure measurement is&#xD;
      among the most fully developed of these technologies. The failure of noninvasive technologies&#xD;
      in the detection or diagnosis of complex disease states has been essentially complete. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that this failure reflects the limitations of uniplex systems (a single&#xD;
      sensor in a single-location) and patient-to-patient variation in physiologic response.&#xD;
      Uniplex systems sacrifice the entire diagnostic signal in anatomic-temporal patterns, which&#xD;
      likely has significant discriminant power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, technological innovation in early detection of ongoing hemorrhage has been of two&#xD;
      broad categories: 1) a search to discover a single new measurement of tissue or organ status&#xD;
      or 2) application of more sophisticated mathematical techniques based on machine learning and&#xD;
      signal processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to develop a system that combines state-of-the-art noninvasive&#xD;
      sensing technologies and advanced multivariable statistical algorithms. This system will be&#xD;
      developed from its inception to be inexpensive and easily applied, even in austere settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid the unnecessary use of blood products, hepatectomies are performed with low central&#xD;
      venous pressure (CVP). This is accomplished through restrictive use of intravenous fluids and&#xD;
      at times medications to lower the central venous pressure. Low central venous pressure during&#xD;
      hepatectomy is an excellent model for development of technologies such as ours and has not&#xD;
      been previously used for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each procedure, the investigators will obtain a full ensemble of noninvasive optical,&#xD;
      electromagnetic and impedance physiological signals during the LCVPLR procedure. The work&#xD;
      proposed herein will evaluate these technologies during standard low central venous pressure&#xD;
      liver resections (LCVPLR). These data will be utilized for further machine learning-based&#xD;
      algorithm development. The proposed study will be low risk since the measured data will not&#xD;
      be available to the clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the performance of existing non-invasive sensing technologies and multivariable&#xD;
           algorithms in LCVPLR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain human model training and validation data sets during LCVPLR for further&#xD;
           refinement of the algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and Sample Size: The investigators anticipate acquiring data from every enrolled&#xD;
      subject. The data obtained before onset of parenchymal transection will be utilized as the&#xD;
      &quot;no hemorrhage&quot; control. Power and sample size calculations indicate that a sample size of 48&#xD;
      subjects should be sufficient to: 1) further identify the minimal subset of noninvasive&#xD;
      measurement technologies necessary for the desired diagnostic performance, 2) validate the&#xD;
      existing algorithms, and 3) initially train a human clinical iteration of the algorithms,&#xD;
      with a sufficient degree of accuracy (p &lt; 0.05 for ROC-AUC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a minimal risk study, there will be no change from standard of care for patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery. The surgical procedures and pharmacotherapies will proceed as per&#xD;
      standard clinical management. Enrolled patients will undergo standard preoperative,&#xD;
      anesthetic, and postoperative physiological monitoring.&#xD;
