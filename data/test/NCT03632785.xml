    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of coronary events occur in previously asymptomatic patients. Thus, the&#xD;
      early detection of the individuals at higher risk became an important research target within&#xD;
      the current cardiology. The various clinical scores used present a predictive accuracy for&#xD;
      ischemic events, evaluated by the ROC curve, which ranges from 0.73 to 0, 79. Therefore, the&#xD;
      introduction of new non-invasive techniques for the detection of atherosclerosis aims to&#xD;
      allow a more adequate classification of risk. The development of radiological techniques,&#xD;
      fundamentally coronary angiotomography of multiple detectors (CAMD) and electron beam&#xD;
      computed tomography-EBCT‖, demonstrated that the degree of coronary calcification correlates&#xD;
      with endothelial lesion and individual prognosis in the long term. Notably, the calcium score&#xD;
      has a weak correlation with the severity of coronary stenosis per se, possibly due to&#xD;
      variations in arterial remodeling due to coronary calcification. On the other hand, the CAMD&#xD;
      allows the detection of a small magnitude atheromatous disease, not diagnosed clinically, nor&#xD;
      by tests provoking ischemia, or even by coronary catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical relevance of the small magnitude atheromatous disease diagnosed by the ACMD and&#xD;
      its correlation with plaque vulnerability markers, mainly platelet aggregation, vascular&#xD;
      reactivity, and inflammation are still not well determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a case and control study and we will enrolled 90 patients with low and medium risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular event whose cases should present discrete plaques in the CAMD e controls&#xD;
      should present none plaque in coronary stenosis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary atherosclerotic disease often begins in the transition from childhood to&#xD;
      adolescence, progressing slowly and quietly. Its clinical manifestation occurs in the&#xD;
      majority of cases from the 4th decade of life. However, it is important to remember that&#xD;
      necropsy studies conducted in the 1970s identified the presence of non-obstructive&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta of individuals from the second decade of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From its first description to the present day, the subject has been deeply studied, providing&#xD;
      reliable information on several mechanisms involved in atherogenesis, disease progression and&#xD;
      plaque unstabilization, which may occur in a silent manner or lead to a clinical picture of&#xD;
      unstable myocardial ischemic syndrome (UMIS). In this period, classic risk factors for&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (age, sex, diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia and smoking, among others) were described, and risk scores were&#xD;
      developed that aid in the individual prediction of the probability of disease manifestation&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most widespread of these scores is that developed from the population of Framingham,&#xD;
      which was started in the United States of the same name after 1948. Subjects with no evidence&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease were followed prospectively with biannual evaluations. The data&#xD;
      obtained allowed the elaboration of an algorithm of prediction of individual risk that is&#xD;
      included in the most recent recommendations of evaluation of cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these traditional clinical assessment scores tend to underestimate cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk in some populations, especially in women and young individuals. In the global&#xD;
      population, the various clinical scores used have a predictive accuracy for ischemic events,&#xD;
      as assessed by the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, ranging from 0.73 to 0.79.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, the concept of &quot;detection interval&quot; is proposed. Defined by the difference&#xD;
      between cases of coronary disease or cardiovascular events detected and the actual total&#xD;
      prevalence of atherosclerotic disease in the population, such detection interval opens a new&#xD;
      field for the introduction of new non-invasive atherosclerosis investigation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account that approximately 50% of coronary events occur in previously&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients, the early detection of these individuals at greater risk has become an&#xD;
      important research target within the current cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the development of radiologic techniques, fundamentally coronary angiography&#xD;
      of multiple detectors (CAMD) and electron beam computed tomography (EBCT), have demonstrated&#xD;
      that the degree of coronary calcification correlates with endothelial lesion and individual&#xD;
      prognosis in the long term, allowing to refine the clinical classification of a patient's&#xD;
      risk for a greater or lesser chance of fatal and non-fatal events. Notably, the calcium score&#xD;
      has a weak correlation with the severity of coronary stenosis per se, possibly due to&#xD;
      variations in the arterial remodeling due to coronary calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, calcification of the coronary arteries is known to be associated with&#xD;
      lower myocardial blood flow even in the absence of significant stenosis. This means that&#xD;
      calcification is not merely a marker of obstructive coronary disease and may predispose&#xD;
      patients to myocardial ischemia by mechanisms other than those traditionally known and may&#xD;
      therefore be a marker of endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the application of CAMD allowed the detection of a small magnitude&#xD;
      atheromatosis , not diagnosed clinically by the tests provoking ischemia or even by&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced coronary angiography. The clinical relevance of these alterations,&#xD;
      evaluated by their correlation with the presence of plaque vulnerability markers, mainly&#xD;
      platelet aggregation, vascular reactivity, and inflammation, is still very little studied,&#xD;
      being the main objective of this study.&#xD;

    <description>Comparing Global Risk Score (global risk of coronary heart disease - is a calculation of the absolute risk of having a coronary heart disease event in 10 years. Some variables are analyzed: Age (40-79 years), Gender (male or female), Total cholesterol (130-320mg/dL), HDL cholesterol(20-100mg/dL), Systolic blood pressure (90-200mmHg), Diastolic blood pressure (30-140mmHg), Treated for high blood pressure (Yes ou Not), Diabetes (Yes or Not) and Smoker (Yes or Not). After calculation we have a final number and its respective risk (%) of developing cardiovascular disease. With this, we classify the patient in Low risk(&lt; 5% to have coronary disease in 10 years), Moderate Risk ( Men ≥ 5% e ≤ 20% and Woman ≥ 5% e ≤ 10%) and High risk ( Men &gt;20% and Woman &gt; 10%). We will compare this Global Risk Score in case and control group.</description>
