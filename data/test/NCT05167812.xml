      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined as the loss of two or more conceptions before the&#xD;
      fetus reaches viability. It affects 1-3% of all fertile couples and despite extensive&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up, in only around 30% an underlying cause is identified. Several factors may&#xD;
      increase the risk for miscarriage, but the chance of a normal, successful pregnancy is still&#xD;
      high. So, in supporting couples with RPL, an important part of the clinical management of&#xD;
      these couples is to provide couples with accurate prognoses for their next pregnancy. The&#xD;
      main limitation in current prediction models is the lack of a sufficiently large cohort,&#xD;
      adjustment for relevant risk factors such that prognoses are individualized, and separating&#xD;
      between the cumulative live birth rate and the chance that the next conception will lead to a&#xD;
      live birth. In this project therefore we aim to make an individualized prognosis regarding&#xD;
      the future chance of live birth and the chance of a healthy child. This could then lead to&#xD;
      improved wellbeing and the ability of making future reproductive choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to predict the chance of a live birth within three years after intake in&#xD;
      couples with unexplained RPL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to predict the chance of an ongoing pregnancy (&gt;12 weeks) in the next pregnancy in&#xD;
           couples with unexplained RPL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to predict the chance of a complicated pregnancy in couples with unexplained RPL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to predict the chance dynamically of a live birth given the outcome of a pregnancy after&#xD;
           intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to predict the chance of above outcomes in couples with a known cause for RPL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A multicenter retrospective and prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Couples with females aged ≤42 years in both prospective and retrospective inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective inclusion: Couples with RPL who visited the RPL outpatient clinic in&#xD;
      participating centers from 2006 until the start of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective inclusion: new couples with RPL who will visit the clinic from 2021 onwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy outcomes since intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to pregnancy since intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time between pregnancies since intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy complications since intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All outcomes will be obtained up to a maximum of five years after intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient characteristics: cause for RPL, female age, male age, previous live birth,&#xD;
           duration of RPL (since diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating in this study does not yield any risks. There could be a burden in case of&#xD;
      retrospectively collecting data. Participating does not yield direct benefits for the&#xD;
      subjects, however it may lead to future improvements of care for couples with RPL.&#xD;
