  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular fibrillation (VF)-related sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a leading cause of&#xD;
      mortality. Patients may survive with neurological damage despite state-of-the-art treatment.&#xD;
      Current biological and imaging parameters show significant limitations on early predicting&#xD;
      cerebral performance at hospital admission. A spectral-based model was recently suggested to&#xD;
      correlate time-dependent VF spectral changes with acute cerebral injury in comatose survivors&#xD;
      after cardiac arrest, which opens the possibility to implement early prognostic tools in&#xD;
      clinical practice. The AWAKE trial is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, observational&#xD;
      trial aiming to validate a spectral-based model to early predict cerebral performance and&#xD;
      survival in resuscitated comatose survivors admitted to specialized intensive care units. The&#xD;
      primary clinical outcome is favorable neurological performance (FNP) during hospitalization.&#xD;
      Patients will be categorized into 4 subsets of NP according to the risk score obtained from&#xD;
      the predictive model. The secondary clinical outcomes are survival to hospital discharge, and&#xD;
      FNP and survival after 6 months of follow-up. Model-derived categorization will be compared&#xD;
      with clinical outcomes to assess model sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be included prospectively and retrospectively, using an electronic Case Report&#xD;
      Form to enter data from medical records and in-person interviews. Patients will be divided&#xD;
      into: study group (predictive data required) including comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale -GCS- ≤8)&#xD;
      survivors undergoing temperature control after return of spontaneous circulation (RoSC), and&#xD;
      control group including patients who regain consciousness (GCS=15) after RoSC. VF tracings&#xD;
      prior to the first DC shock will be digitized and analyzed to derive spectral data and risk&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;

      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AWAKE trial is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, observational trial currently&#xD;
      underway in 4 centers in Spain (Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Hospital Universitario La Paz,&#xD;
      Hospital General Universitario de Ciudad Real, and Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón),&#xD;
      and open to more participant hospitals. Only tertiary care hospitals with extensive expertise&#xD;
      in the management of SCD and post-resuscitation care will participate in the trial. All of&#xD;
      them are required to have on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week availability for percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention, and critical care units staffed by cardiologists and/or critical care&#xD;
      specialists. This selective center recruitment is supported by recent data suggesting that&#xD;
      direct admission to invasive heart centers is associated with lower mortality in patients&#xD;
      with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients admitted to the hospital after out or in-hospital cardiac arrest due to&#xD;
      VF will be registered and screened for potential inclusion in the study. Patients will be&#xD;
      classified into either of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study group: comatose survivors (GCS ≤8) after RoSC and, in whom neurological prognosis&#xD;
           is unknown at the time of admission. This group is divided into a prospective cohort&#xD;
           (new admissions), and a retrospective one, in which cases will be obtained from existing&#xD;
           databases in the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: patients who are conscious (GCS=15) and whose neurological status is&#xD;
           known and good at admission. This will be the control group for the spectral-based&#xD;
           predictive model, setting the gold standard for predicting FNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of the Hospital Clínico San&#xD;
      Carlos, which in is in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Every patient will be&#xD;
      requested to sign the informed consent before inclusion in the trial. If patient's condition&#xD;
      makes it unfeasible to obtain a signed informed consent, it will be requested to their next&#xD;
      of kin. Prospective patients will be requested to sign the informed consent during hospital&#xD;
      admission, whereas retrospective patients/relatives will sign the informed consent at the&#xD;
      time of follow-up contact. The main investigator at each participating center will be&#xD;
      responsible for its on-site obtainment and storage according to current Spanish law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decisions to withdraw advanced life support will be led by the physician in charge and&#xD;
      discussed with representatives according to institutional standards, with no intervention&#xD;
      whatsoever from the investigating team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will need to fulfill all of the inclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      also apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature management in comatose survivors after cardiac arrest due to ventricular&#xD;
      fibrillation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study group must have undergone therapeutic mild hypothermia (target&#xD;
      temperature 32 to 34ºC) or controlled normothermia (target temperature 36ºC) for at least 24&#xD;
      hours according to the institution protocol, as long the it is in agreement with current&#xD;
      requirements. Routine use of prehospital or in-hospital cooling during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation with rapid infusion of large volumes of cold intravenous fluid is discouraged,&#xD;
      due to lack of evidence to improve neurological outcome or mortality. Rewarming strategies&#xD;
      (e.g. passive or active rewarming) are open depending on institutional standards. Sedation,&#xD;
      drug-induced paralysis during mechanical ventilation, the use of cardiovascular drugs,&#xD;
      support devices or any other intensive care therapy is left at the criteria of the treating&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and spectral analysis of VF tracings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data, either from the prospective or the retrospective cohort, will be entered in an&#xD;
      electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) by individual investigators at each center. Demographic&#xD;
      and clinical variables will be obtained from all available medical records and by in-person&#xD;
      interview, if possible. Clinical variables and biomarkers as neuron-specific enolase (highest&#xD;
      recorded value), electroencephalogram, somatosensory evoked potentials (N20 component with&#xD;
      median nerve stimulation) and brain imaging, are encouraging to be collected in the&#xD;
      prospective cohort, if available. VF recordings prior to the first DC shock will be scanned&#xD;
      using commercial desktop scanners (600 dots per inch) and uploaded to the eCRF. Data&#xD;
      consistency and quality will be weekly monitored by one of the investigators (M.M.B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stored ECG traces in a codified digital format will be processed as reported elsewhere.&#xD;
      Briefly, digitization will be performed using a supervised semi-automatic approach based on&#xD;
      region of interest selection, histogram thresholding and intensity transformations. Up to 5-s&#xD;
      long segments are extracted after segmentation and signal codification from artifact-free VF&#xD;
      tracings. Signals are band-pass filtered between 1.5 and 40 Hz. Two independent investigators&#xD;
      will visually inspect the extraction quality (J.G.Q and M.M.B). Averaged power spectral&#xD;
      density will be obtained at each frequency using the non-parametric Welch method for using&#xD;
      fast Fourier transform and normalized to the peak power in the 1.5-10 Hz band for each&#xD;
      patient. Dominant frequency (DF), the relative power between high and low frequency bands&#xD;
      (cut-off: 3.9 Hz) (HL-PSDR), and the relative number of spectral peaks above and below the&#xD;
      3.9 Hz threshold with power above 40% the frequency with the highest power (rHL-pKR), along&#xD;
      with the number of DC shocks before ROSC, will be the variables used to obtain a&#xD;
      model-derived risk score for outcome prediction. Investigators blinded to clinical outcome&#xD;
      will perform all data analysis, extraction and quantification using custom-made scripts of&#xD;
      MATLAB software (V. 2016b, The Mathworks). The results of such analysis will not be disclosed&#xD;
      to the treating physicians and site investigators, not to interfere in standard care,&#xD;
      decision-making and outcome assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical outcome will be FNP during hospitalization. All patients will be&#xD;
      classified using the Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) outcome categorization&#xD;
      of brain injury, according to current standards of care for SCD assessment. Patients will be&#xD;
      considered to have FNP if they score 1 or 2 in the CPC scale (good performance and moderate&#xD;
      disability, respectively). CPCs 3, 4 and 5 (severe disability, vegetative state and brain&#xD;
      death, respectively) will be considered as a non-FNP. In the prospective cohort, neurological&#xD;
      outcome will also be determined using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). The threshold&#xD;
      value in MMSE for normal cognitive function is 24/30, which will be used as complementary&#xD;
      neurological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the prospective cohort, neurological outcome will be established before hospital&#xD;
      discharge. In the retrospective cohort, the assessment will be done using medical records and&#xD;
      in-person interviews with the patient or relatives. During follow-up, neurological outcome&#xD;
      will be prospectively assessed by in-person interview in all survivors. Patients within the&#xD;
      prospective cohort will be evaluated 6 months after hospitalization. In the retrospective&#xD;
      cohort, the follow-up will take place at the moment of patient enrolment or contact with&#xD;
      patient´s relatives, in case of decease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary clinical outcomes will be survival to hospital discharge, and FNP and survival&#xD;
      at follow-up. The control group will be used to test the predictive model against a cohort of&#xD;
      patients with known FNP, in which the model should also properly predict FNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and study timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated using the diagnostic performance obtained from the pivotal&#xD;
      study. The spectral-based four-variable model using DF, HL-PkR , HL-PSDR, and the number of&#xD;
      shocks delivered before ROSC, showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.94. Looking for a 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval and 5% precision, and assuming that 61% patients will show FNP according&#xD;
      to our previous research, a total 143 individuals (both prospective and retrospective&#xD;
      cohorts) suitable for analysis must be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that each of the aforementioned centers receives ~60 SCD per year, but only&#xD;
      around one fourth of them will fulfill the inclusion criteria, namely VF as first documented&#xD;
      rhythm and ECG tracing availability. Considering the inclusion of 2 more centers (currently&#xD;
      undertaking protocol evaluation), the incidence of annual new cases per hospital and&#xD;
      retrospective cases from previous years, the sample size will be achieved in a time frame of&#xD;
      30 months. The latter includes the follow-up period for the last group of patients who will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study. As of the writing of this manuscript, the starting center (Hospital&#xD;
      Clínico San Carlos) has already evaluated 60 patients, of who 21 met the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and are enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the study group (prospective and retrospective) will be categorized according&#xD;
      to the risk score obtained from the multivariate spectral-based model. More specifically,&#xD;
      patients will be categorized within four subsets for FNP as follows: very high and high&#xD;
      probability of FNP (expected FNP), low and very low probability of FNP (expected non-FNP).&#xD;
      Model-derived categorization will be compared with clinical outcomes to assess model&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity and accuracy during hospitalization and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the clinical relevance of the spectral-based model the investigators will&#xD;
      compare its performance and overall accuracy with a model built using the most associated and&#xD;
      clinically relevant variables (e.g. highest recorded value of neuron-specific enolase,&#xD;
      somatosensory evoked potentials) to the primary outcome. To develop a clinical-based&#xD;
      predictive model, each of the clinical variables will undergo univariate analysis to evaluate&#xD;
      its association with in-hospital FNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal distribution of variables will be assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical&#xD;
      significance will be assessed by the parametric Student's t-test or the non-parametric&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate. If necessary, the investigators will use Bonferroni&#xD;
      correction for multiple comparisons. Categorical variables and percentile comparisons will be&#xD;
      performed using a Chi-squared test or the Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Two-sided&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Variables with statistically significant&#xD;
      differences and clinically relevant variables will be regressed out against the in-hospital&#xD;
      FNP by using a stepwise backwards multivariate logistic regression approach. The&#xD;
      clinical-based model will be developed to predict FNP with the highest sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity achievable by using the minimum number of variables that guarantees the best&#xD;
      performance and predictive accuracy.&#xD;
