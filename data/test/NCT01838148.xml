      The primary aim is to perform the largest study worldwide to evaluate novel biochemical and&#xD;
      electrocardiographic signatures alone as well as in combination with the standard 12-lead&#xD;
      exercise ECG in the detection of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia (diagnostic endpoint).&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to evaluate these innovative tools in the risk prediction for the&#xD;
      occurrence of cardiovascular death and acute myocardial infarction during long-term&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

      Background: The detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most important tasks&#xD;
      in medicine. Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia is the pathophysiological hallmark of&#xD;
      stable CAD. Currently, sophisticated imaging techniques including coronary angiography,&#xD;
      rest/stress myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and&#xD;
      coronary CT-scanning are required to accurately detect CAD. Unfortunately, these techniques&#xD;
      are associated with inherent risks due to substantial radiation exposure, intraarterial or&#xD;
      intravenous application of iodinated contrast media, mechanical complications, require&#xD;
      referral to a specialist, and are very costly. In addition, most of them provide anatomical&#xD;
      but not functional information. For clinical practice, functional information that&#xD;
      differentiates lesions that cause exercise-induced myocardial ischemia from functionally&#xD;
      irrelevant lesions is critical. Exercise electrocardiography (ECG) is a widely used simple&#xD;
      and non-invasive functional test, which however has imperfect sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      (both below 75%) in the detection of CAD. Novel cardiac biomarkers as well as novel&#xD;
      computer-based quantitative approaches to analyse the ECG signal recorded during exercise&#xD;
      offered by advances in information technology and signal processing may provide incremental&#xD;
      value to the exercise ECG and thereby improve clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The primary aim is to perform the largest study worldwide to evaluate novel biochemical&#xD;
      and electrocardiographic signatures alone as well as in combination with the standard 12-lead&#xD;
      exercise ECG in the detection of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia (diagnostic endpoint).&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to evaluate these innovative tools in the risk prediction for the&#xD;
      occurrence of cardiovascular death and acute myocardial infarction during long-term&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: We will enroll approximately 4200 consecutive patients with suspected exercise&#xD;
      induced myocardial ischemia referred for rest/ergometry myocardial perfusion SPECT. SPECT&#xD;
      findings (complemented by coronary angiography and fractional flow reserve [FFR, if availabe]&#xD;
      findings in patients who obtain both investigations) are used to adjudicate and quantify the&#xD;
      presence of myocardial ischemia (the primary diagnostic end point). Clinical long-term&#xD;
      follow-up will be obtained at 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and 8 years to record death,&#xD;
      cardiovascular death, and acute myocardial infarction as well as coronary revascularisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational tests: Venous blood samples will be collected before exercise stress testing&#xD;
      for the determination of biochemical signatures possibly associated with myocardial ischemia&#xD;
      including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, B-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide, IL-6, and cardiac microRNA. In addition, continuous ECG signals are&#xD;
      recorded using 12 leads (16 leads in a subset of patients) and 24-bit amplitude resolution&#xD;
      with 8000 Hz sampling frequency before, during and after the stress test. Novel methods of&#xD;
      computer-based ECG signal-processing technology will be used to decipher electronic markers&#xD;
      of myocardial ischemia and to develop improved software algorithms for automated ECG&#xD;
      interpretation. All investigational tests will be performed in a blinded fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Significance: We hypothesize that biochemical and electrocardiographic signals of&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia will significantly improve the non-invasive detection of exercise-induced&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia. This would markedly improve the initiation of treatment in affected&#xD;
      patients and thus advance medical management of patients with suspected CAD. In addition,&#xD;
      this approach would help to simplify (exercise ECG versus myocardial SPECT) the non-invasive&#xD;
      detection of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia and help to avoid the inherent health&#xD;
      hazards associated current radiologic imaging procedures.&#xD;
