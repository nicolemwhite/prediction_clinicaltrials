      To identify nutritional and metabolic biomarkers that are related to the prognosis of&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury patients, and to develop a prognosis prediction model using biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establishment of a prospective registry for traumatic brain injury patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of nutritional and metabolic biomarkers related to prognosis of traumatic&#xD;
           brain injury patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Development of a prognosis prediction model using nutritional and metabolic biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Development of identification model for high-risk population of disabilities after&#xD;
           traumatic brain injury&#xD;

      Study design: Multicenter observational cohort study, 5 tertiary teaching hospital emergency&#xD;
      departments in Korea&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: July 2018 to December 2023 (66 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Traumatic brain injury patients aged over 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases will be consecutive adult patients with EMS-treated traumatic brain injury and&#xD;
      transport to the 5 emergency departments of participating hospitals within 72 hours after the&#xD;
      trauma and confirmed cerebral hemorrhage or diffuse axial injury by radiological examination.&#xD;
      A prospective traumatic brain injury patient cohort will be developed and all survived&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury cases will be followed at 1-month and 6-month after ED discharge by&#xD;
      telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, the investigators aim to recruit a total 1,200 cases (600 cases&#xD;
      between July 2018 and June 2020, 600 cases between March 2021 and June 2023).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Following data will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data: Basic demographic and clinical outcomes will be retrieved from medical&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey data: Comorbidity, symptom, result of neurologic examination, socioeconomic status&#xD;
      (occupation, income etc) data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: The investigators aim to develop nutritional and metabolic biomarkers of&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury. The investigators also plan to further develop traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      biomarkers using proteomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-ups: All survived traumatic brain injury cases will be followed-up at 1-month and&#xD;
      6-month after ED discharge and their survival, disability, and quality of life outcomes will&#xD;
      be collected by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Statements: All 5 hospitals participating in the study were IRB approved(Seoul&#xD;
      National University Hospital(IRB No: 1806-078-951), SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center(IRB No:&#xD;
      30-2018-85), Kyungpook National University Hospital(IRB No: 2018-10-014-007), Chonnam&#xD;
      National University Hospital(IRB No: CNUH-2018-297), Chungbuk National University&#xD;
      Hospital(IRB No: 2018-09-018)). All study patients was registered in cohort after acquisition&#xD;
      of consent.&#xD;

      To investigate biomarkers, 20ml of blood is collected from study subjects. Blood is collected&#xD;
      first in 2 SST tubes that do not contain anticoagulant, and then blood is collected in 1 EDTA&#xD;
      tube containing anticoagulant. Leave blood sample at room temperature for 1 hour and then&#xD;
      centrifuge for 10 minutes. Finally, the sample separated by serum, plasma, and buffy coat is&#xD;
      stored frozen.&#xD;
