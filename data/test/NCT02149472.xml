  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) remains a cause of significant maternal morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality worldwide. By identifying women with a higher a priori risk of major haemorrhage&#xD;
      during their pregnancy or early during postpartum haemorrhage extra measures to prevent MOH&#xD;
      can be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to identify haemostatic parameters that during the course&#xD;
      of haemorrhage are responsible for the on-going towards major bleeding. By doing this,&#xD;
      cut-off points can be defined for future interventions aiming to stop this bleeding process&#xD;
      in an early stage. Traditional coagulation parameters are currently not useful for clinical&#xD;
      decision making, because of long turn around times. Therefore the added value of available&#xD;
      coagulation 'point of care' tests will be evaluated during obstetric haemorrhage.These&#xD;
      Point-of-Care (POC) tests could lead to a goal-directed haemostatic therapy for obstetric&#xD;
      haemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of 9.500 pregnant women will be followed during their pregnancy and delivery. From&#xD;
      all women a bleeding score will be obtained during their pregnancy by means of a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire. The predictive value of this bleeding score for the occurrence of major&#xD;
      obstetric haemorrhage will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If postpartum haemorrhage develops (blood loss) &gt; 1000 cc, blood samples will be drawn for&#xD;
      conventional haemostatic parameters and ROTEM profiles. The pathway between minor bleeding&#xD;
      and major bleeding will be elucidated. Interchangeability and comparability of conventional&#xD;
      haemostatic parameters and ROTEM profiles will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the investigators is becoming more able to predict major obstetric&#xD;
      haemorrhage in an early stage of postpartum haemorrhage and define thresholds for&#xD;
      goal-directed hemostatic therapies.&#xD;

        All pregnant women in participating hospitals are asked for their informed consent (n =&#xD;
        9.500). All women will complete a bleeding score generating questionnaire duing their&#xD;
        pregnancy. Only from women developing postpartum haemorrhage &gt; 1000 cc blood samples will&#xD;
        be drawn (n = 600) during the course of postpartum haemorrhage for evaluation of changes in&#xD;

&#xD;
        3 months postpartum a nested case cohort study will be performed to compare the incidences&#xD;
        of underlying bleeding disorders in the haemorrhage and non-haemorrhage group. This outcome&#xD;
        will also be related to the obtained bleeding scores during pregnancy.&#xD;
