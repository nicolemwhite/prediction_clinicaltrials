  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To validate the prognostic importance of the burden of new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF)&#xD;
      complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a prospectively designed hospital-based&#xD;
      registry. To characterize those factors that contribute to the progression of post-MI NOAF&#xD;
      burden. To establish a prediction model for the risk stratification of patients with NOAF&#xD;
      complicating AMI. To explore the clinical usefulness of NOAF burden in guiding the&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy among patients with post-MI NOAF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previously designed single-center retrospective cohort study (NCT03533543) suggested that&#xD;
      patients with a greater burden of NOAF complicating AMI were challenged by a poor prognosis.&#xD;
      In the present study, we aim to design a multicenter, prospective, hospital-based registry to&#xD;
      validate the preceding findings. We plan to enroll patients who were admitted for AMI in 9&#xD;
      tertiary medical centers from Shanghai, Henan, and Zhejiang provinces and developed NOAF&#xD;
      during the index hospitalization. All eligible patients' demographics, cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors, comorbidities, laboratory tests, echocardiography data, angiography data, and&#xD;
      medications will be collected. NOAF burden is calculated by dividing the total AF duration by&#xD;
      the total continuous electronic monitoring (CEM) duration. Other NOAF related&#xD;
      characteristics, such as AF pattern, AF frequency, and symptomatic or silent AF, and the&#xD;
      longest AF episode duration will also be evaluated. All patients who are discharged alive&#xD;
      will be followed for at least 2 years and cardiovascular outcomes will be recorded.&#xD;
