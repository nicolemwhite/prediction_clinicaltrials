  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major adverse cardiovascular events are the leading cause of perioperative morbimortality in&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery. Perioperative myocardial infarction is usually asymptomatic, with a&#xD;
      mortality around 10-12%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial Injury in Noncardiac Surgery (MINS), is defined as a myocardial injury that&#xD;
      provokes a troponin increase due to myocardial ischemia. MINS is a predictor of&#xD;
      morbimortality at short term and at long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to improve the diagnosis of myocardial injury after non cardiac&#xD;
      surgery in high-risk patients, improve its treatment in case of MINS and establish prevention&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;

    <measure>Prevalence of myocardial injury after non cardiac surgery (MINS).</measure>
    <time_frame>From the day of surgery until the third postoperative day</time_frame>
    <description>The aim of the study is to know the prevalence of myocardial injury after non cardiac surgery in high-risk surgical patients. The investigators will perform seriated troponin on the first 3 postoperative days, if troponin value are 30ng/L or more, the investigators will evaluate if troponin increase is due to cardiac or non-cardiac etiology (patients with TEP or sepsis will be excluded). Once the non-cardiac etiology is ruled out, it will be diagnosed of MINS</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of MINS which corresponds to myocardial infarction</measure>
    <time_frame>From the day of surgery until the third postoperative day</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the percentage of MINS that corresponds to myocardial infarction. In all patients with the diagnosis of MINS the investigators will perform an ECG to evaluate ischemic changes, an echocardiogram to evaluate dyskinesias or akinesia or the presence of ischemic symptoms. If any of them are present, the investigators will diagnose the patient of acute myocardial infarction. So the investigators will compare number of patients who present a MINS with and without myocardial infarction.</description>

    <description>To compare short and long term prognosis (hospital discharge, 30 days, 6 months and 1 year after surgery) of patients who presented MINS vs patients who presented myocardial infarction vs patients who did not presented any of them. The investigators will evaluate major cardiovascular events, non-cardiovascular complications and cardiac and all cause mortality.</description>
