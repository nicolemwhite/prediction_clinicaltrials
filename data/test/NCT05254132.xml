      SALMON is a prospective, multi-center, multi-country, biomarker validation study that&#xD;
      synergizes an extensive non-interventional biomarker discovery study on diagnostic images and&#xD;
      tissue biopsies of non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC (rATLAS) with a smaller biomarker&#xD;
      minimally interventional study on patients with metastases who undergo liquid biopsy and&#xD;
      imaging follow-up for 2 years (aRECIST). A total of 1120 patients will be screened to get&#xD;
      1000 participants enrolled in rATLAS, and a subset of 250 participants will be screened to&#xD;
      then recruit 150 participants also for aRECIST. The study will end after one visit for&#xD;
      participants in rATLAS while there is a 2-years follow-up period for participants in aRECIST.&#xD;
      Participants will not receive any treatment specific for this study, but might receive&#xD;
      standard of care therapy or investigational products in the framework of another clinical&#xD;
      study following the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of optimizing AI based tools for the assessment of EGFR status (rATLAS) and&#xD;
      automated Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) (aRECIST) will be&#xD;
      achieved using a trial design that combines a biomarker discovery study design&#xD;
      (cross-sectional for rATLAS) with a reader study design (follow-up study in aRECIST). Medical&#xD;
      treatments in the aRECIST cohort are not dictated by study protocol, rather determined by the&#xD;
      clinicians in line with standard clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, accounting for an&#xD;
      estimated 2.1 million deaths in 2018. About 80%-85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. The main&#xD;
      subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.&#xD;
      These subtypes, which start from different types of lung cells, are grouped together as&#xD;
      NSCLC. For these reasons, the choice of NSCLC for this trial is the most relevant, as there&#xD;
      is a clear societal burden / clinical need that will be addressed in SALMON.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pressing need exists to uncover the genetic and molecular composition of tumors, as this&#xD;
      information would accelerate the development of more effective cancer therapies. Since tumors&#xD;
      differ in their biological makeup, treatments can now often be tailored towards individual&#xD;
      patients, in a strategy termed personalized medicine. NSCLC perfectly illustrates this&#xD;
      paradigm, with treatments either targeted at well-defined oncogenic pathways (epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) &amp; receptor tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase 1 (ROS1) gene rearrangements, B-Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma gene (BRAF)&#xD;
      mutations), and for so-called &quot;wild-type&quot; NSCLC, immunotherapy (with or without&#xD;
      chemotherapy). The recent development of different types of immunotherapy has led to&#xD;
      promising advances in the treatment of patients with NSCLC in advanced or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in the assessment of tumors, including lung cancer, as&#xD;
      it provides non-invasively the features to identify, characterize and stage the local tumor&#xD;
      and its overall metastatic burden. The information provided by imaging can be still improved&#xD;
      with a thorough post-processing analysis of the images, with &quot;radiomics&quot; being the most&#xD;
      sophisticated tool for quantitative imaging. Through radiomics the imaging data obtained can&#xD;
      be linked to specific biological properties of the tumor, acquired either from tissue or&#xD;
      liquid biopsies. However, the knowledge on this is fragmented to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of this trial is to generate a radiomics atlas (rATLAS) that provides a&#xD;
      broader link between biological descriptors and medical imaging features in NSCLC, to&#xD;
      eventually identify oncologic pathways through medical images and quantify the overall burden&#xD;
      of specific markers for targeted therapies. In particular, imaging biomarkers that can&#xD;
      predict immunosensitivity and more accurately predict the prognosis than the existing ones&#xD;
      will be assessed on the medical images and compared to tissue and liquid biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from NSCLC diagnosis and staging, imaging plays a key role also in the evaluation of&#xD;
      patient's follow-up, representing the gold standard for the assessment of response to&#xD;
      therapy. However, the evaluation of medical images is amenable to radiologist's&#xD;
      interpretation and many attempts have been made to face this issue in the last decades. The&#xD;
      RECIST is a one-dimensional measure (shortest/longest diameter in the plane of measurement)&#xD;
      created in 2000, updated in 2009 (RECIST 1.1), with a branch for immunotherapy finalized in&#xD;
      2017 (iRECIST). RECIST, in all its different declination, is used to assess whether a tumor&#xD;
      in cancer patients is progressing, regressing or did not change before and after some event,&#xD;
      such as therapy. RECIST criteria are recognized both in the EU and in US. Although&#xD;
      representing an international attempt to overcome the subjective evaluation of tumor response&#xD;
      to cancer treatment, biases of measurements remain as it relies on human assessments. In 1976&#xD;
      Moertel and Hanley acknowledged that &quot;the culmination of most experimental therapeutic trials&#xD;
      for solid tumors occurs when a [physician] places a ruler or caliper over a lump and attempts&#xD;
      to estimate its size,&quot; and with this measurement comes the inevitable component of human&#xD;
      error. In 2021 this issue is still present in clinical practice, but in the last years&#xD;
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated remarkable progress in image-recognition tasks&#xD;
      in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators propose to eliminate the shortcomings of measurement biases with the&#xD;
      second objective of our trial that is focused on the validation of a new automated RECIST&#xD;
      (aRECIST) workflow for the assessment of therapy response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained from each patient before any&#xD;
      screening procedures are conducted. The participants will be prospectively enrolled to rATLAS&#xD;
      only, to both rATLAS and aRECIST, or considered as screen failure. If enrolled then a unique&#xD;
      study-specific subject number shall be assigned, Informed consent form will be signed and the&#xD;
      following evaluations will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be obtained for each participant from medical files and records:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data (Age, Gender, Race, country);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric data (Weight in kg, Height in cm, body mass index (BMI) in kg/m^2);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history (comorbidities, oncology-related history, Chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
           disease (COPD), Interstitial lung disease (ILD), Pulmonary vascular disease, history&#xD;
           related to NSCLC);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Substance use (cigarettes/e-cigarettes/alcohol), duration and dose/frequency [smoking&#xD;
           required, others optional];&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant treatment only linked to immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and&#xD;
           targeted therapy (subtype, drug name, line of treatment (first/second/third line),&#xD;
           reason for discontinuation (completed regimen/completed response/progression&#xD;
           disease/toxicity/other);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 to 5);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histological diagnosis (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma,&#xD;
           adenosquamous cell carcinoma, other);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratoristic data: Hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes, neutrophils,&#xD;
           eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets) and Chemistry (sodium,&#xD;
           bicarbonate, chloride, calcium, albumin, magnesium, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen,&#xD;
           protein, urea, potassium, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, bilirubin,&#xD;
           direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),&#xD;
           alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),&#xD;
           squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From clinical examination and imaging (and multidisciplinary discussion report if available)&#xD;
      the following data will be recorded per participant: Clinical Tumor Staging (cTNM) upon&#xD;
      initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Radiology department the following data will be recorded per participant: The staging&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scan data already performed at the site per standard of care (SoC)&#xD;
      will be pseudo-anonymized and sent to the central reader, along with Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET)/CT and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans obtained per patient&#xD;
      staging, when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, depending on group (aRECIST or rATLAS), the following steps will also be considered:&#xD;
&#xD;
      rATLAS: Diagnostic samples of tissue biopsy (ideally 1 block or 25 slides - minimum required:&#xD;
      10 slides) performed at the participating site per standard of care will be shipped to the&#xD;
      central laboratory for testing on oncogenic biomarkers. After this baseline visit all&#xD;
      participants in rATLAS may start their treatment as per SoC. rATLAS study ends after this&#xD;
      baseline and enrolment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      aRECIST: A liquid biopsy will be obtained (blood sample, 1 tube of 10 ml) and shipped within&#xD;
      2 days to the central laboratory for oncogenic biomarker testing. In order not to influence&#xD;
      therapeutic decision making, biomarker results will be shared with the sites only after the&#xD;
      decision concerning NSCLC therapy has been made. Diagnostic samples of tissue biopsy which&#xD;
      have been obtained for ATLAS (ideally 1 block or 25 slides - minimum required: 10 slides)&#xD;
      performed at the participating site per standard of care will be shipped to the central&#xD;
      laboratory for oncogenetic biomarker testing. In those cases where standard tissue biopsy is&#xD;
      not obtained, fine needle biopsy and cells obtained per SoC by fine needle aspiration could&#xD;
      be analyzed and send to the central laboratory following specific procedures. Enough material&#xD;
      should be available to be analyzed, otherwise the genetic testing would not be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline all participants of the aRECIST group will undergo standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      and/or immunotherapy and will be followed up for a maximum of 2 years to investigate a&#xD;
      possible treatment response (manual local &amp; central and automated RECIST) by imaging&#xD;
      parameters and liquid biopsy. These participants will need to return to the clinic for liquid&#xD;
      biopsies (2 tubes of 10 mL) at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months within 5 days (before or after) of&#xD;
      their imaging follow-up as per SoC. It is the site staff that will be responsible for&#xD;
      providing a copy of all relevant post-treatment CT-scans (and PET/CT scan if available) as&#xD;
      taken per SoC together with local RECIST scoring, NSCLC treatment(s) information (class,&#xD;
      dose, duration) and NSCLC-related events. The data will be collected at time-points as per&#xD;
      standard of care (at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months approximately). The participant's participation&#xD;
      to aRECIST will end 2 years after baseline or earlier in case of death or any event that in&#xD;
      the opinion of the investigator requires an early termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the site staff will be responsible to provide a liquid biopsy (2 tubes of 10ml&#xD;
      each) and to share the following data at 3 (visit1), 6 (visit 2), 12 (visit 3), and 24 (visit&#xD;
      4) months):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A copy of all relevant post-treatment CT scans - and PET/CT scans if available - as&#xD;
           taken per SoC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed description of CT acquisition for each participant, including contrast media&#xD;
           injection characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local reading of treatment response by using RECIST 1.1 criteria (manual local reading),&#xD;
           along with the time needed for evaluating each participant,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A liquid biopsy (2 tubes of 10 ml each) within 5 days of the CT scan performed for&#xD;
           participant follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NSCLC treatment(s) information (class, dose, duration, specific timeframes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NSCLC-related events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any rATLAS participant are considered as having completed the study after performing the&#xD;
      initial baseline visit (Day 0), except for those also participating to aRECIST. Participants&#xD;
      of aRECIST are considered as having completed the study after the 2-year follow-up period, or&#xD;
      earlier, in case of death or any event that in the opinion of the investigator requires an&#xD;
      early termination.&#xD;
