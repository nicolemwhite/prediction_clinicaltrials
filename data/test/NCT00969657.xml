      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of rectal tumor response after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) might be helpful in&#xD;
      individualizing treatment strategies, i.e., selecting patients who need less invasive surgery&#xD;
      or another radiotherapy strategy instead of resection. For rectal cancer it is known that&#xD;
      10-30% of the patients will respond with a pathologic complete response (pCR) after CRT. From&#xD;
      a retrospective study with multivariate analysis of both clinical and 2-[18F]&#xD;
      fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data, it was found that&#xD;
      adding FDG-PET data collected before and after CRT leads to a more predictive model compared&#xD;
      to evaluating only pretreatment clinical data. To validate this model, this registration&#xD;
      study is proposed. Furthermore, it has been found that FDG-PET during treatment is very&#xD;
      predictive for response and a more favorable time point to adapt treatment. Also, there are&#xD;
      indications that adding blood biomarkers to the data, results in higher accuracy for response&#xD;
      prediction compared to clinical and imaging data alone. Therefore, FDG-PET during treatment&#xD;
      and blood sampling are included in the protocol to improve the accuracy of the prediction&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term research objective is to be able to select rectum cancer patients who could&#xD;
      receive a less invasive treatment. If prediction of response is possible, surgery may be&#xD;
      avoided when complete response after chemoradiotherapy is expected or performed with smaller&#xD;
      incisions if stage reduction is significant. This support decision system helps to&#xD;
      individualize patient treatment and can improve the quality of life for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      28x radiotherapy. On day 15 of radiotherapy en 8 weeks after radiotherapy: 1 PET-CT scan&#xD;
      Before radiotherapy, on day 15 and 8 weeks after radiotherapy: blood sample taken.&#xD;

      General objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term research objective is to be able to select rectum cancer patients who could&#xD;
      receive a less invasive treatment. If prediction of response is possible, surgery may be&#xD;
      avoided when complete response after chemoradiotherapy is expected or performed with smaller&#xD;
      incisions if stage reduction is significant. This support decision system helps to&#xD;
      individualize patient treatment and can improve the quality of life for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim is to validate a predictive model for pathologic complete response (ypT0N0) in&#xD;
      rectal cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy by multi-centric prospective data&#xD;
      collection. The second aim is to collect extra data for improvement of the accuracy of the&#xD;
      prediction models with new variables. This new model will be validated later in the model&#xD;
      development process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      General hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validated accuracy of predictive models for pathologic complete response after&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer patients is high enough to tailor treatment&#xD;
      (surgery/non-surgery and/or administer extra radiation boosts) in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The performance of the developed models on the validation data is at least equal to the&#xD;
           performance achieved during the model development process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The performance of a new model based on the addition of variables performs better than&#xD;
           the previous model&#xD;
