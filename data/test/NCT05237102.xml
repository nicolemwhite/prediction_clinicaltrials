  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hydrocephalus are usually treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CFS) shunt to deal&#xD;
      with excess cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. However, it is difficult to distinguish whether&#xD;
      ventricular enlargement is due to hydrocephalus or other causes, such as brain injury and&#xD;
      compensatory brain atrophy after surgery. Therefore, it is important to predict whether&#xD;
      shunting will help patients. For this reason, clinicians must be cautious when treating&#xD;
      patients with shunt therapy. Important assessments of the level of consciousness and&#xD;
      continuous lumbar tap test are currently clinically common predictors before making decisions&#xD;
      about CFS shunt therapy. However, for patients with serious disturbance of consciousness, it&#xD;
      is difficult to predict the prognosis of surgery by observing the improvement of symptoms&#xD;
      after lumbar tap test, which brings difficulties to the majority of clinical workers, and&#xD;
      also easy to bring serious psychological and economic burden to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, clinicians still lack a stable and objective method to predict&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical study, when participants performed the cerebrospinal fluid tap test to&#xD;
      evaluate whether or not cerebrospinal fluid shunt was performed, various predictors that may&#xD;
      be associated with CSF shunt outcomes before and after cerebrospinal fluid tap test were&#xD;
      collected, including imaging data, EEG characteristics and changes in cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      pressure. In addition, the researchers will collect the improvement of consciousness&#xD;
      disturbance in patients with hydrocephalus before and after cerebrospinal fluid shunt, in&#xD;
      order to explore the correlation between preoperative imaging data, EEG characteristics, the&#xD;
      results of cerebrospinal fluid tap test and the improvement of consciousness disorders. A&#xD;
      scheme of consciousness assessment based on the results of imaging, EEG and tap test results&#xD;
      afte CSF tap test was proposed.&#xD;

    <description>The procedure is designed to reduce the amount of cerebrospinal fluid in a patient's brain by draining it through a shunt tube:&#xD;
①V-P shunt is suitable for most types of hydrocephalus; ②L-P shunt is suitable for traffic hydrocephalus and positive pressure hydrocephalus, and patients with lower cerebellar tonsil hernia are contraindications; ③ Common terms of ventriculoatrial (V-A) shunt are not suitable for V-P shunt (abdominal infection, serious respiratory and circulatory diseases are contraindications); ④ The third ventriculostomy is suitable for patients with non-traffic and partial traffic hydrocephalus （infants and patients with severe ventricular enlargement should be cautious, and patients with shunt tube cannot be placed due to ventricular conditions）; ⑤Other shunt methods include septum pellucidum fistula and Torshunt （ventriculo-occipital cistern shunt after tumor resection）</description>
