  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a data-driven, retrospective, longitudinal, population- based, observational,&#xD;
      multi-centered study using secondary data captured from congruent electronic health records&#xD;
      (EHRs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pathologically documented locally recurrent or inoperable advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer that progressed during or after prior treatment for primary invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
      Documented HER2 and estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PgR) expression status&#xD;
      evaluated both in the invasive component of the primary carcinoma of the breast (in the early&#xD;
      setting) and primary or metastatic lesion (in the advanced setting) is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to determine the primary endpoint is estimated to be derived from the EHRs of over 2,000&#xD;
      patients that have been diagnosed of early breast cancer between 2005 and 2020, and who&#xD;
      developed locally recurrent or advanced inoperable breast cancer between January 2015 and&#xD;
      January 2020 in at least 10 clinical centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints utilize a larger collection of data from over 30,000 patients with&#xD;
      early and/or advanced breast cancer diagnose between 2015 and 2020.&#xD;

             recommendations at the time of diagnose, during early and/or advanced setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: In patients with locally recurrent or advanced inoperable breast cancer, HER2&#xD;
             expression should have been performed on the most recent tumor biopsy since last&#xD;
             progression from metastatic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Is documented as hormone receptor (HR)-positive (either estrogen receptor [ER]- and/or&#xD;
             progesterone receptor [PgR]-positive [ER or PgR ≥1%]) or HR- negative (ER- and&#xD;

             setting.&#xD;

             outcomes, and genomic profile. Centers that agree to participate must commit to&#xD;
             include all subjects who meet the inclusion criteria, in order to reduce possible&#xD;
