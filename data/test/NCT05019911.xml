    <textblock>
      Millimeter wave radar will be used to conduct non-contact monitoring continuously for&#xD;
      patients' vital signs (eg. respiratory rate, heart rate, and chest/abdominal movement). The&#xD;
      monitoring information will be transmitted to the central system through network and&#xD;
      displayed in real time. Comparison with polysomnography will be done to examine the&#xD;
      consistency between the two devices in diagnosing sleep breathing disorders. The predictive&#xD;
      model of acute exacerbations of COPD will be established with the baseline indicators&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;

      Significance: This study will conduct non-contact monitoring among COPD patients with sleep&#xD;
      apnea hypopnea for respiratory rate, heart rate, respiratory rhythm and thoracic amplitude.&#xD;
      This monitoring could not only offer patients a more comfortable medical environment, but&#xD;
      also maintain high quality of monitoring, which would help build the platform for prediction&#xD;
      and management of COPD combined with sleep breathing disorders with great clinical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: The misdiagnosis, underdiagnosis and disease burden of sleep breathing disorders&#xD;
      in patients with COPD are high, which is one of the neglected problems in the management of&#xD;
      COPD in China at present. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among COPD patients&#xD;
      is 37.9-52.8%. Patients with overlapping COPD and OSA had more frequent hypoxemia during&#xD;
      sleep and a longer total sleep duration for hypoxemia and hypercapnia than patients with OSA&#xD;
      or COPD alone. The millimeter-wave radar equipment used in this study is from Qinglei&#xD;
      Intelligent Health Care Life Support System. The system is based on millimeter wave radar&#xD;
      intellisense and artificial intelligence technology, geared to the needs of health&#xD;
      institutions, community endowment, family endowment, medical institutions, etc., to provide&#xD;
      sleep monitoring, monitoring vital signs data, user behavior analysis, life vigor analysis,&#xD;
      user exception alarm, falling alarm, diagnosis and screening of chronic respiratory disease,&#xD;
      help with primary screening and early diagnosis of the disease and the patient-centered&#xD;
      personalized precision diagnosis and treatment, enable early detection and treatment of&#xD;
      health risks through scientific and technological means, and make more effective use of&#xD;
      medical resources. The Peking University Third Hospital has actively promoted the&#xD;
      construction of Internet-based medical services, and has passed the on-site evaluation of&#xD;
      Internet hospital qualification, and realized Internet-based diagnosis and treatment. The&#xD;
      Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine has been engaged in clinical and applied&#xD;
      basic research on COPD and its complications for a long time, which has a in-depth research&#xD;
      foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To verify the consistency between millimeter wave radar equipment and traditional&#xD;
      sleep monitoring equipment in the collection of respiratory rate, heart rate and respiratory&#xD;
      movement of patients with COPD alone or COPD combined with sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome.&#xD;
      Combined with pulse oxygen saturation, end expiratory CO2 monitoring and other indicators,&#xD;
      the data model established is conducive to early detection of aggravation of COPD combined&#xD;
      with sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome based on clinical indicators, which has important clinical&#xD;
      value in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content: Millimeter wave radar will be used to conduct non-contact monitoring continuously&#xD;
      for patients' vital signs (eg. respiratory rate, heart rate, and chest/abdominal movement).&#xD;
      The monitoring information will be transmitted to the central system through network and&#xD;
      displayed in real time. Comparison with polysomnography will be done to examine the&#xD;
      consistency between the two devices in diagnosing sleep breathing disorders. The predictive&#xD;
      model of acute exacerbations of COPD will be established with the baseline indicators&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The patients with COPD alone and patients with COPD combined with sleep apnea&#xD;
      hypopnea were monitored by traditional sleep monitoring equipment and millimeter wave radar&#xD;
      equipment. The patients were continuously monitored by millimeter wave radar equipment and&#xD;
      followed up for acute exacerbation of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period: October 2021-September 2022 Expected results: The consistency between non-contact&#xD;
      millimeter-wave radar equipment and routine clinical monitoring in the diagnosis of COPD&#xD;
      combined with sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome. Based on the non-contact millimeter-wave radar&#xD;
      equipment, a predictive model of acute exacerbation of COPD combined with sleep apnea&#xD;
      hypopnea syndrome was established to provide evidence for the clinical application of radar&#xD;
      equipment in the future.&#xD;
