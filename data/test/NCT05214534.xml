  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will investigate the relationship between the blood level of&#xD;
      SuPAR at admission to the emergency department of the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital,&#xD;
      and the outcome of patients after their hospitalization in a short stay unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SuPAR (Soluble urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor) is a non-specific prognostic blood&#xD;
      biomarker related to inflammation. An elevated SuPAR value reflects significant chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and predicts a risk of negative outcome and even short-term mortality&#xD;
      (intra-hospital, 30 days, 90 days). Conversely, a low SuPAR value is a strong indicator of&#xD;
      good prognosis and low risk of readmission. It is therefore of interest to know a patient's&#xD;
      SuPAR blood level to enable the clinician to decide whether the patient should be admitted or&#xD;
      discharged. SuPAR has been shown to be the best prognostic marker associated with the&#xD;
      presence and progression of disease and risk of mortality. The use of SuPAR in clinical&#xD;
      routine adds significant complementary information to the standard Early Warning Score&#xD;
      assessment and to the classical parameters such as CRP, PCT, Lactate, ALT, Bilirubin, and CBC&#xD;
      in the pre-admission of acute patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the emergency department will receive their usual management. We will&#xD;
      test the added value of the SuPAR assay in the prognosis of patients' outcome at discharge.&#xD;
