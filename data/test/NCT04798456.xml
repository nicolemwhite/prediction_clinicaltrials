  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improved treatment of severe brain injuries has resulted in increased survival rates. While&#xD;
      some of these patients regain consciousness after a transient state of coma, others may&#xD;
      develop a disorder of consciousness (DoC). Diagnosis of DoC currently relies on standardized&#xD;
      behavioral assessment. The importance of accuracy in such diagnosis cannot be overstated, as&#xD;
      it guides critical decisions on treatment (including pain management), and could underlie&#xD;
      end-of-life decisions. Despite this importance, current behavioral diagnosis often fails, if&#xD;
      because of the major sensory and motor deficits associated with DoC, or because of the&#xD;
      heterogeneous etiology and pathophysiology associated with the condition. Finally, the need&#xD;
      for accurate diagnosis and prognosis transcends the needs of the patients alone: caregiving&#xD;
      of these patients is very stressful, principally for the large uncertainty associated with&#xD;
      them. Thus, more accurate diagnosis and prognosis provide major relief for caregivers, and&#xD;
      paradoxically, even if the news is not &quot;good&quot;. For all these reasons it is critical to&#xD;
      developing personalized diagnosis and prognosis prediction tools that permit a stratified&#xD;
      analysis at the single-patient level. The PerBrain Project will benefit from the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary partners' expertise, and the unique opportunity to perform longitudinal&#xD;
      assessments in four clinical sites through both established and novel electrophysiological,&#xD;
      neuroimaging, and physiological techniques. Based on the collected data, the investigators&#xD;
      will develop a multimodal personalized diagnostic tool for DoC patients using&#xD;
      state-of-the-art computational tools, such as machine learning, in order to better determine&#xD;
      the current state (diagnosis) and future outcome (prognosis). The overall aim of this project&#xD;
      will provide for a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in DoC, which&#xD;
      will, in turn, allow personalized rehabilitation strategies, and improved single-patient&#xD;
      predictions of state and prognosis.&#xD;
