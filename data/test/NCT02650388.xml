      Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease among the adult population, in the&#xD;
      majority of the cases it only requires treatment in advanced age. Transcatheter aortic valve&#xD;
      implantation (TAVI) has become available as an alternative treatment for very high risk or&#xD;
      even inoperative patients who are suffering from symptomatic aortic stenosis. Until now it&#xD;
      has been learnt that there are group of patients who are in a very bad condition and who are&#xD;
      so frail that they do not benefit from TAVI. These patients have worse survival rate and more&#xD;
      importantly poor quality of life in spite of a successful procedure. Cardiac surgery risk&#xD;
      scores like Society of Thoracic surgery score (STS) and EUROSCORE are less accurate in aging&#xD;
      high risk people. In elderly it is principal to make differentiation between utility and&#xD;
      futility. On the other hand, beside frailty status the main barrier to TAVI is the risk of&#xD;
      neurological impairment. Neurological injury and impairment in TAVI can occur as&#xD;
      cerebrovascular event (CVE) and/or neurocognitive dysfunction. The two neurocognitive&#xD;
      dysfunctions - post-operative delirium (POD) and post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).&#xD;
      Most cases remain undetected although clinically could be apparent or silent. The&#xD;
      neurological injury can be observed and/or detected by neuroimaging techniques and cognitive&#xD;
      trajectories. A well established and validated frailty score based on relatively simple and&#xD;
      feasible tests could help in our everyday practice to evaluate the prognosis of elderly&#xD;
      people undergoing TAVI and to determine those patients who really benefit from the procedure.&#xD;

      Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease among the adult population, in the&#xD;
      majority of the cases it only requires treatment in advanced age. Surgical aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement (SAVR) is very often refused because of advanced age and poor general condition.&#xD;
      These patients used to receive only medical treatment which is less favorable compared to&#xD;
      SAVR. Nowadays transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become available as an&#xD;
      alternative treatment for very high risk or even inoperable patients who are suffering from&#xD;
      symptomatic aortic stenosis (1). Between 2012 and 2014 TAVI has been used extensively,&#xD;
      accumulating over 100,000 procedures performed worldwide since 2002 (2). TAVI was originally&#xD;
      developed for those patients who were considered too frail to undergo SAVR (3). Recently, we&#xD;
      are able to perform TAVI in almost all patients with high procedure success rate and achieve&#xD;
      good hemodynamic results. Despite these promising results, the one year outcome is not so&#xD;
      evident. Until now it has been learnt that there are a group of patients who are in a very&#xD;
      bad condition and who are so frail that they do not benefit from TAVI. These patients have&#xD;
      worse survival rate and more importantly poor quality of life in spite of a successful&#xD;
      procedure. Cardiac surgery risk scores like Society of Thoracic surgery score (STS) and&#xD;
      EUROSCORE are less accurate in aging high risk people (4). Advanced age is often accompanied&#xD;
      with frail general conditions and, the estimated morbidity and mortality values do not&#xD;
      correlate well with the postoperative outcomes. In these risk scores very important relevant&#xD;
      factors like frailty and disability are not taken into account. In elderly it is principal to&#xD;
      make differentiation between utility and futility. Frailty is a clinical syndrome that&#xD;
      reflects impaired physiologic reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors (5). However&#xD;
      frailty as a geriatric concept has existed for a long time, its importance has recently&#xD;
      gained high priority in the concept of older adults especially who undergo TAVI(1). By today&#xD;
      frailty scores have increasing importance and are used more frequently by several&#xD;
      investigators. Slow 5m gait speed has evidently proven unfavorable outcomes (6, 7), other&#xD;
      frailty assessment tools like handgrip strength test, activities of daily living (ADL),&#xD;
      instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), nutritional assessment, mini-mental status,&#xD;
      etc. has been being investigated continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, beside frailty status the main barrier to TAVI is the risk of neurological&#xD;
      impairment. The TAVI candidate patients have specific central nervous system (CNS) issues&#xD;
      because of neurobiological changes of aging, e.g. decreased brain weight and volume,&#xD;
      decreased neurotransmitter system function, decreased neuronal gene expression and Alzheimer&#xD;
      type changes (8). Neurological injury and impairment in TAVI can occur as cerebrovascular&#xD;
      event (CVE) and/or neurocognitive dysfunction. Both forms might be clinically apparent and&#xD;
      detected, clinically apparent but undetected and clinically silent and undetected. The two&#xD;
      neurocognitive dysfunctions - post-operative delirium (POD) and post-operative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction (POCD) - most cases remain undetected although clinically could be apparent or&#xD;
      silent (9). POD is defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth&#xD;
      Edition (DSM-5). POCD is defined by Kappetein et al., as &quot;deterioration of intellectual&#xD;
      function presenting as impaired memory or concentration presenting with temporal association&#xD;
      to surgery&quot; (9, 10). The neurological injury can be observed and/or detected by neuroimaging&#xD;
      techniques and cognitive trajectories. Some insult caused by TAVI might remain in the&#xD;
      clinically silent area and might be observed only as slight neurocognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
      Analization of the incidence and underlying etiology of the neurological events may lead to&#xD;
      identification of recently non-recognized techniques or neuroprotective strategies, devices.&#xD;
      The most elevated incidence of CVEs is within 24 hours of TAVI. This risk of further events&#xD;
      might be high for up to two months (11). One fifth of health-related quality of life (HRQOL)&#xD;
      is characterized by cognitive functions. Studies and reports on cognitive, psychiatric,&#xD;
      and/or neurological events following TAVI have focused on major and well-marked&#xD;
      complications, e.g., stroke, TIA, and post-operative delirium (12). Meantime TAVI is&#xD;
      associated with a high incidence (73%-84%) of silent cerebral embolism as detected by&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted MRI (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronological age does not always reflect biological age and there is a wide range between&#xD;
      fit to frail (14). A well established and validated frailty score based on relatively simple&#xD;
      and feasible tests could help in our everyday practice to evaluate the prognosis of elderly&#xD;
      people undergoing TAVI and to determine those patients who really benefit from the procedure.&#xD;
      Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) in patients undergoing TAVI (and/or SAVR) was&#xD;
      examined in only a few studies published during the last 10 years. Examinations and&#xD;
      investigation of finer, long-term and possibly positive post-operative cognitive outcomes&#xD;
      following TAVI (and SAVR) are significantly under-represented in the current medical&#xD;
      literature (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant correlation between the Hungarian Frailty Score (HFS) and post&#xD;
      procedure outcomes and quality of life preservation. HFS score would be a useful tool to&#xD;
      estimate those who will benefit from TAVI. We also hypothesize that cognitive performance&#xD;
      will be preserved, and will improve at the end of 12th month after TAVI due to better&#xD;
      cerebral circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Generate and validate a new risk score system called the Hungarian Frailty Score (HFS),&#xD;
           which represents an objective tool for evaluation of the frailty syndrome in patients&#xD;
           undergoing TAVI procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the changes and to prove that there is no cognitive decline in patients&#xD;
           undergoing TAVI if so any (pre and post TAVI cognitive function will be assessed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the correlation between the HFS, and the in-hospital stay, 30 day and 1-year&#xD;
      outcomes evaluated according to the VARC 2 Criteria. The benefit of this study is to conclude&#xD;
      exact data about quality of life and provide a comprehensive investigation of pre- and&#xD;
      post-TAVI cognitive outcomes. We plan to define that apart from the incidence of possible&#xD;
      neurological signs and the radiological evidences of neurogical injury and POCD, there is no&#xD;
      decline in long term cognitive functions and there is improvement in the long term quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Find correlation and differences between HFS, QoL, eyeball test, and cognitive outcomes.&#xD;
      Additional impact is to assess whether POD and POCD are a part of same condition, spectrum,&#xD;
      and what can we do to prevent them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To generate a simple and useable risk score system adopted to the Hungarian population for&#xD;
      evaluating patients who undergo TAVI and collect data about post TAVI QoL and cognitive&#xD;
      functions, and to register changes in the pre and post procedure frailty score. Non-diagnosed&#xD;
      preoperative cognitive impairments and CVEs of the patient will be detected at baseline.&#xD;
