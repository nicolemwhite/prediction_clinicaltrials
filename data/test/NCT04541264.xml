      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome(SI-ARDS) is a common complication of&#xD;
      severe sepsis and is an independent contributor to poor prognosis of patients. It remains a&#xD;
      clinical challenge to identify the SI-ARDS early and accurately, which could optimize the&#xD;
      treatment strategy and reduce the mortality risk. Radiomics high-dimensional features&#xD;
      extracted from CT images offer an insight into microvascular damage of SI-ARDS that are&#xD;
      imperceptible to human eyes and aspects of intra-alveolar heterogeneity with potential&#xD;
      prognostic relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Investigators screened all patients with sepsis and septic shock who are treated&#xD;
      in Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University during the period from 1 May 2015&#xD;
      and 30 May 2022. Patients were recruited retrospectively from May 2015 to April 2021 as&#xD;
      discovering group, and prospectively during the period from May 2021 to May 2022 as&#xD;
      validation group. Follow-up will conducted until April 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort descriptions and definitions Investigators plan to recruit 160 patients in discovering&#xD;
      group, 40 patients in internal validation group, and 100 patients in external validation&#xD;
      group. Patients between 18 and 80 years of age with sepsis and septic shock will be screened&#xD;
      for eligibility. SI-ARDS is defined by sequential occurrence of the sepsis-3 consensus&#xD;
      criteria for sepsis and the Berlin Definition for ARDS. The exclusion criteria are：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. admission stay &lt;24hours,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the presence of end-stage lung disease or long-term oxygen therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. critically ill patients who have started mechanical ventilation caused by SI-ARDS before&#xD;
           admission,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. a history of lung transplantation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. cancer patients not/have received chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures In this study, the primary outcome measure was the occurrence rates of acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS). It refers to the occurrence of sepsis patients&#xD;
      progressed into ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.28-day mortality 2.ventilator-free days 3.respiratory failure-free days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection All clinical data were collected by investigators and trained personnel. Each&#xD;
      participant's data will be filled in electronic case report forms (CRF) and store online&#xD;
      using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SI-ARDS is one common severe complication with critically ill sepsis patients, which causes&#xD;
      high mortality and poor prognosis. Early ARDS patient(arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen&#xD;
      fraction [PaO2/FIO2] ≤ 300 mmHg but &gt; 200 mmHg) may not require invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, and is more readily reversible than acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS).&#xD;
      In this ambispecive cohort study, investigators developed and validated novel nomograms&#xD;
      incorporating the radiomics signature and clinical signature to provide an easy-to-use and&#xD;
      individualized prediction of SI-ARDS occurrence and severe degree in patients with early&#xD;
      stage.&#xD;
