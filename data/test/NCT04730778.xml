    <textblock>
      Contrast induced acute kidney injury has commonly been referred to as contrast induced&#xD;
      nephropathy (CIN) defined as an increase in serum creatinine ≥25% or ≥0.5 mg/dl from baseline&#xD;
      within 48-72 hours with peak incidence 2-5 days after contrast exposure.1. CIN, Which can&#xD;
      potentially lead to acute kidney failure or mortality, is still common among hospitalized&#xD;
      patients. In addition, contrast medium exposure may lead to long-term outcomes such as&#xD;
      dialysis-requiring renal failure or death.2. The incidence of CIN ranges from 7% to 25% in&#xD;
      different population subgroups based on the risk status. Hence, risk stratification has an&#xD;
      important bearing in order to provide the appropriate preventive therapies to those high-risk&#xD;
      individuals before and after contrast media exposure.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, several risk prediction models have been proposed to envisage the CIN incidence.&#xD;
      Mehran proposed a scoring system comprising eight variables which correlated well with the&#xD;
      CIN risk. Despite having a fair degree of accuracy; complexity was one of the major&#xD;
      limitations of such models.4 .Most predictive models for contrast induced nephropathy in&#xD;
      clinical use have modest ability, and are only applied to patients receiving contrast for&#xD;
      coronary angiography. Further research is needed to develop models that can better inform&#xD;
      patient centered decision making, as well as improve the use of preventive strategies for&#xD;
      contrast induced nephropathy.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a clinical syndrome defined by characteristic&#xD;
      symptoms of myocardial ischemia in association with persistent electrocardiographic ST&#xD;
      elevation (STE) and subsequent release of biomarkers of myocardial necrosis.1 STE is the&#xD;
      single best immediately available surrogate marker for detecting acute complete coronary&#xD;
      artery occlusion, denoting a significant region of injured myocardium at imminent risk of&#xD;
      irreversible infarction, requiring immediate reperfusion therapy.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) if performed in a timely fashion is the&#xD;
      recommended modality of reperfusion in STEMI cases as per guidelines [ACC-ESC-STEMI &amp;&#xD;
      revascularization]. Frequently, baseline kidney functions are unknown, nevertheless, to&#xD;
      maximize salvaging myocardial tissue for STEMI patients; immediate reperfusion is prioritized&#xD;
      over awaiting tests results. Considering the systemic inflammatory response associated with&#xD;
      STEMI and that commonly due to severe pain and agony, those patients are not properly&#xD;
      hydrated, added to higher prevalence of MI-related myocardial dysfunction and heart failure&#xD;
      than in elective cases, primary PCI for STEMI cases might have higher risk than usual of&#xD;
      CIN.7,8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHA2DS2-VASC score is traditionally used for embolic risk stratification in atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF) patients and includes the following variables: congestive heart failure&#xD;
      (CHF), hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus (DM), previous stroke, vascular&#xD;
      disease, age 65 to 74 years and sex.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHA2DS2-VASC score has been reported recently to have a prognostic utility to predict&#xD;
      adverse clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), regardless of&#xD;
      having AF.10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHA2DS2VASC score is practical and easy to memorize and apply in STEMI cases, however,&#xD;
      strong evidence to validate its prognostic value in predicting CIN in the setting acute STEMI&#xD;
      is lacking.&#xD;

      - Methodology in details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction who meets the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Full history taking: including age, sex, history of DM, HTN, Smoking, dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      history of cerebrovascular stroke, family history of renal problems as well as time of onset&#xD;
      of chest pain and time to reperfusion. Regular medications and any nephrotoxic administration&#xD;
      within the prior week to the index event will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Targeted physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General examination and cardiac examination to detect signs of heart failure and/or&#xD;
           signs suggestive of mechanical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C. Twelve lead ECG: To diagnose ST elevation myocardial infarction, Diagnostic STE is&#xD;
           defined as new STE at the J point in at least 2 contiguous leads ≥ 2 mm (0.2 mV) in men&#xD;
           or ≥ 1.5 mm (0.15 mV) in women in leads V2-V3 and/or of ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in other&#xD;
           contiguous chest or limb leads.3 The presence of reciprocal changes (manifested as ST&#xD;
           depression in a region that approximates the vector 180 degrees opposite the major&#xD;
           vessel of injury) increases the specificity of STE caused by STEMI.4 .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D. Collecting baseline venous blood samples for Random blood glucose, Hemoglobin, serum&#xD;
           creatinine and GFR, before the procedure. to be noted that reperfusion by primary PCI&#xD;
           will not await tests results to be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Coronary angiography and primary PCI will be done by the interventional cardiologist as&#xD;
      per standard technique. After the procedure the volume of used contrast agent will be&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Echocardiography: will be performed within 48 hours after the primary PCI to assess&#xD;
      systolic, diastolic and valvular functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Follow up of serum creatinine 12 hours after the procedure then daily till time of&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. CHA2DS2-VASC score will be calculated for each patient. Based on the CHA2DS2-VASC score,&#xD;
      patients are given 1 point foreach of the following risk factors : CHF, hypertension, age 65&#xD;
      to 74 years, diabetes mellitus, vascular disease and female gender and 2 points for age 75&#xD;
      years or older and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Mehran risk score will be also calculated, that risk score includes 8 prognostic&#xD;
      variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hypotension (5 points, if systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mmHg for at least 1 hour requiring&#xD;
           inotropic support),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of intra-aortic balloon pump (5 points),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHF (5 points, if class III/IV by New York Heart Association Classification or history&#xD;
           of pulmonary edema),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age (4 points, if &gt;75 years),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anemia (3 points, if hematocrit &lt;39% for men and &lt;36 for women),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diabetes mellitus (3 points ),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  contrast media volume (1 point per 100 ml),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  estimated GFR 2 points, if GFR 60 to 40 ml/min per 1.73 m2; 4 points, if GFR 40 to 20; 6&#xD;
           points, if GFR &lt;20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four categories of CIN risk of were established from the cut-off points and intervals defined&#xD;
      by Mehran et al. 2010 as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Low, &lt;5 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate, 6 to 10 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. High, 11 to 15 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Very high, &gt;15 points. Patients who develop CIN will have their characteristics studied&#xD;
           as well as their CHA2DS2VASC score , MEHRAN score and their individual components to be&#xD;
           compared to those who did not develop primary PCI related CIN.&#xD;
