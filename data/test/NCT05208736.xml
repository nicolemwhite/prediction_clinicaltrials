  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis, as the end stage of most chronic liver diseases, is an important clinical landmark&#xD;
      portending high risk of death. Early identification and accurate prognostic scores is&#xD;
      critical issue to improve survival rate. Loss of muscle mass and other body features, which&#xD;
      can be determined from CT, have been associated with mortality in cirrhosis or hepatic&#xD;
      carcinoma. In this study, we sought to investigate serial changes of CT imaging parameters,&#xD;
      such as the skeletal muscle index (SMI), liver volume, adiposity density and so forth, to&#xD;
      develop a new prognostic model for long-term motality in patients with liver cirrhosis. The&#xD;
      final predictive model was developed under the Cox regression framework with MELD, Child-Pugh&#xD;
      score, baseline and serial changes of CT imaging parameters. The discrimination of the new&#xD;
      risk score was assessed by the overall C index.&#xD;

      Cirrosis, which is always manifesting as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding, severe jaundice and coagulopathy, deteriorates rapidly with a high&#xD;
      mortality. Early identification and accurate predicted model may be the key to make duly&#xD;
      clinical decision and improve prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When hepatic disorders accur, cirrhosis is often accompanied by varying degrees of&#xD;
      malnutrition, which is accurately reflexed by the cross-sectioned areas of the muscles at the&#xD;
      third lumbar vertebra level normalized by the square of the height （L3-SMI）. In addition,&#xD;
      previous studies have shown that lower density of adiposity and altered liver volume were&#xD;
      often associated with adverse clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes in body composition can be accurately assessed and measured by using CT scans.&#xD;
      However, there is no ideas whether these imaging patameters are reliable indicators to&#xD;
      predict the mortality of cirrhosis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the difference of&#xD;
      serial changes of L3-SMI, the density of adiposity and liver volume between 5-year survival&#xD;
      and non-survival group and develop a new prognostic model based on these CT imaging data.&#xD;
      This study highlighted the clinical significance of serial changes of CT imaging data in&#xD;
      predicting the long-term outcome of patients with cirrhosis for the first time.&#xD;

        All the patients were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis who met with the inclusion criteria&#xD;
        and exclusion criteria. Two cohorts of subjects were enrolled in several liver centers. In&#xD;
        the modeling cohort, subjects were identified retrospectively from patients with liver&#xD;
        ciirhosis, referred from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2020. In the validation cohort,&#xD;
        subjects were enrolled from external liver centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, healthy volunteers who had normal liver function and normal BMI were recruited&#xD;
        and acted as controls.&#xD;
