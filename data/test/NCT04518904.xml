  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary contusion caused by severe thoracic trauma is a complex disease. Some patients may&#xD;
      be secondary to severe complications such as pulmonary infection or even acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome. At present, there have been no reports on related studies based on Chinese&#xD;
      population. In this study, 800 patients with pulmonary contusion will be retrospectively&#xD;
      investigated to determine the risk factors and independent risk factors of their poor&#xD;
      prognosis, and to construct a prognosis prediction model and scoring criteria.&#xD;
