      This phase 2, open-label, dual-center, two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigates&#xD;
      the effects of 16 weeks of structured aerobic training, relative to usual care (print&#xD;
      material with physical activity guidance). Prostate genomic signatures represent the&#xD;
      functional activity of all genes in the genome and are converted into genomic risk scores&#xD;
      which correspond to the probability of a progression event (chance of having more aggressive&#xD;
      disease). A structured exercise program may alter the genomic risk score and improve&#xD;
      prediction of aggressive disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the effect of remotely monitored, tailored aerobic training, compared to usual&#xD;
      care (print material with physical activity guidance), on cardiopulmonary fitness in men on&#xD;
      active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of aerobic training, compared with usual care, on prostate genomic&#xD;
      signatures that predict risk of prostate cancer progression or aggressive disease; and&#xD;
      messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression patterns in tumor and surrounding stromal&#xD;
      (normal) tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of aerobic training, compared with usual care, on&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes including active surveillance-specific anxiety, stress, &amp;&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To procure blood, urine and paraffin embedded prostate tissue for future exploratory&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To conduct correlative science examining associations between measures of cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      fitness, clinical features, and biomarkers of prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate and compare circulating and urinary biomarkers (e.g., metabolomics,&#xD;
      proteomics) among men in Arms A, B, and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This study is a randomized controlled trial of 16-weeks aerobic exercise (home-based&#xD;
      walking) versus (vs.) usual care among 64 men with prostate cancer on active surveillance.&#xD;
      There is also a non-randomized observational component to the study where we will collect&#xD;
      biospecimens, survey, data, and administer one cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo structured aerobic training comprising four treadmill walking&#xD;
      sessions a week at 55% to 75% of the individually determined exercise capacity for 16 weeks.&#xD;
      Men are provided with a heart rate monitor to help ensure they exercise in their target zone.&#xD;
      At baseline &amp; week 16 (-7, +7 days), all patients complete: (1) lifestyle and quality-of-life&#xD;
      questionnaires, (2) measurement of weight and waist circumference (3) collection of research&#xD;
      fasting blood sample, (4) transrectal ultrasound-guided clinical biopsy, and (5)&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness testing. Archival tissue specimens from standard of care biopsies&#xD;
      are also collected, pre/post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (USUAL CARE): Patients undergo usual care and are provided with general physical&#xD;
      activity information (&quot;Moving through Cancer-A Guide to Exercise for Cancer Survivors&quot;) at&#xD;
      baseline. At the conclusion of the 16 weeks, subjects in this group will be provided with a&#xD;
      free session with an exercise physiologist and an individualized aerobic exercise program&#xD;
      based on their cardiorespiratory fitness test results. Archival tissue specimens from&#xD;
      standard of care biopsies are also collected, pre/post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C (NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROL GROUP): Control group of men without cancer, with a lower&#xD;
      baseline fitness level (assessed as part of screening), who will receive all baseline and 16&#xD;
      week follow-up assessments (except tissue procurement), and the same intervention as Arm A.&#xD;
      Subjects undergo structured aerobic training comprising four treadmill walking sessions a&#xD;
      week at 55% to 75% of the individually determined exercise capacity for 16 weeks. Men are&#xD;
      provided with a heart rate monitor to help ensure they exercise in their target zone. At&#xD;
      baseline &amp; week 16 (-7, +7 days), all patients complete: (1) lifestyle and quality-of-life&#xD;
      questionnaires, (2) measurement of weight and waist circumference (3) collection of research&#xD;
      fasting blood sample, (4) cardiorespiratory fitness testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBSERVATIONAL GROUP (NON-RANDOMIZED): Biospecimens, survey, data, and administer one CPET&#xD;
      will be collected. Individuals who will be enrolled to this group include those who do not&#xD;
      meet all eligibility criteria for the RCT, or those who do not wish to be in a RCT, but are&#xD;
      interested to participate in some lifestyle research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients in Arms A &amp; B are followed up at 16 weeks, 12 months, and&#xD;
      24 months. Non-randomized participants (Arm C) are followed-up at 16 weeks, and Observational&#xD;
      study participants are asked to complete surveys at 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
