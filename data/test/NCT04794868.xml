  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and sudden cardiac death can be the first manifestation of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and are the leading cause of death in the majority of the world's&#xD;
      population. The main pathophysiology of ACS is well-known and fibrous cap thickness, presence&#xD;
      of a lipid core, and the degree of inflammation have been proposed as the key determinants of&#xD;
      plaque vulnerability. Previous studies using virtual histology intravascular ultrasound or&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography showed that clinical application of this concept improved risk&#xD;
      prediction of ACS. However, these approaches have not been widely adopted in daily practice&#xD;
      due to relatively low positive predictive values, low prevalence of high-risk plaques and the&#xD;
      invasive nature of diagnostic modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive imaging studies with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) also showed&#xD;
      the clinical value of CCTA-derived high risk plaque characteristics (HRPC). In addition, the&#xD;
      recent progress in CCTA and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technologies enables&#xD;
      simultaneous assessment of anatomical lesion severity, presence of HRPC and quantification of&#xD;
      hemodynamic forces acting on plaques in patient-specific geometric models. As plaque rupture&#xD;
      is a complicated biomechanical process influenced by the structure and constituents of the&#xD;
      plaque as well as the external mechanical and hemodynamic forces acting on the plaque, a&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation of lesion geometry, plaque characteristics and hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters may enhance the identification of high-risk plaque and the prediction of ACS risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, the current study is designed to evaluate prognostic implications of&#xD;
      comprehensive non-invasive hemodynamic assessment using CCTA and CFD in the identification of&#xD;
      high risk plaques that caused subsequent ACS.&#xD;

      The study population was collected from Samsung Medical Center. Target population is patients&#xD;
      who suffered a clearly documented ACS (acute myocardial infarction [MI] or unstable angina&#xD;
      with objective evidence of plaque rupture) or those who underwent significant lesion&#xD;
      progression in angiography and treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and had&#xD;
      undergone CCTA from 6 months to 3 years prior to the coronary events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CCTA images were screened for plaque characteristics and CFD analysis at core laboratories in&#xD;
      Elucid Bioimaging, Inc, MA, USA and Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Shanghai,&#xD;
      China, respectively. Lesions with diameter stenosis (DS) &gt; 30% based on CCTA evaluation were&#xD;
      included analysis. The presence of conventional CCTA-HRPC (minimum lumen area&lt;&lt;4 mm2, plaque&#xD;
      burden≥70%, low-attenuation plaque, positive remodeling, napkin-ring sign, and spotty&#xD;
      calcification) and parameters from tissue characterization using VascuCAP software will be&#xD;
      assessed in each lesion by an independent observer blinded to the clinical data and CFD&#xD;
      results. The hemodynamic parameters from CFD will include 1) per-vessel FFR derived from CCTA&#xD;
      (FFRCT); 2) change in FFRCT across the lesion (△FFRCT); 3) FFRCT pullback pressure gradient&#xD;
      (PPG) index (FFRCT-PPG index); 4) Fractional myocardial mass (FMM) of the target stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the occurrence of ACS or PCI for the progressed lesion as clinical endpoint, prognostic&#xD;
      implications of CCTA-derived HRPC or hemodynamic parameters will be analyzed.&#xD;
