    <textblock>
      This study is to build a Xinjiang people registry and surveillance system for acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction(AMI) information about patient's basic information, patient&#xD;
      characteristics, diagnostic test mode, the program of treatment and hospitalization outcomes&#xD;
      including mortality, treatment complications, the cost of hospitalization and follow-up&#xD;
      events (death, major adverse cardiac events, stroke, heart failure) of AMI patients; And to&#xD;
      propose scientific precaution strategies aimed to prevent effectively from the incidence of&#xD;
      AMI; And to optimize the management and outcomes of AMI patients through implementation of&#xD;
      guideline recommendations in clinical practice, and to perform analyses and development of&#xD;
      effective treatment strategies and predictive models of clinical ourtcomes.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to establish the platform for surveillance, clinical research and&#xD;
      translational medicine in Xinjiang , designed to provide a foundation for future quality&#xD;
      improvement and research as well as facilitate efforts to improve the quality of AMI patient&#xD;
      care , translate research into improved care for patients and thus decrease morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality associated with AMI.&#xD;
