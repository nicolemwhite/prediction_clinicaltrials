      The purpose of the study is to explore the value which cough rate might provide for asthma&#xD;
      self-management. In this study, the focus will be specifically on nocturnal cough rate. The&#xD;
      plan is to use a longitudinal study design, in order to investigate to which extent trends in&#xD;
      the nocturnal cough rates might have meaningful implications for future asthma control and&#xD;
      asthma exacerbations of patients. The incidence of nocturnal cough in asthmatics will be&#xD;
      described and visualized over the course of one month in the first stage of the study.&#xD;
      Additionally, the aim will be to identify and model trends in nocturnal cough rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring cough is very time-consuming. Currently, there are no cough frequency monitors&#xD;
      available, which measure cough rates in a fully automated and unobtrusive way. Consequently,&#xD;
      manual labeling of cough based on video or sound recordings is still considered to be the&#xD;
      gold standard for measuring cough rates by medical guidelines. Recently, a machine learning&#xD;
      algorithm was successfully designed to automatically detect cough in a proof of concept&#xD;
      study. This machine learning algorithm will be further developed in order to provide robust&#xD;
      results in the field. The focus of this study will be the cough during the night time due to&#xD;
      the limited interfering noise, which greatly facilitates manual labeling and enables a more&#xD;
      reliable detection rate of the machine learning algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from developing a machine learning algorithm for cough detection, data will be gathered&#xD;
      for the assessment of patient's sleep quality based on data obtained from smartphone's&#xD;
      sensors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease, belongs to the most prevalent chronic conditions. In&#xD;
      Switzerland, 7-15% of all children and 6-7% of all adults suffer from it. Common symptoms are&#xD;
      breathlessness, coughing and wheezing. The symptoms often get worse at night and often cause&#xD;
      awakenings. Cough is a particularly important symptom in asthma because it predicts asthma&#xD;
      severity, indicates a worse prognosis and is perceived to be a troublesome symptom.&#xD;
      Additionally, asthma is the leading cause for chronic cough, responsible for 24-29% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, little is known about the utility of cough tracking for self-monitoring purposes in&#xD;
      asthmatics. A first cross-sectional study has indicated that the cough rate during both day&#xD;
      and night might be a valid marker for asthma control, rendering it a potentially useful&#xD;
      parameter for self-monitoring. Unfortunately, due to considerable variance of cough rates&#xD;
      within each category of asthma control (i.e. uncontrolled, partially controlled and&#xD;
      controlled asthma), the statistically significant relationship between cough rate and asthma&#xD;
      control might not be clinically meaningful. Additionally, due to the cross-sectional design&#xD;
      of existing studies, it remains unclear whether the cough rate might have any prognostic&#xD;
      value for predicting future asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the value which cough rate might provide&#xD;
      for asthma self-management in more detail. In This study, the focus will be put specifically&#xD;
      on nocturnal cough rate due to the technical reasons. In general, the plan of this study is&#xD;
      as follows: With a longitudinal study design, it is possible to investigate to which extent&#xD;
      trends in the nocturnal cough rates might have meaningful implications for future asthma&#xD;
      control and asthma exacerbations of patients. However, in order to analyze the predictive&#xD;
      value of trends in nocturnal cough rate, the symptom has to persist over multiple nights.&#xD;
      There is no research available on the prevalence of nocturnal cough in asthmatics over&#xD;
      multiple nights. Therefore, the incidence of nocturnal cough in asthmatics will be described&#xD;
      and visualized over the course of one month in the first stage of our study. Additionally,&#xD;
      the aim will be to identify and model trends in nocturnal cough rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring cough is very time-consuming. Currently, there are no cough frequency monitors&#xD;
      available, which measure cough rates in a fully automated and unobtrusive way. Consequently,&#xD;
      manual labeling of cough based on video or sound recordings is still considered to be the&#xD;
      gold standard for measuring cough rates by medical guidelines. Nevertheless, a machine&#xD;
      learning algorithm has been successfully designed to automatically detect cough in a proof of&#xD;
      concept study. Despite using only very limited data for algorithm development (80 coughs from&#xD;
      5 healthy subjects), the accuracy reached 83%. However, the data were gathered in a&#xD;
      laboratory setting, which limits the generalizability of the results and thus applicability&#xD;
      in practice. Therefore, the aim is to develop a machine learning algorithm which is also&#xD;
      capable to provide robust results in the field. This study will focus on cough during the&#xD;
      night time due to the limited interfering noise, which greatly facilitates manual labeling&#xD;
      and enables a more reliable detection rate of the machine learning algorithm. It is important&#xD;
      to point out that the analysis of nocturnal cough prevalence described above will not be&#xD;
      based on cough detected by an algorithm, but on the manually labeled coughs in the audio&#xD;
      track recorded during the night by a study smartphone, which will be provided to subjects for&#xD;
      the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from developing a machine learning algorithm for cough detection, data will be gathered&#xD;
      for an algorithm assessing patient's sleep quality. For this purpose, sleep quality will be&#xD;
      predicted based on data obtained from the smartphone's sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After concluding the first study stage, the prevalence of nocturnal cough in the study will&#xD;
      determine whether further analyses of the recorded data will be needed and thereby initiate&#xD;
      the second stage of the study. If nocturnal cough does not occur more frequently than could&#xD;
      be explained by chance alone, no additional analysis will be conducted implying that the&#xD;
      conclusion of the first stage and the end of the project. However, given a sufficient&#xD;
      prevalence of nocturnal cough in the first stage (i.e. nocturnal cough prevalence differs&#xD;
      from zero with statistical significance); the second stage of the study will focus on the&#xD;
      value of nocturnal cough as a prognostic marker for asthma control. The considerable variance&#xD;
      within categories of asthma control shown in suggests that the relationship between nocturnal&#xD;
      cough rate and asthma control might be moderated by other variables. Prior research has&#xD;
      demonstrated that sleep quality is associated with asthma control and quality of life: Even&#xD;
      if accounted for concomitant diseases (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease and obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea), poorer sleep quality is associated with worse asthma control and quality of&#xD;
      life. One reason for the association between sleep quality and asthma control might be that&#xD;
      nocturnal asthma symptoms frequently cause awakenings. Considering the importance of sleep&#xD;
      quality for asthma control, the (predictive) value of the nocturnal cough rate and its&#xD;
      influence on sleep quality will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the following asthma-related research question will be explored within each stage&#xD;
      of this study: (1) what is the prevalence of nocturnal cough in asthmatics over the course of&#xD;
      one month? (2) Is nocturnal cough, accounted for sleep quality, a valid prognostic marker for&#xD;
      asthma control? Additionally, the study addresses two technical objectives: gather data to&#xD;
      develop two machine learning algorithms, which are able to detect nocturnal cough and sleep&#xD;
      quality fully automated by means of a smartphone in real-life conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answering these research questions results in multiple contributions: in terms of&#xD;
      asthma-related questions, the hope will be to provide context on the symptom of nocturnal&#xD;
      cough in order to increase interpretability of cough rates and to successfully replicate and&#xD;
      expand the findings of, which would support the validity of nocturnal cough as a (prognostic)&#xD;
      marker for asthma control. In terms of technical objectives, the hope will be to provide a&#xD;
      proof of concept that smartphones are suitable devices for sensing asthma symptoms in an&#xD;
      automated fashion under real-life conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results could enable a novel therapeutic option, namely fully automated&#xD;
      tele-monitoring of asthmatics. Using the smartphone of a patient, an unobtrusive early&#xD;
      warning system for asthma worsening/exacerbations could be envisioned. Such an system could&#xD;
      lower the burden of asthma for both the individual patient (e.g. higher quality of life and&#xD;
      asthma control by identifying windows of opportunity, in which patients can change their&#xD;
      medication according to their asthma action plan to prevent asthma worsening and&#xD;
      exacerbations) as well as the healthcare system (i.e. cost savings due to reduced&#xD;
      hospitalizations and emergency room visits). Considering the wide spread availability of&#xD;
      smartphones, such a novel therapeutic option might enable large scale and cost-efficient&#xD;
      asthma tele-monitoring. Prior research has indicated the need for such a novel therapeutic&#xD;
      option: the majority of asthmatics suffers from uncontrolled asthma. Half of asthmatics are&#xD;
      not able to assess their symptom severity properly and would thus benefit from an early&#xD;
      warning system. Additionally, automated systems seem to have a higher long term engagement&#xD;
      compared to traditional interventions, making them particularly suitable for early warning&#xD;
      systems in chronic diseases. Furthermore, tele-monitoring of symptoms could provide&#xD;
      physicians with valuable insights regarding a patient's asthma symptoms between visits. In&#xD;
      summary, an automated early warning system might help patients register asthma worsening&#xD;
      earlier and inform their physicians in time, so that adverse health consequences can be&#xD;
      prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned study falls into the risk category of health related personal data collection&#xD;
      with only minimal risk and burdens. It is a prospective observational study, no intervention&#xD;
      will be administered. Only a slight and temporary impact on the participant's health can be&#xD;
      expected, if at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, a patient's asthma symptoms will be monitored unobtrusively using the&#xD;
      smartphone; thus, minimal risk and burdens are ensured. Between both doctoral visits at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the study, all control questions and questionnaires will be administered&#xD;
      via smartphones that we will provide for this study. Thus, the burden should be minimal for&#xD;
      patients as their daily routine will not be disrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No invasive procedure will be conducted in the two doctoral visits. The medical examination&#xD;
      follows the standard protocol for asthma. Additionally, patients will be reimbursed for any&#xD;
      inconveniences encountered during the study.&#xD;
