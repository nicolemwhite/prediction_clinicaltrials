  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep quality affect working and learning performance; poor quality of sleep is one of the&#xD;
      common problems of modern people. Traditionally, polysomnography is a recognized standard for&#xD;
      sleep quality assessment. Subjects are put adhesive electrodes, chest and abdomen band,&#xD;
      oximetery, and oronasal cannula and stay in certified sleep laboratory for monitoring. These&#xD;
      sensors setup are cumbersome and be likely to induce discomfort. An alternative to assess the&#xD;
      quality of sleep is actigraphy, which allows users to wear for more than two weeks. In recent&#xD;
      years, many of the smart watches, which often measure wrist photoplethysmography (PPG) signal&#xD;
      and body movement, are prevailing to make long-term sleep monitoring feasible, but its&#xD;
      accuracy and effectiveness still need to be verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by intermittent hypoxia and&#xD;
      sleep fragmentation. OSA is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, metabolic&#xD;
      dysregulation, and neurocognitive dysfunction, which results in the negative impact on&#xD;
      prognosis. PSG is the gold standard for OSA diagnosis which is expensive and less accessible.&#xD;
      Therefore, modality other than PSG is necessary to speed up diagnosis and treatment. Center&#xD;
      of Sleep Disorder in National Taiwan University Hospital has been operated since June 2006.&#xD;
      Up to Dec.2015, totally 8,819 patients have been referred for sleep studies (NTUH cohort)&#xD;
      where 1,435 patients are under long-term CPAP and 396 patients are under MAD. Using data from&#xD;
      4,618 patients in NTUH cohort, we have already established an OSA prediction mode&#xD;
      (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI≥5/hr) with accuracy 82.37% (sensitivity 87.03%, positive&#xD;
      predictive value 91%). Regarding the molecular mechanism, our previous study showed that by&#xD;
      plasma metabolomics profiling, we could identify candidate metabolites associated with OSA&#xD;
      severity. The 11 candidate metabolites were identified by comparing profiling in 100 patients&#xD;
      with AHI &lt;15/hr and with AHI&gt;=15/hr, respectively. Six identified metabolites were selected&#xD;
      to establish an AHI prediction model which gave sensitivity 66%, specificity 72%, and AUROC&#xD;
      0.736. Furthermore, 15 plasma metabolites associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)&#xD;
      or polysomnographic parameters were identified. Among those metabolites, L-Kynurenine and&#xD;
      g-Glutamylleucine were metabolites associated with EDS which generated the AUROC to EDS&#xD;
      prediction as 63% in study group and 76.7% in validation group. The online system (Good&#xD;
      Sleep) for diagnosis of sleep disorder has been set up under the collaboration between, NTU,&#xD;
      NTUH, and MediaTek. It aims on population with low probability of sleep disorder which&#xD;
      compliments the NTUH cohort, high probability of sleep disorder. The online system provides&#xD;
      the diagnosis and solution of sleep disorder, sleep tracking, and education via both website&#xD;
      and App. The system is almost set and needs the input from general population to validate the&#xD;
      accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sleep healthcare system, which includes questionnaires, smart watches,24-hr BP and&#xD;
      &quot;LARGAN&quot;ECG Holter for long-term home sleep monitoring, is proposed to allow users to detect&#xD;
      potential subjects who have sleep disorders by filling out the questionnaire. The aims of the&#xD;
      present project include: (1) All 300 voluntary.Stage1, Recruit 140 voluntary participants&#xD;
      from MediaTek to validate agreement of sleep efficiency via online system, actigraph devices,&#xD;
      smart watches and daily blood pressure for one week.Stage2, Recruit 160 voluntary&#xD;
      participants from patients with moderate-severe OSA (AHI≥15/hr) to validate agreement of&#xD;
      sleep efficiency via online system, actigraph devices, smart watches, ECG Holter and 24 hour&#xD;
      blood pressure for one day. (2) All participants will take an overnight PSG test, blood&#xD;
      sampling, basal metabolism measurement, ECG Holter, body composition and E-Prime at the sleep&#xD;
      center to validate the performance of online system on diagnosis of OSA in low risk&#xD;
      population. (3) Analyze the of PSG parameters in both low and high risk population (to build&#xD;
      up the out of center devices for OSA home testing). (4) Integrate the clinical parameters and&#xD;
      plasma metabolic profile, before and after treatment, to identify factors associated with OSA&#xD;
      related sequels and long-term prognosis.&#xD;
