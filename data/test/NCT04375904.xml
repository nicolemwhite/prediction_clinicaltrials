    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, non-randomised study examining the safety of treating high risk centrally&#xD;
      located non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours and single pulmonary oligometastatic&#xD;
      lesions using radiation therapy (RT), for patients whose disease is inoperable. The method of&#xD;
      delivering the RT in this study is image guided stereotactic ablative radiation therapy&#xD;
      (IG-SABR). This method involves using imaging to ensure the radiation is being delivered to&#xD;
      the correct location within the body and using higher than normal doses per treatment&#xD;
      (fraction) to treat the lung cancer (NSCLC)/oligometastatic lung lesion. This study aims to&#xD;
      determine its safety by looking at the number and severity of side effects. This study will&#xD;
      deliver 8 treatments/fractions of RT with 7.5 Gy delivered in each fraction. To be eligible&#xD;
      for this study the initial treatment plan for the patient must be shown to not fulfil certain&#xD;
      criteria relating to doses to the tumour and surrounding normal tissue. This study has its&#xD;
      own study specific criteria which must be adhered to. Translational sub-studies (optional)&#xD;
      are open to patients in participating centres only. Patients will have the option to consent&#xD;
      to participating in both translational studies or to neither.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II non-randomised, multi-centre, single arm trial of image-guided&#xD;
      (IG)-SABR for high-risk centrally located T1-T4 lung tumours (NSCLC) and single pulmonary&#xD;
      oligometastatic lesions. Treatment will consist of IG-SABR using a total of 8 fractions of&#xD;
      7.5 Gy per fraction adhering to organ at risk dose-volume histogram constraints allowing a&#xD;
      minimum dose coverage of 75% to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) coverage, and a&#xD;
      minimum dose of 87% to 99% of the gross tumour volume (GTV), using dose intensity modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to determine the safety of the 8 x 7.5 Gy treatment regimen&#xD;
      on the basis of the rate of ≥ Grade 3 treatment related toxicity using NCI CTCAE V5, in&#xD;
      patients with medically inoperable early stage, ultracentrally located lung tumours. This is&#xD;
      defined by central tumours which are not fulfilling the conservative hybrid DVCs of the&#xD;
      LungTech (Adebahr et al., 2015), RTOG 0813 (Bezjak et al., 2015) studies and UK consortium&#xD;
      guidelines (v6.1 2019) with full dose coverage, but which subsequently meet SOURCE DVC's with&#xD;
      potentially reduced dose coverage. Toxicities occurring between start of treatment and&#xD;
      one-year from the end of treatment, which are possibly, probably or definitely related to&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 evaluable patients will be required for the study. The sample size was&#xD;
      calculated using continuous monitoring for toxicity, up to one year post RT, using a&#xD;
      Pocock-type boundary. Accrual will be halted if excessive numbers of ≥ Grade 3 TxR-AEs are&#xD;
      seen. The regime will not be considered to be safe if &gt;25% of evaluable patients experience a&#xD;
      ≥ Grade 3 treatment-related adverse event (TxR-AE) by the end of 1-year post-RT. This study&#xD;
      will be considered adequately safe if ≤ 25% of evaluable patients experience ≥ Grade 3 TxR-AE&#xD;
      by the end of 1 year post-RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolment period is expected to be 3-3.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity assessments will be carried out weekly during radiotherapy (RT), at 2, 4 and 8-weeks&#xD;
      post-treatment and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months post treatment and annually thereafter to 5&#xD;
      years post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational Sub-Study 1 (Raman spectroscopic analysis) - Primary aim is to undertake&#xD;
      biomarker discovery using label-free Raman spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical&#xD;
      methods to identify spectral biomarkers that could:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Predict response based on individual radiation sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Monitor response based on individual radiation sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational Sub-Study 2 (Proteomic analysis) - Primary aim is to use proteomic analysis of&#xD;
      sequential blood samples before, during and after treatment to detect changes in protein&#xD;
      expression profiles that may predict outcome and identify prognostic biochemical markers of&#xD;
      early toxicity.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase II non-randomised, multi-centre, single arm trial assessing the safety of patients receiving image guided SABR in 8 fractions of 7.5Gy. The treatment will adhere to organ at risk dose-volume histogram constraints allowing a minimum dose coverage of 75% to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) coverage, and a minimum dose of 75% to 99% of the gross tumour volume (GTV), using dose intensity modulation. These minimums are chosen to represent at least an equivalent BED to the RT standard fractionation of 55 Gy in 20 fractions based on actual treatment dose of 7.5 Gy in 8 fractions. The safety of the regimen will be based on the rate of ≥ Grade 3 treatment related toxicities per CTCAE V5 occurring between start of treatment and one-year from the end of treatment, which are possibly, probably or definitely related to radiotherapy.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The rates of ≥ Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TxR-AEs) will be calculated as the proportion of evaluable patients (along with the 95% CI) who have any &gt;= Grade 3 treatment-related adverse event occurring between the start of RT and one year post-RT, among the total evaluable patients. These rates will be reported (for applicable patients) by T stage (T1 versus T2 versus T3 versus T4 or combined T stages). The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 5.0) for scoring the treatment-related adverse events will be used.&#xD;
The following will be reported at the time of primary endpoint analysis&#xD;
Tabulation of all cases entered, and any patients excluded from the analysis with reasons for exclusion;&#xD;
Distribution of important prognostic baseline and other pre-treatment variables;&#xD;
Frequency and severity of adverse events;&#xD;

    <description>The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate time to locoregional recurrence; 1- year, 3-years and 5-years LRFS; DFS; metastasis-free survival for patients with primary NSCLC; further metastasis-free survival for patients with oligometastatic lesions. These efficacy endpoints will be expressed as median survival with 95% confidence interval. The failure event for disease free survival is defined as death due to any cause, local recurrence, marginal progression, involved node progression, regional progression, distant metastasis, or second primary. Subgroup analyses may be undertaken if the sample sizes involved in each subgroup are adequate to support such analyses.</description>

    <description>The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the domain-specific EORTC QLQ C30 and EORTC QLQ LC13 scores at baseline and 6 months post treatment will be reported. Scoring will be in line with the published guidelines and will use the QLQ-C30 summary score (excluding financial difficulties and global QOL). The scales are from 1(Not at all) to 4(Very Much) with 1 being the best outcome, and from 1(Very poor) to 7(excellent) with 7 being the best outcome. The proportion of patients who report 'quite a bit' and/or 'very much' for each domain or measure will be reported. Changes in scores over time for each patient will be calculated by subtracting the results at baseline from 6 month results. The mean and SD of the changes will be reported. A Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to compare differences from baseline. The number of patients who had a clinically meaningful change in QoL as identified by the method recommended by the EORTC QoL Group at the time of analysis will also be reported.</description>
