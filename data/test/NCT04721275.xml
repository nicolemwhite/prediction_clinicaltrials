    <textblock>
      The main objective of the research is to evaluate the prognostic performance of qSOFA, NEWS&#xD;
      and MEDS scores in patients over 65 years of age presenting to the emergency department with&#xD;
      a diagnosis of infection made by the emergency physician in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main judgment criterion is intra-hospital mortality. Secondary criteria for judgement are&#xD;
      admission to intensive care or intensive care (continuous monitoring unit), length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, length of stay in the emergency room, length of time before antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      is administered. A comparison of score performance will be carried out between the population&#xD;
      aged over 65 years old and the rest of the population.&#xD;

      The main objective of the research is to evaluate the prognostic performance of qSOFA, NEWS&#xD;
      and MEDS scores in patients over 65 years of age presenting to the emergency department with&#xD;
      a diagnosis of infection made by the emergency physician in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main judgment criterion is intra-hospital mortality. Secondary criteria for judgement are&#xD;
      admission to intensive care or intensive care (continuous monitoring unit), length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, length of stay in the emergency room, door-to-antibiotic time. A comparison of&#xD;
      score performance will be carried out between the population aged over 65 years old and the&#xD;
      rest of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EXPECTED FALLOUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Early recognition of patients with potentially severe sepsis and adaptation to&#xD;
           monitoring appropriate to severity will enable patients to be identified and managed&#xD;
           more quickly from the time of assessment by the emergency reception and referral nurse.&#xD;
           In this way, these patients can be integrated into a dedicated line of care enabling&#xD;
           early antibiotic therapy, vascular filling and support by vasopressor amines if&#xD;
           necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Older people present a particularly fragile population with physiological peculiarities.&#xD;
           It is necessary to validate these prognostic scores in this segment of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Design of the study. This study will be a monocentric, prospective,&#xD;
           non-interventional study. The patients recruited will be those who's the emergency&#xD;
           doctor in charge suspects an infection, either through clinical examination or&#xD;
           complementary examinations (radiological, microbiological). The diagnosis of bacterial&#xD;
           infection will be re-evaluated remotely by 2 experts once the follow-up phase is&#xD;
           completed. In case of discrepancies, a consensus will be reached between the 2 experts.&#xD;
           Patients with no confirmed infection will be excluded from the study. Investigators also&#xD;
           exclude pregnant women, minors, patients under legal protection, or patients refusing to&#xD;
           participate, prisoners and patients with localized infections without general&#xD;
           repercussions (abscess, cystitis, angina). For each patient included, the reception and&#xD;
           orientation nurse assisted by the emergency doctor will have to fill in the parameters&#xD;
           needed to calculate qSOFA score, the NEWS score and the MEDS score on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main judgment criterion is intra-hospital mortality at 28 days. Patients still&#xD;
           hospitalized after D28 will be considered still alive. Secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
           admission to intensive care (resuscitation/continuous monitoring unit) for more than 72&#xD;
           hours, length of hospital stay, length of stay in intensive care, door-to-antibiotic&#xD;
           time and a composite endpoint of mortality or admission to intensive care for more than&#xD;
           72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Criteria for inclusion: Adult patient presenting to the adult emergency department&#xD;
           with suspected infection by the reception and orientation nurse or diagnosed by the&#xD;
           emergency physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One subgroup is composed of patients aged 65 years and over, a second subgroup is&#xD;
           composed of patients aged 18 to 64 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Exclusion criteria: Underage patients, vulnerable persons (legal protection)&#xD;
           Pregnant women Prisoner Infection not confirmed after review of the files by the experts&#xD;
           Localized infection without general repercussions: abscess, angina, cystitis. Patient's&#xD;
           opposition to participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion period: 6 months Follow-up period: 28 days Place of study: emergency&#xD;
           department of the Tours CHRU (University Hospital Centre)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BENEFIT/RISK&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study provides a reminder to practitioners of the international recommendations for&#xD;
           sepsis management based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. It can thus be expected to&#xD;
           improve the time taken by patients to receive antibiotic therapy and potentially improve&#xD;
           the triage of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is no risk expected by this study since there is no change in practices. The&#xD;
           objective of this study is to evaluate prognostic performance of scores without&#xD;
           intervention on patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STATISTICAL ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerical variables will be expressed as average and 95% confidence interval, and categorical&#xD;
      variables will be expressed as number and percentage. In the case of missing variables for&#xD;
      scores, investigators assume that the values are within normal values. To achieve the&#xD;
      performance of the qSOFA, NEWS and MEDS scores in predicting the main judgement criterion,&#xD;
      investigators will calculate the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      and negative predictive values) for a qSOFA greater than or equal to 2, a NEWS â‰¥ 5 and a MEDS&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 12. Investigators will construct a ROC curve and calculate an area&#xD;
      under the curve for each score. The scores will be compared with each other in the population&#xD;
      over 65 years old. Each score will also be compared between the population over 65 and the&#xD;
      population 18-64.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A p value of less than 0.05 is considered significant. The analyses are performed using R&#xD;
      software version 3.6.2.&#xD;
