  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that endangers people's&#xD;
      health, causing severe economic and treatment burdens. Sleep breathing disease, as a&#xD;
      complication of COPD, increases the hospitalization rate and mortality of COPD. At present,&#xD;
      community doctors have insufficient knowledge of COPD and its complications, and they also&#xD;
      lack standardized screening and related disease management capabilities. This trail intends&#xD;
      to use IoT medical technology to screen for COPD combined with sleep breathing diseases. It&#xD;
      can establish a two-way referral channel between primary community hospitals and higher-level&#xD;
      hospitals, which provides early warning services for COPD combined with sleep breathing&#xD;
      diseases. This trial explores the impact of sleep breathing disease on COPD's acute&#xD;
      exacerbation, which improves the understanding of COPD patients combined with sleep breathing&#xD;
      diseases. It also improves COPD management and its complications control at the&#xD;
      community-level and reduces COPD patients' potential risks and treatment burdens. It also&#xD;
      explores tiered diagnosis and treatment models for COPD, promotes the construction of&#xD;
      intelligent IoT infrastructure, and enhances standardized diagnosis and treatment of COPD at&#xD;
      the grassroots level in China.&#xD;

      This study is a multi-center joint study, which mainly consists of two parts. First, a&#xD;
      cross-sectional observational study was adopted to recruit patients with stable COPD in&#xD;
      multiple centers. The COPD's diagnostic criteria follow diagnostic guidelines in China, and&#xD;
      the patients were selected among 40-80 years old. Note that we excluded patients who cannot&#xD;
      use IoT's mobile applications and cannot complete sleep monitoring and follow-up visits. All&#xD;
      patients collect sleep monitoring information through wearable devices, together with&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, pulmonary function tests, blood routines, biochemistry,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, COPD assessment scale, modified British Medical Research&#xD;
      Association dyspnea index, St. George's Quality of Life Questionnaire, Sleep Apnea Clinical&#xD;
      Score, Berlin Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Etc. This study estimates patient&#xD;
      health status from the collected information, then diagnoses sleep apnea and calculates sleep&#xD;
      apnea prevalence. Specifically, we build standards from the analysis of sleep monitoring&#xD;
      information, and we form an OSA screening model by applying machine learning algorithms.&#xD;
      Second, we establish a COPD cohort joined with sleep breathing disease, where we select COPD&#xD;
      patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for sleep breathing disease. All patients use&#xD;
      wearable devices and IoT technology for information collection and data management. We also&#xD;
      build the early warning platform, and it allows flexible adjustment on the COPD plan&#xD;
      according to individual differences and community differences. This tudy requires followed up&#xD;
      visit once a month. By observing the number of hospitalizations, the incidence of acute&#xD;
      exacerbations, and other secondary observation indicators of COPD patients, the early warning&#xD;
      platform can analyze COPD's acute exacerbations combined with sleep respiratory disease. We&#xD;
      develop the disease and prognosis model for COPD patients with SAO by applying machine&#xD;
      learning algorithms on the previous platform.&#xD;
