  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute liver failure (ALF) results from an abrupt loss of hepatic metabolic and synthetic&#xD;
      function and leads to encephalopathy and potentially multi-organ dysfunction. Aetiologies&#xD;
      include autoimmune and metabolic diseases, infectious agents and hepatotoxins. Worldwide,&#xD;
      infectious hepatitis (A, B and E) is the most common cause. In Western Europe and the USA,&#xD;
      ALF is most frequently caused by paracetamol intoxication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MBT can produce immediate results to aid in decision making in patients with acute liver&#xD;
      disease. Such a test may affect decision-making regarding transplantation in this setting,&#xD;
      facilitate appropriate discharge from critical care to other hospital units and to home,&#xD;
      provide point of care assessment of therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BreathID can potentially help in determining:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parameter to include patients in transplant list (the UNOS 1A group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification that patient deteriorates and needs extended hospitalization/referral to&#xD;
           ICU/change in management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An addition to the MELD and or other scores to estimate risk in other acute patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional information to that of other commonly utilized prognostic scoring systems&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of the study is to develop a model to predict deterioration of the&#xD;
      liver disease, which incorporates measurements from the MBT along with other potential&#xD;
      variables. The data collected will be used to develop a prediction model using data-mining&#xD;
      methodology (linear and non-linear regression models, binary trees, neural networks, etcâ€¦).&#xD;
      The predictive models may include measurements from the MBT, blood test results, as single&#xD;
      measurements or as trend over time. The model that will be developed, will attempt to predict&#xD;
      the disease deterioration vs. recovery accurately, at an earlier time point than the standard&#xD;
      procedure. A threshold will then be determinate based on adequate sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
