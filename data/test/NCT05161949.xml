  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis (EMS) is a chronic, invaliding, inflammatory gynaecological condition affecting&#xD;
      10-15% of women in reproductive age. EMS is characterized by lesions of endometrial-like&#xD;
      tissue outside the uterus involving pelvic peritoneum and ovaries. In addition, distant foci&#xD;
      are sometimes observed. Unfortunately, the aetiology of the EMS is little known. Although&#xD;
      non-malignant, EMS shares similar features with cancer, such as development of local and&#xD;
      distant foci, resistance to apoptosis and invasion of other tissues with subsequent damage to&#xD;
      the target organs. Moreover, patients with EMS (particularly ovarian EMS) showed high risk&#xD;
      (about 3 to 10 times) of developing epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Epidemiologic,&#xD;
      morphological and molecular studies reported endometrioma as the precursor of EOC, including&#xD;
      clear cell (CCC) endometrioid carcinoma which are both called &quot;EMS-related ovarian carcinoma&#xD;
      (EROC)&quot;. To date, it remains unclear why benign EMS causes malignant transformation. This&#xD;
      multi-step process, unlike high-grade serous carcinomas, offers the possibility to identify&#xD;
      the carcinoma precursors enabling an early diagnosis and in the early stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EOC is the most lethal female gynecological cancer with 25% 5-year overall survival (OS), due&#xD;
      to the lack of effective screening tools, and rapidly spreads over the entire peritoneal&#xD;
      surface (carcinosis) thus involving all abdominal organs. Diagnosis and clinical staging of&#xD;
      EOC is currently performed by qualitative image evaluation although the&#xD;
      sensitivity/specificity is suboptimal. To date, diagnostic, staging, and prognostic factors&#xD;
      are strongly correlated with subjective assessment training and clinician experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic analysis based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has revealed the presence of&#xD;
      cancer-associated gene mutations in EMS. Moreover, the chronic inflammatory process of EMS&#xD;
      involves many factors, such as hormones, cytokines, glycoproteins, and angiogenic factors,&#xD;
      which are expected to become early EMS biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising new branch of cancer research is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to&#xD;
      recognize new image patterns and texture and/or detecting novel biomarkers to improve the&#xD;
      early identification of EROC patients. AI has never been used for EROC and we want to&#xD;
      investigate whether these methods/techniques can support and even improve current diagnostics&#xD;
      and risk assessment. AI will be used to construct a new 3D risk assessment model based on&#xD;
      images and volume of interest&#xD;
