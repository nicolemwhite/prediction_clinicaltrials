  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An incidental gallbladder carcinoma is detected in approximately 0.2% of the cholecystectomy&#xD;
      specimens removed for presumed benign disease. In patients that meet specific criteria, a&#xD;
      surgical re-operation is recommended to treat possible residual tumor disease not treated&#xD;
      with the initial cholecystectomy. The presence of residual disease in the re-intervention&#xD;
      specimen worsens the prognosis of patient survival, according to several published series.&#xD;
      Patients with known or high-risk of residual disease may benefit from a specific strategy&#xD;
      that would improve patient selection before attempting re-resection. A pathology-based score&#xD;
      has been developed but has not been yet validated in an external series of patients. The use&#xD;
      of pathological data from the initial cholecystectomy specimen could identify patients at&#xD;
      risk of residual disease and aid in selecting a specific therapeutic strategy prior to&#xD;
      attempting surgical re-exploration.&#xD;

      -  Sample size: 30 (minimum).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis: populations will be compared with chi-square test or Fisher's&#xD;
           exact test (categorical variables) and Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
           (continuous variables). A univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis will&#xD;
           be performed to evaluate the predictive factors of residual disease. The Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
           method will be applied for survival analysis and curves will be compared using log-rank&#xD;
           test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards ratio will be applied to&#xD;
           determine the predictive factors of survival. Variables with p values inferior to 0.1 in&#xD;
           the univariate analysis will be used to perform the multivariate analysis. Statistical&#xD;
           significance is defined when p &lt; 0.5. The statistical program used will be SPSS version&#xD;
           23.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    At the beginning of the study, the collaboration of several Spanish liver surgery groups was&#xD;
    planned. However, neither group has included a valid record. Likewise, the number of patients&#xD;
    studied in our center has been extremely low.&#xD;

    <description>Presence of tumoral cells in the re-resection specimen or found on staging imaging techniques. It can be local (isolated non-discontinuous involvement of the vesicular bed or the cystic stump), regional (common bile duct involvement, perineural, lymph node or neighboring organ invasion), or distant (discontinuous hepatic involvement -i.e. metastases-, peritoneal carcinomatosis or port-site metastases).</description>

    <description>Pathology-based score that uses T stage, grade of differentiation, presence of lymphovascular and perineural invasion evaluated in the cholecystectomy specimen to pre-operatively predict the presence of residual disease after radical resection. Each factor is assigned a value. Adding these values results in a total risk score that ranges between 3 and 10 points. The scores are separated intro three risk groups: low (3-4), intermediate (5-7) and high (8-10).</description>

    <description>Radical surgery is proposed to participants with pT1b, pT2 or pT3 tumors in the cholecystectomy specimen without evidence of disseminated disease with staging imaging techniques. A resection of the gallbladder bed or an anatomic resection of the hepatic segments IVb/V is performed. A lymphadenectomy of the hepatic hilum is associated in all cases. Common bile duct resection is performed in patients with involvement of the cystic margin.</description>
