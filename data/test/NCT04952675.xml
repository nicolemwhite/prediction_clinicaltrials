    <textblock>
      Precaution of pneumoconiosis is more important than treatment. However, the current process&#xD;
      can't early warn the high-risk dust exposed workers until they are diagnosed with&#xD;
      pneumoconiosis. With the feature of efficiency, impersonality and quantification, artificial&#xD;
      intelligence is just appropriate for solving this problems. Therefore, we are aiming at&#xD;
      adapting deep learning to develop models of pneumoconiosis intelligent detection, grade&#xD;
      diagnosis and high risk early warning. The annotated images will be used for convolutional&#xD;
      neural networks (CNNs) algorithm training, aiming at pneumoconiosis screening and grade&#xD;
      diagnosis. Moreover, risk score calculated by density heat map will be used for early warning&#xD;
      of dust-exposed workers. Then follow up of cohort will be implied to verify the validity of&#xD;
      the risk score. By this way, the high-risk dust-exposed workers will get early intervention&#xD;
      and better prognosis, which can obviously reduce medical burden.&#xD;

      Pneumoconiosis, the predominant occupational disease in China and all over the world. Chest&#xD;
      radiography is the most accessible and affordable radiological test available for the&#xD;
      physical examination of dust-exposed workers and mass screening for pneumoconiosis. But the&#xD;
      diagnosis process has some disadvantages, such as strong subjectivity, inefficiency, and&#xD;
      disability of judgement of borderline lesion, etc. Besides, precaution of pneumoconiosis is&#xD;
      more important than treatment. However, the current process can't early warn the high-risk&#xD;
      dust exposed workers until they are diagnosed with pneumoconiosis. With the feature of&#xD;
      efficiency, impersonality and quantification, artificial intelligence is just appropriate for&#xD;
      solving the aforesaid problems. Up to now, there has been rare research about adapting deep&#xD;
      learning for pneumoconiosis grade diagnosis and high risk early warning. In our previous&#xD;
      studies, we set up a chest radiograph database, which contains more than 100,000 digital&#xD;
      pneumoconiosis radiography images. The result of detection-system evaluation demonstrated&#xD;
      that the accuracy in the identification of pneumoconiosis could reach 90%, with an AUC(Area&#xD;
      Under The Curve) of 0.965 and a sensitivity of 99%. More works need to be continued.&#xD;
      Therefore, we are aiming at adapting deep learning to develop models of pneumoconiosis&#xD;
      intelligent detection, grade diagnosis and high risk early warning. The annotated images will&#xD;
      be used for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) algorithm training, aiming at pneumoconiosis&#xD;
      screening and grade diagnosis. Moreover, risk score calculated by density heat map will be&#xD;
      used for early warning of dust-exposed workers. Then follow up of cohort will be implied to&#xD;
      verify the validity of the risk score. By this way, the high-risk dust-exposed workers will&#xD;
      get early intervention and better prognosis, which can obviously reduce medical burden.&#xD;
