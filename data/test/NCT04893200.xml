  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spread through air space (STAS) has been reported as a negative prognostic factor in patients&#xD;
      with lung cancer undergone sublobar resection. Its preoperative assessment could thus be&#xD;
      useful to customize surgical treatment. Radiomics has been recently proposed to predict STAS&#xD;
      in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. However, all the studies have strictly selected both&#xD;
      imaging and patients, leading to results hardly applicable to daily clinical practice. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to test a radiomics-based prediction model of STAS in practice-based&#xD;
      dataset and verify its validity and translational potentials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological and clinical data from 100 consecutive patients with resected lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma were retrospectively collected for the training section. As in common clinical&#xD;
      practice, preoperative CT images were acquired independently by different physicians and from&#xD;
      different hospitals. Therefore, our dataset presents high variance in model and manufacture&#xD;
      of scanner, acquisition and reconstruction protocol, endovenous contrast phase and pixel&#xD;
      size. To test the effect of normalization in highly varying data, preoperative CT images and&#xD;
      tumor region of interest were preprocessed with four different pipelines. Features were&#xD;
      extracted using pyradiomics and selected considering both separation power and robustness&#xD;
      within pipelines. After that, a radiomics-based prediction model of STAS were created using&#xD;
      the most significant associated features. This model were than validated in a group of 50&#xD;
      patients prospectively enrolled as external validation group to test its efficacy in STAS&#xD;
      prediction.&#xD;
