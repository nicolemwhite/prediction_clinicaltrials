    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common forms of cancer and the second leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer-related deaths in the western world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRC mortality is related to stage of disease with a five year survival for early-stage&#xD;
      disease of 77.0% and 50.8% for late stage disease. Methods for early detection of primary as&#xD;
      well as recurrent CRC are therefore important to increase patient survival. Tumour biomarkers&#xD;
      from blood, stool, or urine could aid the early diagnostics of CRC, but despite extensive&#xD;
      research such markers have only provided limited clinical value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sporadic CRC develops as a result of the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations.&#xD;
      Epigenetic alterations include DNA hypermethylation, which through transcriptional silencing&#xD;
      of tumour suppressor genes is associated with cancer development and cancer progression. The&#xD;
      search for gene promoter regions hypermethylated in cancer has been ongoing for nearly two&#xD;
      decades, and a number of genes have been shown to be preferentially hypermethylated in CRC.&#xD;
      Therefore, hypermethylated DNA in plasma has been suggested as a marker for tumour-stage and&#xD;
      survival in CRC patients. The only approved biomarker for the detection of CRC recurrence is&#xD;
      the protein carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). CEA is limited by its low sensitivity and&#xD;
      therefore not recommended as a diagnostic biomarker. Hypermethylation of CRC specific genes&#xD;
      as part of a molecular biomarker panel measured in blood could prove to be a recurrence&#xD;
      marker in CRC patients, with elevated sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this project are to examine if hypermethylation of specific genes measured from&#xD;
      cell-free DNA in plasma of CRC patients can be used to detect primary CRC, to detect CRC&#xD;
      recurrence and to be a biomarker for CRC prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of a reliable sensitive and specific biomarker for CRC will immensely improve the&#xD;
      diagnostics and handling of CRC patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common forms of cancer and the second leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer-related deaths in the western world, accounting for the annual death of&#xD;
      215.000 europeans in 2012 and an estimated 50.310 Americans in 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sporadic CRC develops through the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in the&#xD;
      epithelial cell-lining. These alterations are thought to push the normal epithelial cells&#xD;
      into the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Detection of hypermethylated DNA can be made in blood or&#xD;
      stool of cancer patients and it is believed, that hypermethylated cell-free DNA in blood and&#xD;
      stool can be used as a cancer biomarker, exhibiting high sensitivity and specificity in CRC&#xD;
      and other major cancer-types (e.g. lung, prostate, and breast cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypermethylated cell-free DNA - measured in plasma - could prove to be a more specific and&#xD;
      sensitive biomarker for CRC than both the detection of blood in stool and CEA in blood of CRC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this project are to examine if hypermethylation of specific genes measured from&#xD;
      cell-free DNA in plasma of CRC patients is a diagnostic biomarker for CRC. The results of&#xD;
      this study will show, if a single blood sample can differentiate patients with CRC from&#xD;
      patients without cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of a reliable sensitive and specific biomarker for CRC will immensely improve the&#xD;
      diagnostics and handling of CRC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To propose the most sensitive and specific hypermethylated DNA promoter regions for CRC&#xD;
      detection, a review of the literature currently available will be undertaken. The following&#xD;
      search criteria (MeSH terms) will be used: &quot;colorectal neoplasm&quot;, &quot;DNA methylation or CpG&#xD;
      islands&quot;, &quot;tumour or stool sample or blood or serum or plasma&quot;, &quot;real time PCR or microarray&#xD;
      analysis or genome sequencing or biopsy or blood analysis&quot;. Based on this review a literature&#xD;
      review will be written: &quot;DNA Methylation in Blood and Stool as a Screening and Prognostic&#xD;
      Marker for Colorectal Cancer&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression, which does not arise due to&#xD;
      changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic alterations include micro-satellite instability,&#xD;
      histone modifications and DNA methylation. DNA methylation is a normal phenomenon in&#xD;
      eukaryotic cells and occurs across the whole genome. Methylation target cytosine-residues&#xD;
      followed by a guanine on the DNA strand (called CpG-islands) converting these to&#xD;
      methyl-cytosine. Un-methylated CpG-islands exist in a high concentration in the promoter&#xD;
      regions of human genes, and DNA promoter hypermethylation leads to decreased transcriptional&#xD;
      activity. This event happens in tumour suppressors leading to gene silencing which is related&#xD;
      to tumour genesis. CpG-Island hypermethylation is shown to be a non-random process and the&#xD;
      pattern of gene hypermethylation appears to be specific to individual cancers. This lead to&#xD;
      the definition of a CpG-Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) in CRC, a panel of genes being&#xD;
      hypermethylated in CRC tumours, and there is a growing body of literature on the correlation&#xD;
      between hypermethylated genes and CRC. This investigation has primarily focused on DNA&#xD;
      obtained from CRC biopsies but in recent years focus has moved to hypermethylated DNA&#xD;
      obtained from blood and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypermethylated genes that have been analysed in blood of CRC patients are e.g. SDC2, THBD,&#xD;
      HIC1, RASSF1A. Hypermethylated SEPT9 has been analysed in a large prospective study to&#xD;
      evaluate its performance as a screening marker, but this only revealed a sensitivity of 48.2%&#xD;
      with a specificity of 91.5%. However when hypermethylated promoter regions are analysed in&#xD;
      concert with others as part of a biomarker panel, markedly better performance has been&#xD;
      reported. A biomarker panel composed of RASSF1A, APC, MGMT, and Wif-1 reached a sensitivity&#xD;
      of 86.5% and a specificity of 92.1% for CRC detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these studies, it is apparent that the profile of hypermethylated DNA in blood samples&#xD;
      from CRC patients is different from the profile measured in healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only two studies have been conducted, prospectively studying the relationship between DNA&#xD;
      hypermethylation measured in blood of CRC patients and risk of cancer recurrence. These&#xD;
      studies are limited by only analysing a single gene promoter region (p16) and a low number of&#xD;
      study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies above show that hypermethylated DNA can be detected in blood of CRC patients,&#xD;
      promoting it as biomarker for CRC. No study has however prospectively analysed the&#xD;
      performance according to treatment and relapse of disease in CRC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on hypermethylated DNA in stool of CRC patients have been conducted using single gene&#xD;
      hypermethylation markers. The gene primarily analysed has been hypermethylated VIM which also&#xD;
      has a commercially available kit for stool analysis. The focus in the stool studies has been&#xD;
      DNA hypermethylation as a screening marker for CRC. One study combined the iFOBT test with&#xD;
      hypermethylation of the PHACTR3 gene, extracted from the iFOBT fluid. A positive result in at&#xD;
      least one of the two tests raised sensitivity to 95% (19/20) at high specificity of 94%&#xD;
      (45/48) for CRC and advanced adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the methods for analysis require bisulfite conversion of the DNA for detection of&#xD;
      methylated cytosines, and Pedersen et al. (2012) recently published an article addressing&#xD;
      this key time-consuming step lowering the analysis-time and increasing the recovery of sparse&#xD;
      amounts of DNA (&lt; 0.1 ng/ml), rendering the test more clinically applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, DNA collected from blood and stool samples of CRC patients has been analysed with&#xD;
      the purpose of discovering hypermethylated genes that are CRC specific. Hypermethylation of&#xD;
      these specific genes in blood samples have been associated with poor prognosis (p16, HLTF,&#xD;
      TMEFF1, ALX4, VIM, and FBN2), early diagnosis (APC, TAC1, SEPT9, NEUROG1, RASSF1A, SDC2, and&#xD;
      THBD) and potential recurrence markers for CRC patients (p16 and TFPI2). Especially THBD and&#xD;
      SDC2 show great promise as markers of early stage CRC, and the fact that it seems possible to&#xD;
      use DNA methylation in blood as a marker of disease recurrence warrants further research,&#xD;
      using these genes individually or in concert with others. Hypermethylation of DNA in stool&#xD;
      samples of CRC patients have not been analysed as thoroughly as in blood samples, though&#xD;
      detection of hypermethylated DNA fragments in stool samples could be used when screening for&#xD;
      CRC. SFRP2, TMEFF2, SPG20, TFPI2, and PHACTR3 have shown promise in the detection of CRC at&#xD;
      early stages or in premalignant lesions. The fact that PHACTR3 could be detected in&#xD;
      iFOBT-fluid (reaching increased sensitivity and specificity) indicates a possible new&#xD;
      screening method, where DNA hypermethylation is analysed in one stool sample. There are&#xD;
      however issues regarding the analytical sensitivity of hypermethylated DNA in stool-samples&#xD;
      from CRC patients. The diagnostic sensitivity for right-sided tumours is lower than for&#xD;
      left-sided tumours suggesting DNA degradation in the colonic lumen before stool excretion.&#xD;
      This promotes blood as the media of choice for detection of hypermethylated genes as&#xD;
      biomarkers in the diagnosis, prognosis and recurrence detection of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD AND STUDY PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To propose the most sensitive and specific hypermethylated DNA promoter regions for CRC&#xD;
           detection, a review of the literature currently available will be undertaken. The search&#xD;
           criteria are listed in the previous section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Colorectal cancer patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood samples from approximately 210 patients diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma&#xD;
           collected prospectively and consecutively at the Department of Surgical&#xD;
           Gastroenterology, Aalborg University Hospital during the time period 2003-2006 will be&#xD;
           used. The blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis, before and after&#xD;
           treatment (surgery and radio-chemo-therapy) and at regular intervals for a time period&#xD;
           of two years after treatment. These blood samples were collected during a previous&#xD;
           PhD-study: &quot;Pre- and postoperative Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Colorectal&#xD;
           Cancer - implications of Radiotherapy&quot; (ID-number VN 2003/102). In collaboration with&#xD;
           the Section of Molecular Diagnostics, Clinical Biochemistry, Aalborg University&#xD;
           Hospital, the methylation profile of the cell-free DNA promoter regions in plasma will&#xD;
           be analysed using methylation specific PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) based on an&#xD;
           accelerated bisulfite treatment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inflammatory bowel disease patients In collaboration with The Department of Medical&#xD;
           Gastroenterology, Aalborg University Hospital, there will be recruited approximately 100&#xD;
           patients with ulcerous colitis for blood sampling (28 ml). In collaboration with the&#xD;
           Section of Molecular Diagnostics, Clinical Biochemistry, Aalborg University Hospital,&#xD;
           the methylation profile of the cell-free DNA promoter regions in plasma will be analysed&#xD;
           using methylation specific PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) based on an accelerated&#xD;
           bisulfite treatment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood samples (8ml) from patients (n=142) who underwent work-up for lower&#xD;
           gastrointestinal malignancy during the time period 2003-2006. Colonoscopy was performed,&#xD;
           and no malignancy or premalignant lesions found. Blood samples were collected&#xD;
           before/after colonoscopy. These blood samples were collected during a previous&#xD;
           PhD-study: &quot;Pre- and postoperative Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Colorectal&#xD;
           Cancer - implications of Radiotherapy&quot; (ID-number VN 2003/102). The plasma samples will&#xD;
           be analysed at the Section of Molecular Diagnostics, Clinical Biochemistry, Aalborg&#xD;
           University Hospital, and the methylation profile of the cell-free DNA in plasma will be&#xD;
           analysed, using methylation specific PCR based on the accelerated bisulfite treatment&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
