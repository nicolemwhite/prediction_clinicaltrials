  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is one of the most common postoperative complications of acute type A&#xD;
      aortic dissection, which is closely related to early postoperative death. Early prevention,&#xD;
      early diagnosis and early treatment are the key to improve the prognosis of such patients. It&#xD;
      has been a hot topic in clinical research for a long time. Previous reports revealed a series&#xD;
      of risk factors for acute kidney injury after aortic dissection, but limited by research&#xD;
      design and single modal data, high quality studies were rare. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      further clarify the risk factors by studying the relationship between preoperative CT renal&#xD;
      perfusion imaging indexes and postoperative acute kidney injury; establish and externally&#xD;
      verify the multimodal radiomics prediction model for acute kidney injury after operation of&#xD;
      aortic dissection combining with preoperative CT renal perfusion imaging and CT angiography&#xD;
      information by analysis methods of information fusion, feature engineering and radiomics, so&#xD;
      as to guide the follow-up clinical practice, improve the prognosis of such patients and save&#xD;
      medical resources.&#xD;
