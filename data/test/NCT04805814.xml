    <textblock>
      Anginal symptoms due to ischaemia with no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) is a common&#xD;
      clinical problem, however, diagnosis and onward management is heterogeneous, and prognosis is&#xD;
      affected. Recent advances in quantifying myocardial blood flow using stress perfusion cardiac&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has potential for accurate detection coronary microvascular&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CorCMR diagnostic study involves stress perfusion CMR in patients with suspected INOCA to&#xD;
      clarify the prevalence of subgroups of patients with underlying problems, such as&#xD;
      microvascular disease or undisclosed obstructive coronary artery disease, that might explain&#xD;
      their anginal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nested, prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blind trial will determine whether&#xD;
      stratified medical therapy guided by the results of the stress perfusion CMR improves&#xD;
      symptoms, well-being, cardiovascular risk and health and economic outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are approximately 2 million men and women living with angina in the UK. In 2014, there&#xD;
      were ~247,000 coronary angiograms performed, mostly for the investigation of known or&#xD;
      suspected angina. However, obstructive CAD is detected in only 1 in 2 patients. The&#xD;
      explanation for the cause(s) of the chest pain are often unclear. Microvascular or&#xD;
      vasospastic angina may be one explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjunctive tests of coronary artery function to diagnose these problems are rarely used&#xD;
      during coronary angiography in the NHS, meaning that patient management may be empirical and&#xD;
      heterogeneous. The lack of adoption of these novel tests in the NHS reflects key gaps in the&#xD;
      clinical evidence. It is these gaps, coupled with the increasing adoption of anatomical&#xD;
      coronary artery imaging with CT coronary angiography (CTCA), which stimulate this research.&#xD;
      In recent large clinical trials, CT coronary angiography has been shown not to reduce the&#xD;
      rate of invasive angiography. In fact, compared to standard care based on stress testing,&#xD;
      CTCA is associated with less improvement in anginal symptoms and in quality of life (PUBMED&#xD;
      ID: 28246175). Anatomical tests, such as CTCA and invasive angiography, do not provide&#xD;
      information on myocardial blood flow. New evidence that addresses these gaps might inform&#xD;
      therapy development and future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current gaps in evidence and guidelines point to a problem of unmet need in the NHS care&#xD;
      pathway. Stress perfusion CMR has potential diagnostic value for microvascular disease, but&#xD;
      whether it might discriminate clinical endotypes in a relatively unselected population of&#xD;
      patients in daily practice, is uncertain. Further, access to stress perfusion CMR varies&#xD;
      widely not least because evidence from randomised trials supporting clinical and economic&#xD;
      benefits from a CMR-guided approach is lacking. CorCMR is a clinical strategy trial that is&#xD;
      designed to address this evidence gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with angina in whom obstructive disease in the epicardial coronary arteries has&#xD;
      been ruled out by coronary angiography ± FFR, stress perfusion CMR will reclassify the&#xD;
      diagnosis leading to changes in treatment (start or stop therapy), improvements in health and&#xD;
      economic outcomes, as compared to decisions based standard care (CMR not disclosed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that an observational, diagnostic study involving stress CMR will provide&#xD;
      information on the prevalence of microvascular disease in a population with anginal symptoms&#xD;
      potentially attributable to myocardial ischaemia with no obstructive coronary arteries&#xD;
      (INOCA). Each diagnosis is linked to a guideline-directed treatment plan.The potential value&#xD;
      of this strategy can only be confirmed if it is associated with patient benefits, which is&#xD;
      why we propose a nested, randomised, controlled, double-blind trial of routine disclosure of&#xD;
      stress perfusion CMR vs. angiography-guided management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography for the investigation of known or suspected&#xD;
      angina and who do not have either structural heart disease or a systemic health problem that&#xD;
      would explain those symptoms will be invited to participate. Written informed consent is&#xD;
      required for participation. Eligibility is further confirmed at the time of the coronary&#xD;
      angiogram by exclusion of obstructive (stenosis &gt;70% in a single segment or 50 - 70% in 2&#xD;
      adjacent segments in an artery &gt;2.5 mm, or FFR ≤0.80) coronary artery disease (CAD). Angina&#xD;
      symptoms will be confirmed by the completion of validated questionnaires and patients will be&#xD;
      invited to attend for a stress perfusion CMR within 3 months of the original coronary&#xD;
      angiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival for the CMR, patients will be randomised (1:1) to either the intervention (CMR&#xD;
      guided, results disclosed) or blinded control group (CMR undertaken but results not&#xD;
      disclosed, standard of care) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial participants will be blinded to treatment group. The clinicians responsible for&#xD;
      on-going care will also be blinded. The design is therefore 'double-blind'. Following the&#xD;
      CMR, patients and clinicians will be advised of the diagnosis (endotype) but not the&#xD;
      randomised group. The endotype will be informed by the CMR in the intervention group but not&#xD;
      in the control group (CMR results not disclosed, angiography-guided). Medical therapy and&#xD;
      lifestyle measures are linked to the endotype and informed by contemporary practice&#xD;
      guidelines. Therefore, optimal guideline-directed medical care according to the endotype is&#xD;
      intended to be the same, regardless of the group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is 280 randomised participants. The minimum follow-up duration is 12 months&#xD;
      from the last participant recruitment. Follow-up will continued in the longer term including,&#xD;
      where feasible, electronic case record linkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the diagnostic study is the reclassification of the initial diagnosis&#xD;
      based on findings from the cardiac MRI scan. The primary outcome of the nested randomised&#xD;
      trial is the within-subject change at 6 months from baseline for the domains of the Seattle&#xD;
      Angina Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include other Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) to describe other&#xD;
      aspects of health and wellbeing. These include EQ-5D-5L, Illness perception (Brief IPQ),&#xD;
      Treatment satisfaction (TSQM), Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), the International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) short-form and a pain questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is preliminary evidence that small vessel disease can be a systemic problem affecting&#xD;
      different organs. Whether small vessel disease in the heart might associate with small vessel&#xD;
      disease in the brain or retina is unknown. In the CorMicA pilot study, studies of small&#xD;
      vessels isolated from biopsies found evidence of endothelial dysfunction and increased&#xD;
      responsiveness of the blood vessels to naturally-occurring, constriction-inducing peptides&#xD;
      such as endothelin and thromboxane. For these reasons, we plan heart-brain-retina and&#xD;
      peripheral vascular substudies.&#xD;
