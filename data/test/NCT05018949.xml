  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no hard and fast rule guiding the clinical decision between angioplasty and&#xD;
      amputation. As such, this decision is greatly dependant on each clinician's experience and&#xD;
      preference as to whether treatment should be conservative or aggressive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angioplasty can help restore blood flow and long-term patency of the blood vessels can help&#xD;
      prevent major surgeries, such as amputation which affects patient's quality of life. However,&#xD;
      some of these patients do not benefit from angioplasty and eventually had to undergo&#xD;
      amputation. On the other hand, there are patients that undergo amputation, but may stand to&#xD;
      benefit from angioplasty. Hence, it is essential to identify patients that will likely&#xD;
      benefit from angioplasty to increase limb salvage rate. Many studies performed have also&#xD;
      concluded that before amputations are performed, surgeons should consider angioplasty&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a medical record review of patients that have undergone angioplasty to evaluate&#xD;
      post-angioplasty outcomes, we hope to identify factors that potentially affects these&#xD;
      outcomes. Ultimately with a better understanding of these factors and their impact on&#xD;
      angioplasty outcomes, a predictive model or guideline can be developed to identify patients&#xD;
      that stands to benefit from angioplasty. Such a model can help clinicians to better counsel&#xD;
      patients on the risk and benefits, alternatives and prognosis. Patients can also make a&#xD;
      better informed decision regarding their treatment&#xD;
