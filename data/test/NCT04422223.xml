      A population based incidence cohort will enroll patients newly diagnosed with cirrhosis to&#xD;
      investigate disease characteristics and outcomes, explore mechanisms predicting early death&#xD;
      and hospital admission, and assess new monitoring tools in treatment and prevention of&#xD;
      cirrhosis.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION In Denmark the incidence of liver cirrhosis is increasing. From 1996 to 2005 the&#xD;
      number of hospital admissions due to liver cirrhosis rose with 2,500 extra admissions per&#xD;
      year. Patients who are readmitted to the hospital have a higher 90 days mortality than those&#xD;
      who avoid readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver cirrhosis in Denmark is caused by a wide use of alcohol and a population increasing in&#xD;
      age and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course of cirrhosis depends on etiology, age and nutritional status, as well as social&#xD;
      factors such as personal network, employment and economy. Interventional studies on many of&#xD;
      these mechanisms are still unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cirrhosis is related to decreased quality of life and affects patients and relatives both&#xD;
      emotional and socioeconomically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gastro Unit, Amager Hvidovre Hospital has a catchment area of 550,000 citizens in South&#xD;
      and West of Copenhagen. The Gastro Unit diagnoses app. 140 people with liver cirrhosis&#xD;
      yearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient education and rehabilitation is implemented as standard health care after significant&#xD;
      pulmonary or cardiac disease in all regions of Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS A systematic approach to investigation, treatment and rehabilitation in liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis will improve the patient's ability to benefit from medical treatment and health&#xD;
      care offers and increase patient involvement and autonomy in disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic approach to investigation of liver disease will contribute to identify new risk&#xD;
      factors for death, hospital admission and readmission, and decompensation in liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better knowledge on sociodemographic features, use of health care resources and the patient's&#xD;
      physical performance and frailty will improve new actions of personalized treatment,&#xD;
      interventions focusing on patient needs and patient reported outcomes in cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome The primary aim for this prospective cohort study is to improve&#xD;
      characterization, treatment and rehabilitation under and after admission of patients with&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis, with the purpose of improving survival and reducing risk of readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify 'frail patients' and to improve their access to health care offers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve the utilization of health care resources by a systematic approach to patient&#xD;
           characterization and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify co-factors with importance for early death and readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify and explore new targets for treatment and symptom-relief in liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The cohort study will apply an observational prospective incidence cohort design in&#xD;
      which patients will be followed from diagnosis to death or withdrawal from the cohort.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled consecutively within six months of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL FLOW The standardized investigational program includes procedures recommended by&#xD;
      National- and European guidelines for complications in liver cirrhosis, applied at the Gastro&#xD;
      Unit, Medical Division, Amager Hvidovre Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard investigational program will be initiated within six months of inclusion. To&#xD;
      avoid repetition of invasive diagnostic procedures (e.g. upper endoscopy, CT scan or&#xD;
      ultrasound), we will accept retrospective inclusion of data, dating back to time of diagnosis&#xD;
      (maximum six months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard biochemistry will be performed at inclusion and at follow-up after 1,2,3 and 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio Impedance Assessment will be performed at inclusion and at follow up after 1,2,3 and 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of socio demography, loneliness and quality of life will be performed through the&#xD;
      following questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A specific questionnaire assessing socio demography, economic status and use of health&#xD;
           care resources is designed for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Three item loneliness scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Alcohol use by Audit C&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Health related quality of life in cirrhosis by: Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire&#xD;
           (CLDQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Functional disability in work-, social- and family life by: Sheehan Disability Scale&#xD;
           (SDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be retrieved from the participant's medical record concerning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dates and length of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reason for hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results from endoscopic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results from ultrasound, CT scan, and if applied, MR scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results from Dexascan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIO BANK FOR FUTURE RESEARCH For this study a research bio bank for future research will be&#xD;
      established. The bio bank will contain blood, liver tissue and stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bio bank is registered separately by The Danish Data Protection Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA A database in Redcap will be established for the study. Questionnaires will be answered&#xD;
      electronically on an Ipad exporting data directly to Redcap. The Redcap database will use&#xD;
      study ID numbers and initials for identification of participants. An identification list of&#xD;
      all participants will be stored separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to publish all results derived from this trial. The investigators support&#xD;
      open acces policy, and at the end of the trial, all data will be sought published in&#xD;
      anonymous form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS The study is approved by the Scientific Ethics Committees of the Capital Region of&#xD;
      Denmark and The Danish Data Protection Agency before initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thorough characterization and consecutive inclusion will strengthen our knowledge on the&#xD;
      incidence, prevalence and impact of liver disease in the population, and the use of health&#xD;
      care resources allocated to liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will contribute to the finding of formerly unidentified risk factors with&#xD;
      importance for survival and use of health care services; and thereby form the basis of&#xD;
      implementation of changes in health practices, with both economic and medical gain. The study&#xD;
      may also identify new areas for interventional research, with clinically relevant endpoints&#xD;
      that can be translated into favorable changes in health care practice.&#xD;

        All patients with a debut of liver cirrhosis, irrespective of time and circumstances of&#xD;
        diagnosis, comorbidities and severity of disease will be offered inclusion in the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A small percentage of patients will be diagnosed with cirrhosis at a very late stage of&#xD;
        disease and have complications compromising their cognitive function. When complications&#xD;
        are considered reversible, enrolment in the study will be sought when the patient has&#xD;
        recovered. When complications are considered irreversible or there may be reasonable doubt&#xD;
        of the patient's survival, patients will be considered eligible, but excluded to avoid&#xD;
        unethical conduction of procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants may be diagnosed with terminal disease or end-stage liver disease. In such a&#xD;
        case, to secure the integrity of the patient, no extra investigational procedures will be&#xD;
        made and only data sampled in standard medical care will be used in the cohort database.&#xD;
