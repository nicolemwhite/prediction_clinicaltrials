  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory skin disorders are usually assessed by disease scoring system such as Scoring AD&#xD;
      (SCORAD)/Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)&#xD;
      for atopic eczema and psoriasis respectively. The current approach to score the severity of&#xD;
      these inflammatory skin disorders is through clinical observations and questionnaires. These&#xD;
      scores however do not reflect the structural characteristics of the skin such as morphology,&#xD;
      vasculature architecture and dermis thickness and are subject to inter and intra-assessor&#xD;
      variability. Objective inflammatory diseases indicators through non-invasive imaging&#xD;
      techniques have the potential to be an important clinical tool to shed light on its severity&#xD;
      in an objective manner. Furthermore, given the abundance of cutaneous vasculature,&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging in patients with chronic inflammatory skin conditions allows the&#xD;
      investigators to evaluate in detail how co-morbidities of metabolic syndrome, especially type&#xD;
      2 diabetes, further affects the vasculature or the epidermis in the skin. It helps to answer&#xD;
      the question of whether a tighter control of the &quot;overlying&quot; skin condition helps in&#xD;
      management of the underlying co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are many skin imaging modalities available to visualize the morphology and&#xD;
      vascular architecture non-invasively, but they are hindered by their penetration depth and&#xD;
      lack of contrast. Examples include optical coherence tomography (OCT), high-frequency&#xD;
      ultrasound, and Doppler based ultrasound. In this study, these shortcomings will be&#xD;
      circumvented through the usage of photoacoustic mesoscopic imaging, a non-invasive, high&#xD;
      resolution, intrinsic or contrast-enhanced imaging technique, which can provide functional&#xD;
      and metabolic information at greater depths, and an optical fibre-based handheld confocal&#xD;
      Raman spectroscopy system with inbuilt data processing algorithms and software, which allows&#xD;
      for highly effective and accurate analysis of various skin constituents, such as ceramides,&#xD;
      filaggrin, and hydration. These technologies will allow the investigators to study&#xD;
      inflammatory and skin barrier markers in, as well as correlations between, psoriasis, eczema,&#xD;
      diabetes, and obesity. In addition, by studying the skin before and after therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions, this study will aid in understanding the mechanisms of action and efficacy of&#xD;
      various interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory skin diseases are increasingly common in various industrialized western&#xD;
      societies. In 2015, eczema or dermatitis, the most common inflammatory skin disease, is&#xD;
      estimated to have affected 245 million people worldwide. In fact, the biggest percentage of&#xD;
      cases seen in National Skin Centre (NSC), Singapore is for dermatitis (34.1%) while other&#xD;
      inflammatory skin diseases such as contact dermatitis and psoriasis account for 4.7% and 3.3%&#xD;
      of the cases respectively. Inflammatory skin diseases can cause remodeling of the&#xD;
      vasculature. This vascular remodeling is brought about by the imbalance between pro- and&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic mediators under conditions of chronic inflammation, resulting in either&#xD;
      vessel growth or recession. Vascular remodeling of affected skin usually display vascular&#xD;
      enlargement during inflammation. In psoriasis, for example, the skin capillaries expand and&#xD;
      become tortuous, making the lesions appear red due to the thinned epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidence reports that chronic inflammatory skin diseases are closely related to&#xD;
      systemic complications such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome due to&#xD;
      systemic inflammation. One possible theory linking cutaneous and systemic vascular diseases&#xD;
      is from the release of products such as inflammatory cytokines produced in affected skin&#xD;
      lesions into the systemic circulation, resulting in the increased risk of inflammation in&#xD;
      other organs or tissues. It was reported that individuals with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) in the&#xD;
      adult US population tend to have a self-reported history of hypertension and adult-onset&#xD;
      diabetes even with control of body mass index and other comorbidities. An analysis of&#xD;
      different studies indicated that both individuals from Asia and North America with pediatric&#xD;
      and adult-onset of AD have a higher chance of being overweight, which can lead to other&#xD;
      metabolic diseases. It was also reported that there is an increased number of inflammatory&#xD;
      cells around vessels seen in histopathology biopsies of the human forearm skin for diabetic&#xD;
      patients compared to non-diabetic populations. The density of vascular network also tended to&#xD;
      be higher in diabetic patients in the forearms compared to non-diabetic subjects. However, no&#xD;
      difference in vascular networks were observed between subjects with Type 1 and Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. The mechanism to explain the increased vessel density in diabetic subjects is not&#xD;
      known, though inflammation plays a role due to the presence of inflammatory cells. Since&#xD;
      inflammatory skin diseases are systemic disorders due to the co-morbidities, it would shed&#xD;
      light on the understanding of these diseases and their linkages to metabolic disease such as&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
