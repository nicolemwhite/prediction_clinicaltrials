  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing Vasculitis are inflammatory diseases of the wall of vessels. Neurological damage&#xD;
      of the peripheral nerve varies from 7% to 50% of cases depending on the type of Necrotizing&#xD;
      Vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral neurological impairment is rarely life threatening (except when associated with&#xD;
      other visceral impairment which, in turn, require urgent management with a severity score&#xD;
      defined by the Five Factor Score) but impacts the functional outcome by sequelae evaluated by&#xD;
      the Vascular Disease Index (VDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four retrospective studies were published with low number of participants, and also mix&#xD;
      subgroups of vasculitis Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmatic Antibodies (ANCA)+/- GPA&#xD;
      (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis), Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA),&#xD;
      Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), and Non Systemic Vasculitic&#xD;
      Neuropathy (NSVN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, management of Necrotizing Vasculitis has evolved significantly over the last two&#xD;
      decades, with a dramatic improvement in survival, thanks to new therapeutic strategies and&#xD;
      medications. Five-year survival increased from 85% for diagnoses made between 1990 and 1999&#xD;
      to 94.5% for diagnoses made after 2010 Evaluation of relapses of vasculitis, late macro&#xD;
      vascular complications, medical-economic evaluation of therapeutic strategies and functional&#xD;
      impairment of neuropathies are at the heart of current medical concerns with a view to&#xD;
      improve vital and functional prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various tests for the evaluation of peripheral neurological damage appear to be relevant&#xD;
      tools in vasculitis, although they are not specific: Muscular force scale Medical research&#xD;
      council (MRC), Rasch-built overall disability scale (RODS), Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and&#xD;
      Treatment (INCAT) disability score, Construction and validation of the chronic acquired&#xD;
      polyneuropathy patient-reported index (CAP-PRI), Health-Related Quality of Life (HR QOL),&#xD;
      Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale (MISS), Neuropsychological Impairment Scale (NIS)&#xD;
      associated to results of repeated Electromyography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, MRC, NIS and RODS measurements were chosen for their reproducibility and&#xD;
      practicality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the immediate or relapse mortality factors assessed by the five-factor score&#xD;
      (FFS), a functional morbidity score specific to neuropathies related to necrotizing&#xD;
      vasculitis must be developed, as well as the determination of the neurosensory disorders and&#xD;
      macro-vascular complications. Therefore it is proposed in this observational study to&#xD;
      determine the factors that can be predictive of the functional evolution, in order to build a&#xD;
      risk score.&#xD;

    <description>The muscle scale grades muscle power on a scale of 0 to 5 in relation to the maximum expected for that muscle.&#xD;
The patient's effort is graded on a scale of 0-5:&#xD;
Grade 5: Muscle contracts normally against full resistance. Grade 4: Muscle strength is reduced but muscle contraction can still move joint against resistance.&#xD;
Grade 3: Muscle strength is further reduced such that the joint can be moved only against gravity with the examiner's resistance completely removed. As an example, the elbow can be moved from full extension to full flexion starting with the arm hanging down at the side.&#xD;
Grade 2: Muscle can move only if the resistance of gravity is removed. As an example, the elbow can be fully flexed only if the arm is maintained in a horizontal plane.&#xD;
Grade 1: Only a trace or flicker of movement is seen or felt in the muscle or fasciculations are observed in the muscle.&#xD;
Grade 0: No movement is observed.</description>

    <description>BVAS is a validated tool for assessment of disease activity in patients with many different forms of vasculitis (21-23). The BVAS includes scored items grouped into 9 organ systems which capture a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations from vasculitis. Scores can range from 0 to 63 being 0 the best and 63 the worst.</description>
