    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the common end-stage of different medical conditions. It is the only&#xD;
      growing cardiovascular disease and its prognosis remains worse than that of many&#xD;
      malignancies. The lack of evidence-based treatment for patients with diastolic HF (HFpEF)&#xD;
      exemplifies that the current &quot;one for all&quot; therapy has to be advanced by an individualized&#xD;
      approach. Inherited cardiomyopathies can serve as paradigmatic examples of different HF&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Both gain- and loss-of-function mutations of the same gene cause disease,&#xD;
      calling for disease-specific agonism or antagonism of this gene´s function. However,&#xD;
      mutations alone do not predict the severity of cardiomyopathies nor therapy, because their&#xD;
      impact on cardiac myocyte function is modified by numerous factors, including the genetic&#xD;
      context. Today, patient-specific cardiac myocytes can be evaluated by the induced pluripotent&#xD;
      stem cell (hiPSC) technology. Yet, unfolding the true potential of this technology requires&#xD;
      robust, quantitative, high content assays. The researchers' recently developed method to&#xD;
      generate 3D-engineered heart tissue (EHT) from hiPSC provides an automated, high content&#xD;
      analysis of heart muscle function and the response to stressors in the dish. The aim of this&#xD;
      project is to make the technology a clinically applicable test. Major steps are (i) in depths&#xD;
      clinical phenotyping and genotyping of patients with cardiomyopathies or HFpEF, (ii)&#xD;
      follow-up of the clinical course, (iii) generation of hiPSC lines (40 patients, 40 healthy&#xD;
      controls), and (iv) quantitative assessment of hiPSC-EHT function under basal conditions and&#xD;
      in response to pro-arrhythmic or cardio-active drugs and chronic afterload enhancement. The&#xD;
      product of this study is an SOP-based assay with standard values for hiPSC-EHT&#xD;
      function/stress responses from healthy volunteers and patients with different heart diseases.&#xD;
      The project could change clinical practice and be a step towards individualized risk&#xD;
      prediction and therapy of HF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, heart function in patients can only be analysed by imaging methods or hemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements. This has dramatically changed by the discovery that hiPSC can be generated from&#xD;
      somatic cells (e.g. fibroblasts) by transduction of pluripotency genes. The investigators and&#xD;
      others have shown that pluripotent stem cells can be efficiently differentiated into beating&#xD;
      cardiac myocytes. This allows for the first time to study the function of cardiac myocytes&#xD;
      from an individual patient. However, at present, only alterations were reproduced in hiPSC&#xD;
      cells that were known previously and important limitations have to be resolved:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immaturity of hiPSC-derived cardiac myocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variability of hiPSC-generation, cardiac myocyte differentiation and experimental&#xD;
           analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No readout of contractile force, the parameter mostly affected in heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No modeling of hemodynamic stress in vitro&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No statistically valid correlation of hiPSC-cardiac myocyte function with&#xD;
           clinical/genetic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncertainty as to standard values and adequate controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unclear predictive value&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research challenge for the coming years is to resolve these shortcomings. IndivuHeart&#xD;
      formulates a number of hypotheses and goals that are based on the researchers' longstanding&#xD;
      expertise in tissue engineering and recent, still unpublished data on the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      HCM and its modeling in EHT. The study will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reveal standard values for hiPSC-EHT function in a statistically valid manner, both&#xD;
           under basal and stress conditions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  define a &quot;cardiomyopathy phenotype&quot; in vitro,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  allow new mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of human HCM and DCM,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  uncover HCM-like abnormalities in HFpEF,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  allow individualized drug testing (acute and chronic).&#xD;

    <description>After generation of proband-specific 3D-engineered heart tissue (EHT) from hiPSC we will make a quantitative assessment of hiPSC-EHT function under basal conditions and in response to pro-arrhythmic or cardio-active drugs and chronic afterload enhancement.</description>

    <description>All 40 patients will be subjected to (i) high-end echocardiography including tissue Doppler and speckle tracking technology, (ii) MRI, (iii) spiroergometry and (iv) 24 h-holter ECG monitoring. Key parameters are guideline-recommended indices of systolic (e.g. fractional shortening, ejection fraction) and diastolic heart function (e.g. left atrial size, E/A, E'/A' and E/E´ratios), outflow tract gradient and cardiac remodeling (gadolinium late enhancement). The latter will be only done in HCM/DCM for ethical reasons. Technical analyses will be made at study entry and after 4 years, clinical examinations once a year (Cardiomyopathy Outpatient Clinic). Patients and their treating physicians will be prompted to report any clinical event during the course of the study.</description>

    <description>The genetic part of this project does not focus on the detection of new HCM/DCM disease genes, but on comprehensively determining the molecular basis of cardiomyopathy in the included patients. DNA samples will first be subjected to sequencing of a panel of about 120 cardiomyopathy-related candidate genes, which detects approximately 75% of all disease-causing mutations. The rest will be analysed by whole genome sequencing.&#xD;
The resulting sequence data will be processed using CASAVA, followed by subsequent analyses using the GATK software package provided through the Broad Institute (Boston, USA) and the commercial software CLC-BIO.</description>
