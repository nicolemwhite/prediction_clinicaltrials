  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemocoagulation disorder is recognized to have crucial effects on hemorrhagic or ischemic&#xD;
      diseases. Coagulation-related damages secondary to traumatic brain injury are common and&#xD;
      severe secondary insults of head trauma and often leads to a poor prognosis. In this study,&#xD;
      we sought to assess if posttraumatic hemocoagulation disorders determined using&#xD;
      thromboelastography are associated with coagulation-related damages secondary to traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury, and evaluate their influence on outcome among patients with head trauma. Based&#xD;
      on above results, prediction models or risk scoring systems will be further developed and&#xD;
      validated to predict coagulation-related damages secondary to traumatic brain injury.&#xD;

        Adult patients (18-80 years old) with isolated traumatic brain injury, who are admitted&#xD;
        within 24 hours post-injury are included. To avoid interfering factors, patients with&#xD;
        existing prior neurological disease or known coagulation disorders, patients on&#xD;
        anticoagulants and medications known to affect coagulation function within 30 days before&#xD;
        trauma or receiving blood components prior to blood draw, patients who deteriorate and die&#xD;
        before determining whether coagulation-related damage exists are excluded. Clinical data&#xD;
        are documented, including age, gender, mechanisms of trauma, types of lesions as evidenced&#xD;
        by imaging examination and laboratory examination, etc.&#xD;
