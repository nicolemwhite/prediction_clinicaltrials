      The study ia aiming to the assessment of Mid-Regional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) as a&#xD;
      novel biomarker that can provide accurate short-, mid- and long term prognostic information&#xD;
      in the triage and multi-dimensional risk assessment of patients in the Emergency Department&#xD;
      (ED). A clinical algorithm with predefined MR-proADM cut-off values: &lt;0.75 nmol/L (low risk),&#xD;
      0.75 nmol/L≥ and ≤ 1.5 nmol/L (intermediate risk); &gt;1.5 nmol/L is pre-defined. Based on these&#xD;
      cut-off values, a prespecified algorithm aiming to predict i) reduction of hospitalization in&#xD;
      the ward/ICU and increase of out-patient treatment (rule-out of risk); and ii) reduce adverse&#xD;
      complications (identify patients at risk) will be applied and compared with the initial&#xD;
      clinical decision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency departments (ED) are becoming increasingly over-crowded, with patients facing&#xD;
      prolonged waiting times. This is further aggravated by the shortage of available hospital&#xD;
      space. Therefore, a safe and rapid triaging of patients is essential in improving the&#xD;
      workflow within the ED, maximizing patient safety and comfort, and alleviating any&#xD;
      unnecessary financial burden from the healthcare provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenomedullin (ADM), a 52 amino acid peptide, is a member of the calcitonin peptide family&#xD;
      and is widely expressed in many tissues and organs. It has been shown to have a variety of&#xD;
      physiological functions, including immune-modulating, direct bactericidal, diuretic and&#xD;
      potent vasodilatory activity. In healthy subjects, ADM circulates at low picomolar&#xD;
      concentrations. In many pathological states such as hypertension, renal failure, lower&#xD;
      respiratory diseases and septic shock, plasma levels of adrenomedulin are significantly&#xD;
      up-regulated in proportion to disease severity. These unique properties makes it a&#xD;
      potentially useful marker in determination of the patients most at risk of developing&#xD;
      complications on admission to the ED, in order to rapidly triage and administer the most&#xD;
      effective treatment in the shortest possible time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, reliable measurement of ADM is challenging due to a number of issues, such as: a&#xD;
      short half time of 22 minutes; rapid degradation by proteases; and binding to complement&#xD;
      factor H. Therefore, the increased stability of its precursor molecule,&#xD;
      Mid-Regional(MR)-proADM, allows it to be reliably measured as a surrogate biomarker for the&#xD;
      unstable ADM in a 1:1 ratio. The aim of this study is the assessment of MR-proADM as a novel&#xD;
      biomarker that can provide accurate short-, mid- and long term prognostic information in the&#xD;
      triage and multi-dimensional risk assessment of patients in the ED setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADM, present mainly in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, can act as both a&#xD;
      hormone and cytokine (often termed a &quot;hormokine) in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Its&#xD;
      potent vasodilatory and hypotensive response is elicited through an initial increase in&#xD;
      cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, and a subsequent production of nitric oxide. The&#xD;
      importance of ADM in homeostasis is illustrated by its central role in the up- and down-&#xD;
      regulation of cytokines and other mediators, as well as its own stimulatory and inhibitory&#xD;
      effect on cytokine production. Indeed, interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha&#xD;
      (TNFα) are two of the most potent triggers for ADM production. It is also up-regulated by&#xD;
      hypoxia, bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and shear stress. Moreover,&#xD;
      ADM has potent antimicrobial actions through membrane channel formation and lysis, and&#xD;
      anti-apoptotic properties, it enhances renal excretion of sodium, decreases aldosterone&#xD;
      synthesis and increases renal blood flow and urine volume. The ubiquitous and important&#xD;
      functional role of ADM results in its clinical use in many diverse indications. Its precursor&#xD;
      molecule, MR-proADM, has been shown to be a powerful risk assessment marker in sepsis and&#xD;
      lower respiratory tract infections with the ability to predict 30 day mortality regardless of&#xD;
      the underlying diagnosis. Plasma concentrations of MR-proADM have been also shown to be&#xD;
      elevated in myocardial infarction, and to correlate with the severity of acute and chronic&#xD;
      heart failure. Furthermore, it has been shown that it outperforms BNP and NT-BNP in&#xD;
      predicting mortality in ED patients with dyspnea after 30 days8-12. MR-proADM is also&#xD;
      elevated in various types of glomerulonephritis and progressively increased in patients with&#xD;
      chronic renal failure (CKD) and has greater predictive accuracy in determining risk of CKD&#xD;
      progression, compared to standard GFR measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR-proADM is determined in plasma EDTA samples by an automated immunofluorescent assay&#xD;
      (Thermo ScientificTM BRAHMSTM MR-proADM KRYPTORTM). Healthy individuals have detectable&#xD;
      levels of MR-proADM of approximately 0.4nmol/L. The functional assay sensitivity has been&#xD;
      assessed as being 0.25 nmol/L. Levels of MR-proADM are not influenced by food or water intake&#xD;
      and there are no significant gender-related differences, which optimize its use in risk&#xD;
      assessment. Furthermore, it remains stable up to 72 hours in EDTA plasma at room temperature&#xD;
      and over four freeze/ thaw cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, an algorithm has been validated using MR-proADM cut-off values together&#xD;
      with clinical risk assessment by the ED physician. The application of this model could&#xD;
      potentially lead to an increase of patients safely discharged from the hospital falling into&#xD;
      the low risk category. It has been shown that the prognostic information of this model could&#xD;
      enhance the appropriateness of disposition decisions of patients presenting to the ED with&#xD;
      non-specific complaints (NSC).&#xD;
