      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in China. In order to improve&#xD;
      prognosis of lung cancer as well as provide new therapeutic targets, the identification of&#xD;
      effective biomarkers for the prognosis of lung cancer is of great significance. It has been&#xD;
      reported that some small molecules such as lncRNA, circRNA and polypeptides in human plasm&#xD;
      have good prospects in diagnosing or evaluating the stage of diseases. In this study, we&#xD;
      planned to use multi-omics combined with clinical data to discovery some small molecules that&#xD;
      are potential to predict the prognosis of lung cancer patients. In addition, we want to&#xD;
      construct a new risk score model that provide a candidate model for prognostic evaluation of&#xD;
      lung cancer. And we hope our study can provide insights for precision immunotherapy of lung&#xD;
      cancer by exploring the differences in clinical characteristics, tumor mutation burden, and&#xD;
      tumor immune cell infiltration between different risk score groups.&#xD;
