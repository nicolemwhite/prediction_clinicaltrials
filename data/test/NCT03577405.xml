  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently suffer from&#xD;
      circulatory shock or respiratory distress, with high morbidity and mortality up to 40%. After&#xD;
      initial fluid resuscitation other complications associated with either treatment or disease&#xD;
      may arise. A consequence of treatment might be fluid overload or overfilling. Multiple&#xD;
      studies have shown the possible negative effects of - too much - fluid administration, such&#xD;
      as venous congestion. Venous congestion entails venous fluid overload, manifested by for&#xD;
      example an increased central venous pressure (CVP) or peripheral oedema. This venous&#xD;
      congestion may contribute to the occurrence of short-term organ failure by causing a high&#xD;
      ''afterload'' in the venous tracts of organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus on how to measure venous congestion. It is important to identify&#xD;
      variables that reflect the development of venous congestion in order to investigate whether&#xD;
      venous congestion is associated with short-term organ failure. Variables that indicate venous&#xD;
      congestion may be obtained with clinical examination and biochemical analyses, supplemented&#xD;
      by hemodynamic variables derived from critical care ultrasonography (CCUS) with information&#xD;
      about organ perfusion, and both arterial and venous function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of short-term organ failure can be assessed by collecting clinical,&#xD;
      biochemical and hemodynamic variables at multiple moments. Using repeated measurements is&#xD;
      likely to add dynamic information about the diagnostic and prognostic value of these&#xD;
      variables. The dynamics of variables, in any direction, over time might improve the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of clinical, biochemical and hemodynamic variables&#xD;
      that can be collected at the beside of the critically ill patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and hypotheses This study aims to investigate the association between dynamic variables&#xD;
      that reflect venous congestion and the development of short-term organ failure and mortality&#xD;
      in the critically ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to identify the combination of variables at different&#xD;
      time points that indicate venous congestion and predict patient outcome. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      are to identify a combination of CCUS variables that precede serum creatine rises in patients&#xD;
      who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) after an acute ICU admission {diagnostic}; to identify&#xD;
      a combination of variables per organ system or subset of populations to predict short-term&#xD;
      organ deterioration and 7-day mortality {prognostic}; to identify a combination of variables&#xD;
      over 48 hours of ICU admission that predict long-term (90 day) morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      {prognostic} and; to validate multiple prognostic risk scores developed for critically ill&#xD;
      ICU patients.&#xD;

      Registry procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the follow-up study of the Simple Intensive Care Studies I (SICS-I,&#xD;
      NCT02912624). All eligible patients will first be included in the Simple Observational&#xD;
      Critical Care Studies (SOCCS, NCT03553069) within 3 hours after ICU admission. The SOCCS&#xD;
      includes all acutely admitted ICU patients by means of a standardized onetime physical&#xD;
      examination and registration of observational standard care data to predict patient outcome.&#xD;
      The SICS-II will screen these included patients within 24 hours of ICU admission and exclude&#xD;
      patients with a non-traumatic neurological reason for admission. All eligible patients will&#xD;
      undergo clinical examination and critical care ultrasonography on day one, three and five.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring will be performed by independent researchers of the University Medical Center&#xD;
      Groningen (UMCG). Audits are planned to take place once a year. The first audit is planned in&#xD;
      August 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients and measurements of variables will be performed by the study&#xD;
      coordinator or a co-researcher under supervision and responsibility of the principle&#xD;
      investigator. Due to its observational nature, informed consent is not deemed necessary for&#xD;
      this study. However, we will obtain informed consent to also cover possible advances within&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data verification At inclusion all conventional hemodynamic variables are derived by&#xD;
      physical examination and recording data from the basic hemodynamic monitoring (Philips&#xD;
      ImageVue monitor with tracing of heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2), arterial pressure from arterial line pressure measurement and/or from&#xD;
      non-invasively blood pressure monitoring. CCUS will be used to envision cardiac function,&#xD;
      pulmonary edema, venal cave overload and renal perfusion. All variables are predefined (see&#xD;
      data dictionary) to standardize all measurements conducted by the student researchers. A CCUS&#xD;
      protocol was written before start of the study to train researchers in CCUS during a pilot&#xD;
      phase. Researchers were trained by an expert cardiologist-intensivist. Measurements will&#xD;
      later be validated by independent specialists blinded for all other measurements. General&#xD;
      patient characteristics and laboratory measurements were recorded from patient's electronic&#xD;
      charts and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and IV score,&#xD;
      Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS) scores are extracted from our local National&#xD;
      Intensive Care Evaluation database. Follow-up of all-cause mortality will be acquired using&#xD;
      the municipal personal records database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are collected on different moments as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T=0, patient admission, extracted from electronic patient file Date and time of admission and&#xD;
      patient history are recorded. T=1, within 3 hours of inclusion, variables obtained through&#xD;
      physical examination (SOCCS) Heart rate (HR): will be recorded from the bedside&#xD;
      electrocardiographic monitor. In case of an irregular rhythm (i.e. atrial fibrillation) the&#xD;
      investigators will use the mean heart rate over a minute. Presence of atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP): will be recorded from the bedside electrocardiographic monitor, measured using an&#xD;
      arterial line Central venous pressure (CVP): will be recorded if a central venous line is&#xD;
      situated in the internal jugular or subclavian vene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory rate: will be recorded from the bedside electrocardiographic monitor. If a&#xD;
      patient is on mechanical ventilation, see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capillary refill time (CRT): will be measured after exerting firm pressure for 10 seconds,&#xD;
      preferably on the sternum and on the central part of the knee. The original upper limit of a&#xD;
      normal CRT was considered to be 2 seconds by Champions' Trauma score (Champion HR, Sacco WJ,&#xD;
      Hannan DS, et al. Assessment of injury severity: the triage index. Crit Care Med 1980). CRT&#xD;
      in a healthy population is age and temperature dependent with an upper limit for healthy&#xD;
      older adults of 4.5 seconds (Schriger DL, Baraff L. Defining normal capillary refill:&#xD;
      variation with age, sex, and temperature. Ann Emerg Med 1988). In 2011 Ait-Oufella et al&#xD;
      found that an index CRT upper limit of 2.4 seconds is predictive of 14-day mortality in&#xD;
      septic shock patients (Ait-Oufella et al. Capillary refill time exploration during septic&#xD;
      shock. Intensive Care Med 2014). The investigators will therefore both use a cut-off value of&#xD;
      2.5, 4.5 seconds and a continuous measure of CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central temperature (Tcentral): will be measured using the already available temperature&#xD;
      sensor which is attached through the bladder catheter. If this is not available, rectal or&#xD;
      aural temperature will be recorded if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin temperature (Tskin): will be measured subjectively and objectively. The subjective&#xD;
      measure will be conducted by palpating the patient's extremities. A distinction between&#xD;
      either 'warm' or 'cold' will be made using the dorsal surface of the hands of the examiner.&#xD;
      Patients will be considered to have 'cold' skin extremities if all examined extremities are&#xD;
      considered cool, or if only the lower extremities are cool despite warm upper extremities.&#xD;
      The objective measurements will be performed with a skin probe, placed on the dorsum of the&#xD;
      foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mottling score: this score was described by Ait-Oufella et al in 2011 (Ait-Oufella et al.&#xD;
      Mottling score predicts survival in septic shock. Intensive Care Med 2011). The score ranges&#xD;
      from 0 -5, depending on the extensiveness of the mottled area. A score of 0-1 is regarded&#xD;
      mild, 2-3 moderate and 4-5 severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral edema: Pit depth was estimated visually and according to Brodovicz et al: 0=no&#xD;
      clinical edema, 1=slight pitting (2 mm depth) with no visible distortion, 2=somewhat deeper&#xD;
      pit (4 mm) with no readily detectable distortion, 3=noticeably deep pit (6 mm) with the&#xD;
      dependent extremity full and swollen, and 4=very deep pit (8 mm) with the dependent extremity&#xD;
      grossly distorted. (Brodovicz KG, McNaughton K, Uemura N, Meininger G, Girman CJ, Yale SH.&#xD;
      Reliability and feasibility of methods to quantitatively assess peripheral edema. Clin Med&#xD;
      Res. 2009;7(1-2):21-31. doi:10.3121/cmr.2009.819).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine output (ml/kg/h): measured as part of regular care. The investigators will use both the&#xD;
      urine output over the hour before examination and the mean urine output per hour, calculated&#xD;
      using the six hours prior to the physical examination. If these data are unavailable, the&#xD;
      mean urine output of the previous hour(s) will be calculated depending on the available data.&#xD;
      In patients with pre-existing renal failure, urine output will be recorded but not used for&#xD;
      primary analysis of kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMV score: this can be used to obtain a quick impression of a patient's state of&#xD;
      consciousness. EMV score will be corrected in case of sedated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum lactate, creatinine and hemoglobin: are determined as part of regular care. For study&#xD;
      purposes the investigators will use the value closest to our examination. Other biochemical&#xD;
      values will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation: data on the presence and type of mechanical ventilation will be&#xD;
      collected, as well as basic information on respiratory conditions (i.e. PEEP and respiratory&#xD;
      rate). Note: in case of mechanical ventilation the value 'respiratory rate' will be filled in&#xD;
      twice in the CRF. If both values are the same, it will be assumed that the patient breathes&#xD;
      at a machine-set respiratory rate. If they differ, spontaneous breathing will be assumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive ventilation: data on the type of ventilation (e.g. Ventimask, nasal cannula)&#xD;
      will be gathered, as well as FiO2 and SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inotrope-, vasopressor and sedative use: any inotrope or vasopressin requirement, type, dose&#xD;
      and speed will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimations of pump function and patient outcome: an estimation will be made, either by a&#xD;
      member of the treating team, or by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T=2, within 24 hours of admission, physical examination, CCUS and biochemical variables All&#xD;
      variables mentioned in T=1 will be collected again. Furthermore, a CCUS will be performed.&#xD;
      Using CCUS, the following variables will be obtained by trained researchers. Exact methods&#xD;
      are described in the CCUS SICS-II protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac output: will be measured by transthoracic echocardiography. Both cardiac output and&#xD;
      cardiac index (i.e. cardiac output corrected for body surface area) will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE): will be measured in the apical 4 chamber&#xD;
      view using M-Mode, as a variable that reflects right ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitral Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (MAPSE): will be measured in the apical 4 chamber&#xD;
      view using M-Mode, as a variable that reflects left ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right Ventricular Systolic Excursion (RV S'): will be measured in the apical 4 chamber view,&#xD;
      using Tissue Velocity Imaging, as a variable that reflects right ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strain: Color Tissue Dopper Imaging is performed on the RV free wall, septum and LV free wall&#xD;
      to study regional and global systolic function by means of strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kerly B-Lines: B-lines will be investigated using pulmonary ultrasound following the BLUE&#xD;
      protocol (Lichtenstein D.A. BLUE-protocol and FALLS-protocol: two applications of lung&#xD;
      ultrasound in the critically ill. Chest 2015). More than 3 B-lines per view point will be&#xD;
      considered abnormal and as a possible sign of pulmonary edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferior vena cava: the investigators will measure both diameter, obtained using CCUS just&#xD;
      below the xiphoid process, and the Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index (IVCCI), allowing&#xD;
      analysis of fluid status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal ultrasound: the kidney will be envisioned using the 4C abdominal probe. The kidney size&#xD;
      will be measured in centimeters. Doppler will be used to analyze the renal resistive index&#xD;
      (RI), venous impedance index (VII) and the intrarenal venous flow pattern (IRVF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      T=3 and T=4, respectively on day 3 and day 5 after admission, include the same variables from&#xD;
      T=2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded using OpenClinica and transferred for analysis. After export from&#xD;
      OpenClinica, all data will be managed with Stata version 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)&#xD;
      All study subjects will receive a study subject ID in line with the SOCCS. This study subject&#xD;
      ID will be used in both OpenClinica and Stata. Only a researcher with 'study director'&#xD;
      account properties in OpenClinica will be able to link study subject ID to patient number.&#xD;
      Images will be saved anonymously and will be coded in a systematic fashion, using the study&#xD;
      subject ID, session number, and image contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an observational and explorative study evaluating unknown associations, no exact&#xD;
      sample size could be calculated. It is however estimated that around 900 subjects will be&#xD;
      included based on admittance numbers and previous experience with SICS-I. Roughly 3000&#xD;
      patients are admitted to the ICU in the UMCG each year, of which 50% (1500) is acutely&#xD;
      admitted. It is expected that 70% (1050) of these unplanned admissions will fulfill the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. However, it will probably not be possible to include all eligible&#xD;
      patients due to logistic and practical reasons. Therefore, the aim is to include at least 300&#xD;
      patients each year, in total an estimated 900 patients during the entire study period. We&#xD;
      have described overal statistical plan in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) of SICS-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will follow the steps proposed by Jakobsen et al and will first identify the mechanisms&#xD;
      causing missing data: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and&#xD;
      missing not at random (MNAR) [Jakobsen JC, Gluud C, Wetterslev J, Winkel P. When and how&#xD;
      should multiple imputation be used for handling missing data in randomised clinical trials -&#xD;
      a practical guide with flowcharts. BMC Med Res Methodol, 2017]. Missing values are MCAR when&#xD;
      there is no correlation between the missing values and other observed data: a statistically&#xD;
      insignificant Little's test (P&gt;0.05) confirms that the missing values are MCAR, and a&#xD;
      significant test confirms a MAR or MNAR pattern in our missing values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From our experiences with the SICS-I, we expect the data to be MAR. Therefore, we will&#xD;
      conduct our primary analyses with imputation for missing data using multiple imputations&#xD;
      (MI). A threshold of up to 50% missing data will be considered acceptable for use of MI.&#xD;
      Robustness of conclusions will be checked by secondary sensitivity analyses including&#xD;
      available data and imputation of worst-best and best-worst case scenarios covering also&#xD;
      missing not at random (MNAR) scenarios. If our missing values are MCAR or missingness is only&#xD;
      confined to the outcome variable, we will use complete case analysis for our primary&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the general characteristics to create a baseline table.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using the Stata 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).&#xD;
      Data will be presented as means with standard deviation if normally distributed or as medians&#xD;
      with ranges in case of skewed data. Categorical or dichotomous data will be presented as&#xD;
      proportions with confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate analyses will be conducted and all variables with p&lt;0.25 will be included in the&#xD;
      multivariate models. Multivariate analyses will be conducted using forward stepwise&#xD;
      regression by adding blocks of variables. All analyses will be adjusted for age and gender;&#xD;
      other general characteristics will not be added to the model standardly. All analyses will be&#xD;
      tested two-sided and p-values of less than 0.05 will be considered as statistical&#xD;
      significant. Multiplicity issues will be addressed in our detailed SAP. Furthermore, we will&#xD;
      assess the possibilities of Machine Learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence which allows data scientists to&#xD;
      design supervised or unsupervised algorithms to &quot;learn&quot; from generally large data samples by&#xD;
      means of inference. ML was mostly used as method in gene analysis but since then&#xD;
      possibilities have increased. It has been proven that ML may boost clinically-oriented&#xD;
      research and the analysis of big data. Furthermore, the use of ML-based frameworks in&#xD;
      critical care has been reported in several studies, using different types of data. This data&#xD;
      can be obtained in different ways, with the most common being through bedside measurements,&#xD;
      which is how most data within this research will be gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is mainly explorative because there is currently no&#xD;
      consensus about which (combination of) variables to use to diagnose venous congestion. The&#xD;
      aim is to define venous congestion after analysis of normal values and patterns within&#xD;
      patients of the variables that reflect venous congestion. It is expected that then an&#xD;
      algorithm can be generated to establish a cut-off for venous congestion. Longitudinal data&#xD;
      analyses will be used to assess the differences in variables between different moments.&#xD;
      Mortality will be modelled using multivariable logistic regression and survival analyses. A&#xD;
      statistician will be consulted to further review the statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
