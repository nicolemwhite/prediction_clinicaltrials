      The main purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of &quot;nudges&quot; to&#xD;
      clinicians, to patients, or to both in increasing Serious Illness Conversation (SIC)&#xD;
      documentation; and to identify moderators of implementation effects on SIC documentation. The&#xD;
      investigators will employ rapid-cycle approaches to optimize the framing of nudges to&#xD;
      clinicians and patients prior to initiating the trial and mixed methods to explore contextual&#xD;
      factors and mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a four-arm pragmatic cluster randomize clinical trial to test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of nudges to clinicians, nudges to patients, or nudges to both in&#xD;
      increasing the frequency and timeliness of SIC documentation in cancer patients vs. usual&#xD;
      care (UC). The investigators hypothesize that each of the implementation strategy arms will&#xD;
      significantly increase SIC documentation compared to UC and that the combination of nudges to&#xD;
      clinicians and to patients will be the most effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer often experience physical and emotional distress, utilize unplanned&#xD;
      acute care, and undergo medical interventions that are discordant with their wishes. Given&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic, these adverse outcomes are amplified, particularly for racial/ethnic&#xD;
      minorities. Serious illness conversations (SICs) that elicit patients' values, goals, and&#xD;
      care preferences, particularly early in the disease trajectory, are an evidence-based&#xD;
      practice, improve patient mood and quality of life, and are recommended by national&#xD;
      guidelines. Preliminary data suggests that SICs among patients with cancer are associated&#xD;
      with improved quality of life, increased hospice utilization, and decreased acute care&#xD;
      utilization. However, most patients with advanced cancer die without a documented SIC and&#xD;
      there are well-documented health disparities in implementation for racial and ethnic&#xD;
      minorities. Current strategies to promote SICs, including the multi-component strategies of&#xD;
      the Serious Illness Conversation Program, focus primarily on clinician education and have&#xD;
      marginally increased the timeliness and frequency of SICs and reduced patient anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. While core elements of this program are transferable-such as its structured&#xD;
      guide-clinical use remains low. For example, even after training, clinicians at Penn Medicine&#xD;
      document SICs for fewer than 5% of patients with advanced cancer. There is critical need to&#xD;
      develop, test, and disseminate strategies to improve the frequency of SICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation strategies informed by behavioral economics are ideally suited to address this&#xD;
      problem, which is fundamentally one of clinician and patient behavior change. Clinician&#xD;
      barriers to initiating SICs include optimism bias, or the belief that one's own patient is&#xD;
      unlikely to experience a negative event; uncertainty about prognosis and appropriate timing;&#xD;
      and fear that bringing up end-of-life issues may be distressing to patients. Patient barriers&#xD;
      to SIC initiation include fear of discussing the end of life and beliefs that SICs are not&#xD;
      appropriate until late in the course of cancer. While previous studies have tested financial&#xD;
      incentives for SIC documentation, little research has evaluated behavioral economics-informed&#xD;
      strategies to align both clinicians and patients towards earlier SICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By intentionally modifying the way choices are framed, behavioral nudges can lead to&#xD;
      desirable changes in clinician behavior while preserving clinician choice. The investigators'&#xD;
      preliminary work demonstrates the effectiveness of an implementation strategy focusing on a&#xD;
      clinician nudge, consisting of performance feedback and targeted text messages identifying&#xD;
      patients at high risk of mortality based on a validated machine learning prognostic&#xD;
      algorithm. This strategy led to a threefold increase in SIC documentation for high-risk&#xD;
      patients, equitably across racial/ethnic minority subgroups, and is now in routine use across&#xD;
      Penn Medicine practice sites. However, clinicians still did not document SICs for over half&#xD;
      of patients, illustrating the limitations of a clinician-directed implementation strategy&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will expand on these preliminary findings to evaluate the synergy between&#xD;
      clinician- and patient-directed nudges to increase SIC documentation. The main purpose of&#xD;
      this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of nudges to clinicians, to patients, or&#xD;
      to both in increasing Serious Illness Conversation (SIC) documentation; and to identify&#xD;
      moderators of implementation effects on SIC documentation. The investigators will employ&#xD;
      rapid-cycle approaches to optimize the framing of nudges to clinicians and patients prior to&#xD;
      initiating the trial and mixed methods to explore contextual factors and mechanisms. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a four-arm pragmatic cluster randomize clinical trial to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of nudges to clinicians, nudges to patients, or nudges to both in increasing&#xD;
      the frequency and timeliness of SIC documentation in cancer patients vs. usual care (UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for clinician nudge using mortality prediction and peer comparison: Due to optimism&#xD;
      bias, clinicians routinely overestimate the life expectancy of patients with advanced cancer&#xD;
      and delay SICs until too late in the disease course. In part because of this, clinicians&#xD;
      reinforce a social norm that early SICs are not part of routine oncology care. Providing an&#xD;
      objective assessment of predicted mortality risk may help counteract optimism bias among&#xD;
      clinicians and help them identify patients most likely to benefit from SICs. Moreover, that&#xD;
      individuals desire to conform to an approved behavior (an injunctive norm) and the behavior&#xD;
      of others (a descriptive norm) may contribute to low observed SIC rates, and may also afford&#xD;
      an opportunity for intervention. The investigators expect that periodically reminding&#xD;
      clinicians of their own performance on SIC documentation, while providing both an injunctive&#xD;
      norm (citing national and institutional guidelines) and a descriptive social norm (displaying&#xD;
      the behavior of their best performing peers), will lead clinicians to conform more closely to&#xD;
      these norms, as has been shown in studies conducted in other contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for patient nudge using priming: Priming is a type of nudge that frames information&#xD;
      to activate one's self-efficacy and willingness to engage in behavior change. This type of&#xD;
      nudge has not previously been evaluated as a tool to promote SICs for patients with cancer.&#xD;
      The investigators will test the added impact of a patient nudge designed to prime patients&#xD;
      and, in turn, their clinicians to having a SIC.&#xD;
