  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of direct antiviral agents (DAAs) makes it possible to cure HCV, and the&#xD;
      sustained virological response (SVR) rate is up to 90% after DAAs therapy. However, the&#xD;
      acquisition of SVR does not mean the cure of HCV-related diseases, some patients still&#xD;
      developed liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and other diseases after achived SVR by DAAs&#xD;
      therapy.In this study the investigator would like to bulid a prediction model of HCV-related&#xD;
      disease after DAAs by conducting an ambispective cohort study. The participants of this study&#xD;
      would be adult patients (≥18 years old) with chronic HCV infection and have received DAA&#xD;
      therapy, the investigator would retrospectively collected DAA therapy-related information,&#xD;
      and follow-up all the enrolled participants every 6 months to observe their liver-related&#xD;
      disease outcomes (composite liver outcome, including liver-related deaths, hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma, liver decompensation, and liver transplantation).&#xD;
