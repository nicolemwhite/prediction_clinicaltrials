  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-skin malignancy and the third leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death in North American men. The accurately mapped metastatic state is a necessary&#xD;
      prerequisite to guiding treatment in practice and in clinical trials. Imaging biomarkers&#xD;
      (BMs) can provide information on disease volume and distribution, prognosis, changes in&#xD;
      biologic behavior, therapy-induced changes (both responders and non-responders), durations of&#xD;
      response, emergence of treatment resistance, and the host reaction to the therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of particular relevance to metastatic prostate cancer is the emergence of a promising imaging&#xD;
      technique involving new prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) tracers. This approach has demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting&#xD;
      metastases, prior to and during therapy, than current imaging standard of care (CT and bone&#xD;
      scan), and is not widely clinically available outside of the research realm in North America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography / computer tomography (PET/CT) is a nuclear medicine diagnostic&#xD;
      imaging procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from radiolabeled tracer&#xD;
      molecules in vivo. PSMA is a homodimeric type II membrane metalloenzyme that functions as a&#xD;
      glutamate carboxypeptidase/folate hydrolase and is overexpressed in PCa. PSMA is expressed in&#xD;
      the vast majority of PCa tissue specimens and its degree of expression correlates with a&#xD;
      number of important metrics of PCa tumor aggressiveness including Gleason score, propensity&#xD;
      to metastasize and the development of castration resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [18F]DCFPyL is a promising high-sensitivity second generation PSMA-targeted urea-based PET&#xD;
      probe. Studies employing second-generation PSMA PET/CT imaging in men with biochemical&#xD;
      progression after definitive therapy suggest detection of metastases in over 60% of men&#xD;
      imaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep learning is defined as a variant of artificial neural networks, using multiple layers of&#xD;
      'neurons'. Deep learning has been investigated in medical imaging in numerous applications&#xD;
      across organ systems. In oncology, basic artificial neural networks to support&#xD;
      decision-making have previously been developed retrospectively in breast cancer and prostate&#xD;
      cancer, but have not been validated or integrated prospectively. Novel data-driven methods&#xD;
      are needed to predict outcomes as early as possible in order to guide the duration and the&#xD;
      aggressiveness of a particular therapy. They are also needed for optimal patient selection&#xD;
      based on the patient's response to a given therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators hypothesize that the combination of a highly performing prostate&#xD;
      cancer imaging technique combined with machine learning has high potential. The main&#xD;
      objective of this study is to acquire PSMA-PET data in patients with prostate cancer who&#xD;
      receive treatment and follow-up in order to enable the discovery of predictive imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers through deep learning techniques.&#xD;
