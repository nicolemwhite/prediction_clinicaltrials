  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 70,000 total knee replacement procedures are performed annually in Canada,&#xD;
      representing a growth of 17% over the past 5 years, with further increases anticipated due to&#xD;
      an aging population. While total knee replacement offers improved quality of life for&#xD;
      patients and is cost effective for the healthcare system, 20% of patients routinely report&#xD;
      dissatisfaction with the procedure. Patient dissatisfaction has been strongly linked to unmet&#xD;
      expectations of outcomes after the surgery, especially with respect to physical activity.&#xD;
      Counselling patients on appropriate expectations has been suggested as a means to improve&#xD;
      satisfaction. Recently, our group has developed a tool to predict the functional ability of&#xD;
      an individual patient after total knee replacement. This tool employs machine learning to&#xD;
      classify patients as more likely to maintain or improve function, based on a functional test&#xD;
      performed in clinic while wearing a sensor system around each knee. Implementing this tool in&#xD;
      clinic pre-operatively could assist in setting appropriate expectations for each patient. Our&#xD;
      primary objective is to compare patient satisfaction scores at one year after total knee&#xD;
      replacement in patients who were informed of their specific expected functional outcome&#xD;
      compared to patients who were not informed of their predicted functional outcome. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that patients who are given an informed expectation will have higher satisfaction&#xD;
      scores. This in turn may decrease health system costs associated with additional clinic&#xD;
      visits from dissatisfied patients.&#xD;
