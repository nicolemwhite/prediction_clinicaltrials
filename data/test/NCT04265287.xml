  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children worldwide.&#xD;
      Mortality rates from pediatric severe pneumonia are three times higher in South East Asia&#xD;
      compared to the Western hemisphere. The lack of description of epidemiology, current&#xD;
      management strategies and outcomes of children with severe pneumonia admitted to pediatric&#xD;
      intensive care units (PICUs) in Asia is a barrier to improving pediatric critical care in the&#xD;
      region. The lack of a sustainable pediatric critical care network in Asia makes multinational&#xD;
      PICU studies challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the Pediatric Acute &amp; Critical Care Medicine Asian Network (PACCMAN), the&#xD;
      investigators aim to estimate the burden of pediatric patients admitted to Asian PACCMAN&#xD;
      PICUs due to severe pneumonia that develop pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. The&#xD;
      investigators will characterize etiologies, identify risk factors associated with morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality, and develop prognostic prediction models. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      there are non-modifiable (e.g., etiological agents) and modifiable risk factors (e.g.,&#xD;
      steroid therapy and ventilator strategies) that are associated with poor clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these aims, the investigators propose a prospective multicenter cohort study over&#xD;
      24 months to recruit 2000 children with severe pneumonia. Pertinent demographic, clinical,&#xD;
      microbiological, critical care support and management data will be collected to enable an&#xD;
      investigation of the association between risk factors and clinical outcomes in these&#xD;
      children. Upon completion of this large observational study, the investigators will have a&#xD;
      rich database with detailed information on epidemiology, management strategies and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes for severe pneumonia in Asian children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Pediatric Acute &amp; Critical Care Medicine Asian Network (PACCMAN) is the first pediatric&#xD;
      critical care network in Asia. Through this network and this study, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      provide a comprehensive epidemiological description, clinical management and outcomes of&#xD;
      critically ill children with severe pneumonia across multiple sites in Asia. Through PACCMAN,&#xD;
      the investigators aim to collect clinical data across at least 10 countries on children&#xD;
      admitted to PICUs for severe pneumonia. Detailed data on aetiologies (not limited to&#xD;
      vaccine-preventable pneumonia), broad age groups (not limited to a specific age group of&#xD;
      children), and specific and supportive therapies in the PICU, will allow the investigators to&#xD;
      perform comparative analysis of important non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors&#xD;
      associated with mortality and functional outcomes in a large cohort of children with severe&#xD;
      pneumonia. This sets the stage for multi-center studies to investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      intensive care therapies on the outcomes of children with severe pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim is to study the epidemiology of severe pneumonia is Asian children and&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of currently employed management strategies (related to invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, adjunct and metabolic support) on clinical outcomes in approximately&#xD;
      2000 children with severe pneumonia admitted to PICUs across at least 10 countries in Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To (1) estimate the percentage of pediatric patients admitted to PACCMAN PICUs&#xD;
      due to severe pneumonia; (2) estimate the percentage of pediatric patients admitted to PICUs&#xD;
      for severe pneumonia that develop pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) prior&#xD;
      to PICU discharge or transfer; (3) estimate the overall and PARDS-specific mortality rates&#xD;
      for children admitted for severe pneumonia; (4) characterize/classify etiologies of severe&#xD;
      pneumonia according to the WHO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 1: Obtain distributions and estimates of 28-day ventilation free days and&#xD;
      28-day PICU free days; estimate the proportion of patients requiring extracorporeal membrane&#xD;
      oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2: Identify risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality rates in&#xD;
      children with severe pneumonia in Asia.&#xD;
