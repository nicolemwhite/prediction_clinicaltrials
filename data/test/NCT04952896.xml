  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through the high-throughput feature extraction of magnetic resonance images, the radiomics&#xD;
      prediction model of joint synovial lesions is constructed to explore whether functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance and radiomics can be used for the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and&#xD;
      curative effect monitoring of joint synovial lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study applies functional magnetic resonance and radiomics to the diagnosis of joint&#xD;
      synovial lesions, including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), Intro-Voxel Incoherent Movement&#xD;
      (IVIM) and dynamic contrast enhancement Magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), from the&#xD;
      existing conventional magnetic resonance evaluation to multimodal magnetic resonance&#xD;
      evaluation, aims to have a more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of the&#xD;
      occurrence and development of joint synovial lesions. As a non-invasive imaging method to&#xD;
      assess the condition of the disease, radiomics excavates the deep features contained in the&#xD;
      image, quantifies the joint synovial lesions, and then gives more information to the&#xD;
      clinician in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the joint synovial lesions, provide&#xD;
      important information for the planning of individualized treatment plans for patients with&#xD;
      joint synovial diseases.&#xD;
