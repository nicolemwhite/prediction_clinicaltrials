  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is 3 arms observational study with no intervention that aims to understand the link&#xD;
      between Crohn's disease, microbiome and diet in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease will participate in the study and their&#xD;
      data will be used to create an algorithm about their microbiome, disease, diet, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 other children newly diagnosed will participate in the study and their data will be use&#xD;
      to validate the algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be recruiting 50 healthy participants: 20 that are undergoing an&#xD;
      endoscopy for abdominal pain and 30 that comes to the physician for different reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After parental consent, the participants will receive an explanation of the study and sign a&#xD;
      consent form for colonoscopy. Before colonoscopy, participants will bring fecal samples, give&#xD;
      blood samples, biopsies and biopsy brushes (superficial scraping of the tissue) will be taken&#xD;
      during the operation. These samples will be retained until further consent is obtained for&#xD;
      further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the results of the colonoscopy, children who have been diagnosed with Crohn's&#xD;
      disease will be offered to participate in the second part of the study, they will receive an&#xD;
      explanation about the app, collection of fecal samples at home, diet logs and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, demographic information, medical and family history will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 3 months: the participants will be asked to log data in the app and collect&#xD;
      fecal samples at home. They will be asked to come for a follow up visit where anthropomorphic&#xD;
      measurements and blood samples will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to log in every day to report in the app daily activity and food&#xD;
      intake throughout the study period. Each week, the research coordinator will call on&#xD;
      participants to make sure the app is correctly filled in, collect the stool samples correctly&#xD;
      and answer questions. During the entire study participants will collect fecal samples, every&#xD;
      first week of the month participants will enter information in the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children who have not been diagnosed with Crohn's disease by the colonoscopy, or children&#xD;
      who visit the institute for reasons other than inflammatory bowel disease without a clear&#xD;
      finding will participate in the study control group. If consent is given, fecal samples will&#xD;
      be collected at the entrance of the study and after one year, blood samples, a food&#xD;
      questionnaire and anthropometric indices, demographic information, medical and family history&#xD;
      will be completed.&#xD;

    <description>Using machine learning we will create a trained personalised decision-tree based predictor enabling a significant prediction of nutritional impacts on CD clinical and inflammatory features during the first year of follow-up. It will be based on information gathered from microbiome ( metagenomic and 16s sequencing of stool microbiome), nutritional questionnaire and disease states (via fecal calprotectin test) in children with Crohn's disease.</description>
