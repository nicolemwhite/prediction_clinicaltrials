  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with tandem lesions (TL) are defined as patients with an acute ischemic stroke (AIS)&#xD;
      with occlusion of an intracranial vessel of the anterior circulation and an occlusion or&#xD;
      severe stenosis (70-99%) of the origin of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). The&#xD;
      greatest current limitation in the management of this type of lesion is the use of&#xD;
      antithrombotic medication (double antiaggregation) in the acute phase that is required in&#xD;
      case of placing extracranial stent to stabilize the atheroma plaque. In relation to this&#xD;
      antiplatelet regimen, the latest clinical practice guidelines warn about the risk of&#xD;
      combining intravenous fibrinolysis with antiplatelet medication in the acute phase, since it&#xD;
      seems to increase the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). However, the&#xD;
      non-stabilization of the carotid atheroma plaque is associated with higher rates of cervical&#xD;
      reocclusion, poorer functional prognosis, and higher mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the use of a single antiplatelet agent could be a reasonable alternative. To&#xD;
      establish the best protocol for mono-antiaggregant therapy in the acute phase of TL, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to carry out a prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients with ischemic stroke secondary to TL in the anterior circulation candidates&#xD;
           for mechanical thrombectomy in whom cervical endoprosthesis will be placed in the acute&#xD;
           phase, will be included, randomized to two groups: 500 mg of intravenous (iv) Aspirin vs&#xD;
           Low dose regimen of Tirofiban iv.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Carotid reocclusion rates and sICH rates will be evaluated within the first 24 hours&#xD;
           after mechanical thrombectomy . As a secondary objective, the functional prognosis at 3&#xD;
           months in both groups will be analyzed, as well as a panel of biomarkers predictors of&#xD;
           reocclusion in both groups. Establishing an antiplatelet management protocol in the&#xD;
           acute phase in these patients would be an innovative strategy not developed by any other&#xD;
           group worldwide, and would place us at the forefront of research in the field. Likewise,&#xD;
           developing a clinical-biological predictive model of carotid reocclusion will allow us&#xD;
           to establish risk patients in which to plan alternative treatments. Reference hospitals&#xD;
           in the treatment of ischemic stroke at the national level with sufficient experience in&#xD;
           the management of this pathology will participate in the project.&#xD;

    <description>An intravenous bolus of 500 micrograms of Tirofiban will be intravenously administered in five minutes with an infusion pump (infusion rate: 120 milliliters / hour), which is equivalent to 10 ml (500 micrograms) of Tirofiban. After five minutes, a dose reduction will be programmed to 200 micrograms / hour (infusion rate: 4 milliliters / hour for 24 hours (maximum total infused dose of 96 milliliters).</description>

    <description>A single dose 500 milligrams of Acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRINA®, 500 mg) will be intravenously administered. One vial of ASPIRINA ® in not more than 250 ml in 0.9% sodium chloride solution, 5% and 10% glucose solution, Ringer's solution or lactated Ringer's. The solution for injection should be prepared on the spot and used immediately after preparation. It is highly recommended to administer as soon as possible after femoral puncture and always before stent placement, allowing a 10-minute delay after placement of the cervical endoprosthesis. In case of exceeding this time, the patient will be withdrawn from the trial.</description>

Tirofiban infusion started in the neuroradiology room should be maintained until a control brain computerized tomography (CT) scan is performed at 20 hours (+/-2 hours). Once the absence of parenchymal hematoma is demonstrated in control CT, loading doses of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel will be intravenously administered in the Tirofiban group, and the perfusion must be maintained simultaneously of Tirofiban and oral double antiplatelet therapy for four hours, after which the administration of the experimental drug should be discontinued.</description>

The solution for injection should be prepared on the spot and used immediately after preparation. It is highly recommended to administer as soon as possible after femoral puncture and always before stent placement, allowing a 10-minute delay after placement of the cervical endoprosthesis. In case of exceeding this time, the patient will be withdrawn from the trial. It will not be necessary to maintain aspirin infusion. In the Acetylsalicylic acid group, a head computerized tomography scan will also be performed at 20 (+/- 2 hours) after the endovascular procedure. Once the absence of parenchymal hematoma is demonstrated, a load of clopidogrel and 100 mg of Acetylsalicylic acid will be administered. Oral antiplatelet medication can be administered orally if the patient has a good level of consciousness and is not associated with dysphagia; or by placing a nasogastric tube.</description>
