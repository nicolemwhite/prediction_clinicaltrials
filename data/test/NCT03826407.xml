      Electroencephalogram/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP) data will be collected from 50&#xD;
      participants in coma or other disorder of consciousness (DOC; i.e., Unresponsive Wakefulness&#xD;
      Syndrome [UWS] or Minimally Conscious State [MCS]), clinically diagnosed using the Glasgow&#xD;
      Coma Scale (GCS). For coma patients, EEG recordings will be conducted for up to 24&#xD;
      consecutive hours at a maximum of 5 timepoints, spanning 30 days from the date of&#xD;
      recruitment, to track participants' clinical state. For DOC patients, there will be an&#xD;
      initial EEG recording up to 24 hours, with possible subsequent weekly recordings up to 2&#xD;
      hours. An additional dataset from 40 healthy controls will be collected, each spanning up to&#xD;
      a 12-hour recording period in order to formulate a baseline. Collected data are to form the&#xD;
      basis for automatic analysis and detection of ERP components in DOC, using a machine learning&#xD;
      paradigm. Salient features (i.e., biomarkers) extracted from the ERPs and resting-state EEG&#xD;
      will be identified and combined in an optimal fashion to give an accurate indicator of&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Problem: Coma is a state of unconsciousness with a variety of causes. Traditional tests&#xD;
      for coma outcome prediction are mainly based on a set of clinical observations (e.g.,&#xD;
      pupillary constriction). Recently however, event-related potentials (ERPs; which are&#xD;
      transient electroencephalogram [EEG] responses to auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli) have&#xD;
      been introduced as useful predictors of a positive coma outcome (i.e., emergence). However,&#xD;
      such tests require a skilled neurophysiologist, and such people are in short supply. Also,&#xD;
      none of the current approaches has sufficient positive and negative predictive accuracies to&#xD;
      provide definitive prognoses in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators will apply innovative machine learning methods to analyze&#xD;
      patient EEGs (50 patients and 40 healthy controls) to develop a simple, objective,&#xD;
      replicable, and inexpensive point of care system which can significantly improve the accuracy&#xD;
      of coma prognosis relative to current methods. The physical requirements of the proposed&#xD;
      system consist only of an EEG system (inexpensive in terms of medical equipment) and a&#xD;
      conventional laptop computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The investigators intend to extend the team's newest algorithms and develop&#xD;
      machine learning tools for automatic analysis and detection of ERP components. Preliminary&#xD;
      results by the team in this respect have been very promising. The most salient features&#xD;
      (i.e., biomarkers) extracted from the ERP will be identified and combined in an optimal&#xD;
      fashion to give an accurate indicator of prognosis. Features will be extracted from resting&#xD;
      state brain networks and from network trajectories associated with the processing of ERP&#xD;
      signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed work will enable critical care physicians to assess coma prognosis&#xD;
      with speed and accuracy. Thus, families and their health care team will be provided the most&#xD;
      accurate information possible to guide discussions of goals of care and life-sustaining&#xD;
      therapies in the context of dealing with the consequences of devastating neurological injury.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in multiple electrophysiological measures across specified time points during coma</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 30 days from date of recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>Event-related potentials (ERP) and resting state periods will be assessed at the specified intervals as a difference between successive timepoints. The ERP measures will include amplitude and latency values of N1, P2, MMN, P3a, P3b, and N400 to assess different levels of conscious processing and presence of signs of a conscious state predictive of subsequent emergence. Also, resting EEG measures will be obtained at regular intervals. EEG/ERP data will be recorded for up to 24 consecutive hours at a maximum of 5 timepoints spanning 30 days from the date of recruitment to track the participants' progression. The date of the initial assessment will be denoted as Day 0, and the subsequent assessments will take place ideally on Day 3, Day 10, Day 20 and Day 30, unless there is a ≥ 2 point of change in the patient's GCS score. Change in all specified measures will be assessed across the up to 24-hour recordings taken at 5 different timepoints.</description>

Also, resting EEG measures will be obtained at regular intervals. EEG/ERP data will be recorded for an initial period of up to 24 consecutive hours, followed by up to 2-hour long recordings that may be conducted approximately once a week until the patient either regains full consciousness, is no longer within the Hamilton Health Sciences system, or until 6 months from the date of their enrollment into the study, whichever occurs first.

    <description>Patient emergence will be monitored using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). In the case of patient emergence, the full electrophysiological test procedures are recorded to correlate with traditional behavioral measures. The electrophysiological measures obtained at this timepoint (emergence) will be compared to the same measures obtained at the different time points during coma/DOC (Outcome 1/2) to detect both clinically relevant change and possible prognostic markers that may have been obtained at an earlier test point.</description>
