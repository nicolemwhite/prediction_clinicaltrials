      This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study to determine the value of HRV obtained using&#xD;
      noninvasive actigraphy to quantify the response to pulmonary vasodilator therapy in newly&#xD;
      diagnosed PAH patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single center prospective longitudinal cohort study will take place at the University of&#xD;
      Cincinnati (UC). We will screen adult patients newly diagnosed with PAH and placed on&#xD;
      targeted pulmonary vasodilator therapy by their treating physician for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll 35 eligible participants over a two-year period. HRV will be measured using&#xD;
      the Polarâ„¢ H10 wearable chest actigraphy device in conjunction with analytic software to&#xD;
      capture HRV data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment and completion of the baseline visit, study participants will receive chest&#xD;
      actigraphy device to measure their heart rate for a two hour period twice a week during study&#xD;
      participation. Follow up research visits will be conducted at one-month, 3-months, and&#xD;
      6-months to sync the actigraphy device and assess any AE's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-between these visits, study staff will communicate with participants at two weeks, two&#xD;
      months, 4 months, and 5 months, to identify and address any issues with study actigraphic&#xD;
      device, assess any adverse events and maintain regular contact with study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout study participation, subjects will continue routine clinical care at the direction&#xD;
      of their treating physician as needed.&#xD;
