  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore whether serial changes of data in body composition of patients with sepsis can&#xD;
      help clinician to monitor prognosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use the random number generator to divide the patients into two&#xD;
      groups, the control group (with no nutritional intervention) and the intervention group (with&#xD;
      nutritional intervention). The body composition data (of day 1, 3, 8) of the patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group will be given to the dietitians for adjusting the diet formula according&#xD;
      to the patient's body composition.The patients in control group also will undergo&#xD;
      Bio-electrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) assessment, but not disclosed to the dietitian. The&#xD;
      diet formula will be adjusted on the discretion of the dietitian caring for the septic&#xD;
      patients based on clinical judgement.&#xD;

    <description>In the intervention group, the body composition data (of day 1, 3, 8) will be given to the dietitians for adjusting the diet formula. The diet formula will be adjusted on the discretion of the dietitian caring for the septic patients based on clinical judgement. The policy adopted by the dietary treatment guidelines for sepsis is to adjust the dietary concentration when there is too much extracellular water under the premise of gastrointestinal tolerance. When the skeletal muscle mass loss is too fast, the dietitians will increase the protein intake by 1.2g/kg of body weight. For patients with acute renal failure and excess extracellular water accumulation and muscle loss, the dietitians will adjust the protein, sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorus content in the formula. The dietitians will give appropriate nutrition prescriptions based on clinical signs, disease diagnosis and biochemical values.</description>
