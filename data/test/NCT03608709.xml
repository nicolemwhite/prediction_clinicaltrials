  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls in community-dwelling older adults is a frequent problem with an incidence of 30 % in&#xD;
      over-65s and 50 % in over-80s. Incidences are expected to increase significantly in the&#xD;
      future due to population aging. For instance, as of 2017, the global population older than 65&#xD;
      years is estimated to be 962 million and will increase to 1.4 and 2.1 billion in 2030 and&#xD;
      2050 respectively. In Denmark, falls are the most common accidents among older adults with&#xD;
      around 36,000 fall accidents seen annually by the Danish health services and approximately&#xD;
      680 deaths yearly. This high frequency of fall accidents may also support the fact that falls&#xD;
      in Denmark are the fourth most common reason for years lived with disability, thereby giving&#xD;
      rise to reduced quality of life. Also, falls are associated with elevated morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, poorer physical functioning and early admission to long-term care facilities.&#xD;
      Thus, this frequent and escalating problem of fall accidents is of major concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fall prevention is therefore highly relevant. It is recognised that fall-preventive&#xD;
      strategies should take on a multifaceted approach due the multifactorial aetiology of falls.&#xD;
      This is substantiated by more than 400 risk factors of falling that have now been identified.&#xD;
      These spread across different domains including socio-demographics, medical conditions (e.g.&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation), medication, physical performance (e.g. reduced lower extremity strength&#xD;
      or reaction time), psychology (e.g. depression or fear of falling) and cognition (e.g. global&#xD;
      cognitive impairment or reduced executive functioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to aid health care professionals in targeting fall-preventive interventions,&#xD;
      individual assessments of fall risk are imperative. In Denmark, municipalities are obliged to&#xD;
      perform preventive initiatives to preserve the physical, mental and social health along with&#xD;
      the functional capacity and quality of life of their older adults. The aim of these&#xD;
      initiatives is to enable the older adults to live an independent and meaningful life for as&#xD;
      long as possible. Recently, The Danish Health Authority released an updated manual to support&#xD;
      this work. This emphasised the need for development of a validated prediction model to be&#xD;
      used in a municipally environment to identify older adults at risk of falling. This is due to&#xD;
      the abovementioned consequences of falls. To the knowledge of the authors, this is in line&#xD;
      with literature being sparse on prognostic prediction models on falls in community-dwelling&#xD;
      older adults with data collected outside a clinical environment (i.e. hospitals, GPs and&#xD;
      screening or assessment centres).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop and internally validate a multifactorial prognostic prediction model on fall risk&#xD;
      in community-dwelling older adults in a non-clinical setting. The intended use of the model&#xD;
      is, for municipalities, to identify and refer citizens with high risk of falls to&#xD;
      fall-preventive interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate time-consumption for the final prediction model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the prevalence of arrhythmias in community-dwelling older adults.&#xD;

      Study design and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort study with 1-year follow-up will be performed in collaboration with the&#xD;
      municipality of Hjørring, Denmark. A total sample size of 500 participants is expected. This&#xD;
      was chosen due to economical and administrative reasons of the municipality contributing with&#xD;
      personnel to include participants and collect data on predictors. Data for the development&#xD;
      and internal validation of the model will originate from the same cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting, participants, data collectors, process of recruitment and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Danish legislation on health and social services, Danish municipalities are&#xD;
      responsible for developing and initiating prophylactic and health-promoting initiatives for&#xD;
      their senior citizens. This is done through different authorities in the municipality (e.g.&#xD;
      preventive-home-visits, senior activity centres). Also, the municipality of Hjørring&#xD;
      administers a local hall for citizens together with general- and patient associations.&#xD;
      Therefore, data collection will be performed in participants' own homes through&#xD;
      preventive-home-visits, at senior activity centres and at the local hall in the municipality&#xD;
      of Hjørring, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection of predictors will be performed at baseline. The following predictors were&#xD;
      chosen by an expert panel. Reasons are stated at each predictor. First, a brief summary on&#xD;
      the process of how predictors were selected will be given followed by a short description of&#xD;
      each predictor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Predictor selection process: A feasibility study. This model is intended for health care&#xD;
      professionals in a non-clinical setting, in this case the municipality of Hjørring with a&#xD;
      setting consisting of homes and activity centres. Therefore, it needs to be time-efficient,&#xD;
      low-cost and practicable. In order to ease implementation if the model is successful in&#xD;
      accuracy, the predictors for data collection was chosen by an expert panel on the basis of&#xD;
      scientific value and experiences from a feasibility study performed as a precursor for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study investigated the feasibility of measuring a set of predictors, selected&#xD;
      by the expert panel, with regards to time-consumption and user experiences both from&#xD;
      participants and data collectors in order to ensure participant and public involvement. These&#xD;
      predictors constituted the basis from which final selection for the prospective cohort study&#xD;
      was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to collect data on predictors in a time-efficient way. It was decided to collect&#xD;
      these both by tests performed by data collectors and questionnaires filled out by study&#xD;
      participants. All results from tests and questionnaire will be typed into REDCap (Research&#xD;
      Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, USA) electronic data capture tool&#xD;
      hosted at Region Nordjylland, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Arrhythmias: The investigator's study will be the first to investigate the prevalence of&#xD;
      arrhythmias in a Danish population of older adults (+75 years old) by performing data&#xD;
      collection in participants' own environments (i.e. own homes and activity centres). All&#xD;
      participants will receive 5 days of 2-lead continuous heart rhythm monitoring (E-patch&#xD;
      system, BioTelemetry Inc, Denmark).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Lower limb reaction time: This was chosen since a slow reaction time was found in earlier&#xD;
      studies to increase the risk of falling.12 Measurements will be performed using a Nintendo&#xD;
      Wii Balance Board with appropriate software Fysiometer (Bronderslev, Denmark).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Unilateral lower extremity strength: This was chosen since a poor lower strength in lower&#xD;
      extremities was found in earlier studies to increase the risk of falling. Measurements will&#xD;
      be performed using a Nintendo Wii Balance Board with appropriate software Fysiometer&#xD;
      (Bronderslev, Denmark).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Grip strength: This was chosen since a poor grip strength was found in earlier studies to&#xD;
      increase the risk of frailty, which is associated to increased fall risk. Measurements will&#xD;
      be performed using a Nintendo Wii Balance Board with appropriate software Fysiometer&#xD;
      (Bronderslev, Denmark).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Balance with dual-tasking: This was chosen since a poor dual-tasking ability was found in&#xD;
      earlier studies to an increased fall risk. Measurements will be performed using a Nintendo&#xD;
      Wii Balance Board with appropriate software Fysiometer (Bronderslev, Denmark).31&#xD;
      Simultaneously, participants will be instructed mention as many things one can buy in a&#xD;
      supermarket, while attempting to stand still on the board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Walking speed: This was chosen since a poor gait speed was found in earlier studies to an&#xD;
      increased fall risk. Participants will be instructed to do a 4-meter walk at regular speed.&#xD;
      Time spent will be noted using a stop watch. The fastest of the two measurements will be&#xD;
      selected for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Physical activity: This will be measured using an accelerometer incorporated in the hearth&#xD;
      rhythm monitoring device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following list specifies predictors of falls and participant characteristics that will be&#xD;
      included in the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Nutrition status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms of urinary incontinence, pain when walking and dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient self-assessment as a measure of self-awareness of fall risk: Do you think that&#xD;
           you could fall during the next year?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fear of falling using Short FES-I 7 item.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression using Geriatric Depression Scale 4 item.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frailty using Tilburg Frailty Indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activities of Daily Living using Vulnerable Elders Survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orientation-Memory-Concentration test performed over the telephone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Due to nature of the study design, all assessments of predictors for the outcome to&#xD;
      be predicted, future falls, will be blinded.&#xD;

        The target group of PHVs is community-dwelling older adults primarily +75 years old. PHVs&#xD;
        are not offered to citizens already receiving local authority home help except for those&#xD;
        receiving help with cleaning. As of 2017, the target group of PHVs in the municipality of&#xD;
        Hjørring consisted of approximately 4,800 community-dwelling older adults of which 2,053&#xD;
        received a PHV. We expect to include 400 participants from PHVs. Data collection will be&#xD;
        performed by trained nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - The target group of SACs is primarily retirees (+65 years old), but also early retirees&#xD;
        (+60 years old) with reduced physical, psychological or social functional capacity. As of&#xD;
        2018, 318 citizens of the target group attend SACs in the municipality of Hjørring weekly.&#xD;
        We expect to include 100 participants from SACs. However, in case of economical,&#xD;
        administrative or timing problems, this may alter in both PHV and SACs. The activity&#xD;
        centres are staffed with health care workers collecting data for this study.&#xD;
