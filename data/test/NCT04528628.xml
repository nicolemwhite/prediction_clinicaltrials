  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) characterized by high prevalence, high recurrence rate and&#xD;
      high disability rate is a mental illness with the heaviest burden and has become a major&#xD;
      public health issue in China and the world. Great challenges in diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      depression consist of the complicated pathogenesis, a lack of objective diagnostic criteria,&#xD;
      unsatisfactory treatment outcomes and poor treatment compliance. The previous studies of our&#xD;
      research team showed that depression is affected by multiple factors. We could explore&#xD;
      important markers for the diagnosis, treatment and prediction of treatment efficacy in&#xD;
      depressed patients' data collected from different dimensions including immunometabolism,&#xD;
      brain electrophysiology, brain structure and functional neural circuits, neuropsychology and&#xD;
      psychophysiology. Our completed studies in the National Science and Technology Support&#xD;
      Program and National Key Research and Development (R&amp;D) Program of the 12th and 13th&#xD;
      Five-Year Plan in China found that treatment designed for specific clinical subtypes can&#xD;
      improve the treatment effect, and meanwhile, the application of electronic-measurement based&#xD;
      care (e-MBC) combined with smart mobile terminals can effectively provide whole-course&#xD;
      medical management for patients, improve patient compliance and increase the efficacy of&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, due to disease diagnosis based on clinical&#xD;
      symptomatology without subtype distinction and lack of multi-scale biological data mining,&#xD;
      multidimensional assessment and deep integration, the results of most previous studies can&#xD;
      hardly be used in clinical practice. Therefore, there is a strong urge to carry out a&#xD;
      systematic research in which multidimensional evaluation of clinical characteristics and a&#xD;
      large scale of data collection and mining are needed to form clinical diagnosis and optimal&#xD;
      treatment regimens for depression subtypes. To achieve the goal, patients with depression&#xD;
      will be our research subject in this study. First, on the basis of the previous cohort study&#xD;
      and the whole-course e-MBC, patients' data of movement, respiratory rate, heart rate and&#xD;
      sleep will be further collected. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI) technology&#xD;
      such as deep machine learning, the data integrated with EEG imaging and specific&#xD;
      immunometabolic markers in blood will be analyzed with clinical characteristics. The model of&#xD;
      diagnosis and classification will be established based on multidimensional clinical&#xD;
      assessment and verified. Second, through a prospective multicenter randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial, optimal treatment regimens for different depression subtypes and individualized&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation physical intervention technology navigated by AI will be explored so as&#xD;
      to establish a predictive model of curative effect. Finally, long-term follow-up and its&#xD;
      regular data collection can be completed on the patient diagnosis and treatment platform&#xD;
      which is linked to the e-MBC. Thus, a stable clinical cohort and an advanced database&#xD;
      containing multidimensional information of depression will be set up. The whole course e-MBC&#xD;
      management platform will be optimized and promoted to improve patient compliance, treatment&#xD;
      efficiency and prognosis. This study can provide evidence for precise diagnosis and&#xD;
      classification of depression and optimal treatment regimens for different subtypes.&#xD;
