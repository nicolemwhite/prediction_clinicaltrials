    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project is to conduct a physician-initiated Canadian multicentre&#xD;
      observational research study that compares physician judgement and model prediction to&#xD;
      estimate one-year survival in ambulatory heart failure (HF) patients and evaluate the use of&#xD;
      resources according to physician intuitive risk. This study will evaluate the accuracy and&#xD;
      impact of physician intuition and predictive models in the assessment of prognosis in&#xD;
      ambulatory HF patients by: comparing 1-year physician predicted survival and 1-year observed&#xD;
      survival to 1-year model predicted survival; evaluating whether model performance could be&#xD;
      enhanced by incorporating physician intuition; evaluating the accuracy of physician intuition&#xD;
      according to level of confidence in physician intuition (very low, low, moderate, high or&#xD;
      very high); evaluating whether physician expertise impacts accuracy of physician intuition;&#xD;
      and evaluating patient management and use of resources according to physician estimated&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a large and growing medical and economic problem, with over 26 million&#xD;
      people suffering worldwide. The prognosis associated with HF is poor. Optimal management of&#xD;
      patients with HF, crucial to improve outcomes and minimize costs, depends on adequate&#xD;
      assessment of prognosis to decide on appropriate testing and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are predictive models, with satisfactory discrimination and calibration, that can&#xD;
      accurately estimate mortality in HF patients. Despite their availability, physicians seldom&#xD;
      use these models, instead relying on their informed intuition, which has proven to be&#xD;
      limited. No studies have compared physician intuition (standard practice) and model predicted&#xD;
      survival in patients with HF. The investigators therefore propose a Canadian multicentre&#xD;
      study comparing physician intuition and model prediction to estimate one-year survival in&#xD;
      ambulatory HF patients and secondly to assess the possible impact of intuition versus model&#xD;
      prediction on the use of resources. Evaluating whether predictive models are more accurate&#xD;
      than physician intuition will inform the best strategy to assess patient prognosis in HF.&#xD;
      More accurate prognostic estimates will facilitate patient management by matching the need&#xD;
      for further therapy or testing to patient risk thus offering greater clinical benefit and&#xD;
      improving utilization of resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the accuracy and impact of physician intuition and predictive models&#xD;
      in the assessment of prognosis in ambulatory HF patients by: i. comparing the accuracy of&#xD;
      1-year physician predicted survival and 1-year model predicted survival to the true&#xD;
      (observed) 1-year survival; ii. evaluating the accuracy of physician intuition according to&#xD;
      physician's level of confidence in their intuition (very low, low, moderate, high or very&#xD;
      high); iii. evaluating whether physician expertise impacts accuracy of physician intuition;&#xD;
      iv. evaluating whether physician gender, patient gender and physician-patient gender&#xD;
      concordance impact accuracy of physician intuition; and v. studying the association between&#xD;
      physician estimated survival and resource use and related cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that predictive models will more accurately predict mortality&#xD;
      than physicians, with more marked differences in less experienced physicians or when&#xD;
      physician confidence in estimate is low. Physicians will use more resources when they&#xD;
      consider patients to be high risk. If these hypotheses prove correct, incorporation of&#xD;
      user-friendly systems to estimate prognosis into clinical practice can offer clinical&#xD;
      benefit, facilitate patient management and improve utilization of resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Canadian multicentre prospective cohort study of consecutive consenting ambulatory&#xD;
      adult heart failure (HF) patients followed in a HF clinic. Participating centers include&#xD;
      tertiary care hospitals with dedicated HF clinics in British Columbia (St. Paul's Hospital,&#xD;
      Providence Health Care Centre); Manitoba (St. Boniface General Hospital); Ontario (Toronto&#xD;
      General Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, Ottawa Heart Institute, Sunnybrook Hospital, Mount&#xD;
      Sinai Hospital, Hamilton Health Science, Southlake Regional Health Centre); Quebec (McGill&#xD;
      University Health Centre); and Nova Scotia (Nova Scotia Health Authority). These clinics&#xD;
      attend to different HF populations permitting a wide representation of patient profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written informed consent, research assistants will collect clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data from electronic records and paper charts necessary to describe the patient&#xD;
      population and to calculate predictive model survival. These constitute part of the routine&#xD;
      clinical assessment and will include demographic characteristics (age, sex, race),&#xD;
      co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension, smoking, peripheral vascular disease, chronic lung&#xD;
      disease), HF characteristics and history (underlying cause, LVEF by echocardiogram, last HF&#xD;
      hospital admission, medications and use of ICD and/or cardiac resynchronization therapy) and&#xD;
      physical examination (body mass index (BMI), current NYHA class, heart rate, and blood&#xD;
      pressure at rest). Laboratory values will include hemoglobin, leucocytes, lymphocytes,&#xD;
      electrolytes, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), serum creatinine, total cholesterol and uric acid.&#xD;
      Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP and peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2)&#xD;
      will be collected when available. Cardiac rhythm and QRS duration will be collected by&#xD;
      electrocardiography and peak oxygen consumption by cardiopulmonary exercise study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include physicians with different level of expertise in HF (HF cardiologists&#xD;
      and Family Physicians). Physicians will be asked to provide their intuitive estimates of the&#xD;
      likelihood of survival at one year following the patient baseline clinic visit. Physicians&#xD;
      will be blinded to the predicted model survival. In the survey, the physician will: (1)&#xD;
      estimate patient 1-year survival in absolute terms (from 0% to 100%); (2) rate the confidence&#xD;
      in their prediction (from 1 - no confident at all to 5- very confident); (3) collect their&#xD;
      impression about the possibility of initiating assessment to evaluate candidacy for advanced&#xD;
      heart failure therapies including heart transplant or mechanical circulatory support in the&#xD;
      next year (1- not a candidate, 2- patient is already listed, 3- too early, and 4-patient is a&#xD;
      candidate); and (4) record status of optimization of medical management (1- beginning&#xD;
      optimization, 2- early in the process, 3- late in the process, and 4- completed). Patient&#xD;
      candidacy to advanced HF therapies and status of optimization can influence the use of&#xD;
      resources. If a patient is not a candidate for advanced HF therapies or is already under&#xD;
      optimal medical therapy, the use of resources will be lower compared to candidate patients or&#xD;
      patients under medical therapy optimization. This will be considered in the analysis of the&#xD;
      impact of physician intuitive risk on resource utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many predictive models in HF. Of these, the investigators have chosen three models&#xD;
      based on comparably acceptable performance: the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM), the HF&#xD;
      Meta-Score and the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) score. These&#xD;
      models include a set of different variables, they have been validated in contemporary cohorts&#xD;
      of HF patients and have demonstrated excellent calibration and discrimination with a&#xD;
      c-statistic &gt;0.70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed until the last recruited patient is followed for a minimum of&#xD;
      1-year and the following outcomes will be collected: i. Death, urgent VAD implant and urgent&#xD;
      heart transplant. Urgent VAD implant or heart transplant will be defined by the use of&#xD;
      intravenous inotropic support at the time of the surgery. The investigators will collect this&#xD;
      information from electronic records and by linking with the administrative databases housed&#xD;
      at the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) via OHIP number or name and date of&#xD;
      birth (retrieved from the patients' medical records) using deterministic/probabilistic&#xD;
      linkage. CIHI is an independent, not-for-profit organization that provides essential&#xD;
      information on Canada's health systems. This entity houses 28 pan-Canadian databases across&#xD;
      various health sectors. CIHI holds ISO/IEC 27001:2005 certification for information security&#xD;
      management. ii. Utilization of health resources and related costs will be collected by&#xD;
      linking the project database to the administrative databases, administered by the CIHI&#xD;
      Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI DAD) and CIHI National Ambulatory Case Reporting System&#xD;
      (CIHI NACRS). Cost information will be obtained and estimated from the HF clinic at Toronto&#xD;
      General Hospital, which is representative of other HF clinics. The cost associated to&#xD;
      resources in other provinces will be adjusted by a calculated coefficient using publicly&#xD;
      provincial health cost information. The investigators will collect inpatient and outpatient&#xD;
      costs and resources from clinic visits, imaging and laboratory tests, cardiac rehabilitation,&#xD;
      hospitalization and visits to an emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be expressed as a mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges for variables with non-Gaussian distributions. All discrete variables&#xD;
      will be expressed as counts (n) and percentages (%) of the study population. The statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using SAS 9.4 (North Carolina, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess physician intuition in comparison to the performance of&#xD;
      predictive models by comparing their discrimination, calibration and risk reclassification.&#xD;
      Physician intuition and model prediction accuracy will be evaluated separately by physician&#xD;
      expertise: HF cardiologists and family physicians. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazards model will be used to predict 1-year event-free survival with the score from each&#xD;
      model and physician intuition to assess calibration and discrimination, respectively. HF&#xD;
      clinics may see a set of different HF patients and HF cardiologists practicing in the same HF&#xD;
      clinic will potentially have similar practice and intuition. In order to consider this&#xD;
      potential confounding effect, the analysis will be adjusted for HF clinic region (Greater&#xD;
      Toronto Area, Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and British Columbia). Follow up will be&#xD;
      censored as alive at the time of non-urgent VAD or heart transplant or last clinic visit&#xD;
      after a year follow up. Observed versus predicted survival will be used to assess calibration&#xD;
      illustrating the relationship in a scatter plot and will assess and compare intuition and&#xD;
      predictive models' discrimination using Harrell's c-statistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will then use risk reclassification analysis (reclassification tables and&#xD;
      reclassification calibration test) and absolute net reclassification improvement (NRI) to&#xD;
      assess global model performance of physician intuition in comparison to the predictive&#xD;
      models. Risk reclassification analysis will be used to show how patients classified by&#xD;
      physician intuition are reclassified by the predictive models and will compare the observed&#xD;
      and predicted survival in each cross-classified category. The absolute NRI represents the net&#xD;
      proportion of patients correctly or incorrectly classified assessing if patients were&#xD;
      reclassified in the correct direction, i.e. if survivors are reclassified as having better&#xD;
      survival and deceased patients are reclassified as having lower survival. For this analysis,&#xD;
      patients will be classified based on deciles of 1-year predicted survival (100-90%, 90-80%,&#xD;
      80-70% and &lt;70%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between physician intuition and utilization of health resources will be&#xD;
      evaluated by categorizing patients in the pre-defined risk categories (low, medium, high or&#xD;
      very high risk). Multivariate logistic regression will be used to evaluate the association&#xD;
      between physician intuition and resources measured as binary variables (i.e. referral to&#xD;
      specialists or palliative care) and multivariable Poisson regression to evaluate the&#xD;
      association between physician intuition and resources measured as count variables (i.e.&#xD;
      clinic visits) adjusted for region. Cost analysis will be used to evaluate the association&#xD;
      between total annual cost and physician intuition. Cost will be described using median and&#xD;
      interquartile range due to expected positively skewed distribution and evaluate its&#xD;
      association with physician intuition using generalized linear models with a gamma&#xD;
      distribution adding region as a fixed effect. The investigators will evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      model predictive survival using the results from the risk reclassification analysis (e.g. if&#xD;
      the predictive model better reclassified 10% of high-risk patients, 10% of the increased cost&#xD;
      of treating high-risk patients may be saved by using the model).&#xD;
