  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which clinically manifests as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common but elusive illness that can cause significant&#xD;
      disability and death if not promptly diagnosed and effectively treated. The annual incidence&#xD;
      of VTE in the United States is estimated at 1 per 1000. Death occurs in approximately 12% of&#xD;
      PE cases within 1 month of diagnosis. At present, clinical management of VTE and PE is&#xD;
      hampered by gaps in our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms, the wide variety in patient&#xD;
      populations, and incomplete understanding of the long term risks of recurrence and death.&#xD;
      Given the complex presentation and risk associated with these conditions, proper risk&#xD;
      assessment and subsequent prophylaxis for all at-risk patients is crucial. While clinical&#xD;
      prediction rules have been recently developed to associate short-term risks and to stratify&#xD;
      patients with acute PE, there is a dearth of objective biomarkers that can be related to the&#xD;
      long-term prognosis of the disease. In addition to clinical information, clot burden is known&#xD;
      to be strongly associated with clinical outcome of recurrent VTE. The quantification of clot&#xD;
      burden requires imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) has been established as a reference imaging standard in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of PE. In addition to its role as a superb diagnostic tool, CTPA contains a wealth&#xD;
      of information including characteristics of the clot that may be used as biomarkers&#xD;
      associated with prognosis of PE. The work proposed in this application takes advantage of&#xD;
      widely available CTPA imaging biomarker data and extends and advances clinical PE risk&#xD;
      prediction model to include long term (2-year) survival as well as the clinically important&#xD;
      outcome of recurrence. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and identify CTPA&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers that are associated with short-term and long-term prognoses of patients&#xD;
      who were positively diagnosed for PE by CT. The rationale for this proposal is that CT&#xD;
      imaging is a rich source of imaging biomarkers that may be associated with prognosis of PE.&#xD;
      This information will help advance our understanding of the risk and recurrence of PE and&#xD;
      provide a new insight to prognosis and clinical management and treatment of PE. This proposed&#xD;
      research is innovative in that we have developed new CT imaging biomarkers and designed a&#xD;
      clinical trial to assess and validate the prognostic values of these biomarkers. Our central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that CT imaging biomarkers are associated with the risk of death and recurrence&#xD;
      in patients with PE. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to quantify and characterize&#xD;
      pulmonary emboli (volume and distribution) and comorbid cardiovasculopulmonary findings from&#xD;
      CT images of patients who were positively diagnosed for PE by CT; (2) to identify CT imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers that are associated with the prognosis of patients who were positively diagnosed&#xD;
      for PE by CT, and to develop risk prediction tools for death and recurrence; and (3) to&#xD;
      prospectively validate the risk prediction tool, and identify whether the change in CT&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers of PE after initiation of therapy improve the predictive ability for&#xD;
      recurrence and death.&#xD;
