  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is characterized by an incomplete diaphragm formation,&#xD;
      resulting in poor lung development (pulmonary hypoplasia), associated with altered&#xD;
      vascularization of the lung (pulmonary hypertension), with respiratory and cardiovascular&#xD;
      insufficiency at birth. Mortality and morbidity are extremely variable. Several efforts have&#xD;
      been done to identify possible prenatal and postnatal indicators which could accurately&#xD;
      predict patients' prognosis and to promote an individualized management. However, to date the&#xD;
      accuracy of these factors with respect to the prediction of survival and disease severity&#xD;
      still has limits. In the last years, there has been an impressive development of new research&#xD;
      methodologies based on the artificial intelligence, also in the neonatal field. The Machine&#xD;
      Learning (ML) method explores the possibility of building algorithms starting from the&#xD;
      acquisition of relevant clinical data, and using them to make predictions or take decisions.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the ML method has never been applied to predict patient's outcome in newborns&#xD;
      with CDH so far. Moreover, with the available tools, a reliable prediction on patient's risk&#xD;
      of developing severe postnatal PH is not feasible. Our hypothesis is that the use of ML&#xD;
      approach, based on multivariate analysis of different clinical pre- and postnatal variables,&#xD;
      could allow the development of algorithms able to accurately predict patient's outcome.&#xD;

      The investigators will collect clinical and instrumental data regarding prenatal history as&#xD;
      well as the medical and surgical postnatal course. In particular, the investigators will&#xD;
      record data from a prenatal ultrasound performed between 25+0 and 30+6 weeks of gestation&#xD;
      (before &quot;Fetoscopic Endotracheal Occlusion&quot; (FETO) procedure, in case of prenatal treatment):&#xD;
      estimated fetal weight (EFW), amniotic fluid, Doppler velocimetry of umbilical artery, defect&#xD;
      side, herniated organs, observed/expected lung-to-head ratio tracing (O/E LHR%), grading of&#xD;
      hernia severity, Doppler velocimetry of contralateral pulmonary artery. Gestational age at&#xD;
      diagnosis, details about FETO procedure, and the course of pregnancy will be also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On fetal MRI, the investigators will calculate: observed/expected total fetal lung volume&#xD;
      (O/E TFLV%), percentage of liver herniation (%LH), signal intensity of lung and liver on T2&#xD;
      sequences, mediastinal shift angle, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted sequences (DWI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographic pulmonary area will be calculated on digital chest x-ray performed within 24&#xD;
      hours after birth, by tracing the perimeter of the lung outlined by the rib cage and the&#xD;
      diaphragm, excluding the mediastinal structures and the herniated organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the neonatal course, the investigators will focus on pulmonary hypertensive status,&#xD;
      need for ECMO, and deaths. In particular, pulmonary hypertension will be evaluated based on&#xD;
      clinical parameters (such as systemic pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and oxygen&#xD;
      supplementation, inotropic drugs, vasopressors, pulmonary vasodilators) as well as&#xD;
      echocardiographic parameters (systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs) from tricuspid valve&#xD;
      regurgitation, mean pulmonary artery pressure from pulmonary valve regurgitation, pulmonary&#xD;
      artery flow, characteristics of the interventricular sept, shunts, cardiac anomalies).&#xD;
      Echocardiograms in our NICU are performed bedside throughout the hospital stay. The&#xD;
      investigators will consider one exam per day from birth to 48 hours after surgery, one exam&#xD;
      per week in the following 4 weeks, one exam per months until discharge. Other relevant data,&#xD;
      like neurologic complications, metabolic disorders or infections, will be recorded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will record data regarding the surgical course: day of&#xD;
      intervention, type of surgical repair, use of patch, intra- or post-operative complications.&#xD;
