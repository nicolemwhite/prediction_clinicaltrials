  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of morbidity, disability, mortality, and health&#xD;
      expenditures worldwide. A wealth of studies has demonstrated that people of South Asian&#xD;
      ancestry have a higher risk of CHD and particularly premature CHD than most other&#xD;
      racial/ethnic groups, and recent research suggests that this risk is higher in Pakistanis&#xD;
      than in Indians-the two largest SA groups. Pakistan is the 5th most populous country in the&#xD;
      world, and despite these concerning trends, so far there has been a scarcity of large studies&#xD;
      evaluating the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in young-to-middle-aged Pakistanis. Also, there is currently no&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk score specifically tailored to younger Pakistani men and women. The&#xD;
      PAKistan Study of prEmature coronary atHerosclerosis in young AdulTs (PAK-SEHAT) aims at&#xD;
      addressing these important gaps. PAK-SEHAT is an ongoing prospective cohort study that will&#xD;
      enroll 2,000 asymptomatic Pakistani men aged 30 to 45 years and women aged 45 to 55 years&#xD;
      from the general population, free of clinically overt cardiovascular disease. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo a comprehensive baseline exam including coronary computed tomography&#xD;
      angiography, and will be followed for incident events and repeat testing for 5 years.&#xD;
      PAK-SEHAT will allow to determine the prevalence, severity, determinants, and prognostic&#xD;
      significance of early atherosclerosis in apparently healthy young-to-middle-aged Pakistanis.&#xD;
      This knowledge can help inform primordial and primary prevention strategies, enhanced&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk stratification, and potential plaque-screening approaches in Pakistan,&#xD;
      all of which can ultimately help reduce the burden of CHD in the country. In this report&#xD;
      investigators describe the rationale, objectives, methods, and discuss the potential&#xD;
      implications of the PAK-SEHAT study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study Objectives The primary objectives of PAK-SEHAT are: 1) characterize the prevalence and&#xD;
      severity of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis among young-to-middle aged Pakistani men and&#xD;
      women free of clinical CVD, and 2) understand the impact, in terms of 5-year rates of CVD&#xD;
      events, of using the prognostic information provided by CCTA and the other study tests and&#xD;
      measurements to optimize cardiovascular prevention management in young-to-middle-aged&#xD;
      Pakistani adults.The secondary objectives of the study are to 1) determine the prevalence of&#xD;
      known and unknown diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      among young-to-middle aged Pakistani men and women free of clinical CVD; 2) identify the&#xD;
      determinants of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in this population; 3) estimate the&#xD;
      incidence of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular risk factors at 5&#xD;
      years of follow-up; 4) identify independent risk factors and markers of incident clinical CVD&#xD;
      among young asymptomatic Pakistanis; and 5) develop a 5-year risk score for the prediction of&#xD;
      incident CVD events in young-to-middle-aged Pakistani men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design PAK-SEHAT is an ongoing, observational, community-based, prospective cohort&#xD;
      study, with a target study population of 2,000 participants and a planned prospective follow&#xD;
      up of 5 years after study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Investigators plan to recruit 2,000 young-to-middle aged adult Pakistani men&#xD;
      and women with no known clinical ASCVD. Because the focus of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      prevalence, severity, and determinants of early coronary atherosclerosis in Pakistani adults,&#xD;
      focus will be on apparently healthy (i.e., without known clinical CVD) young-to-middle native&#xD;
      Pakistanis. Also, because premature coronary events are more frequent and usually observed at&#xD;
      younger ages in men than in women, the age range of male participants at enrollment will be&#xD;
      30-45 years, while this will be 45-55 years for female participants; and enrollment will use&#xD;
      a 3:1 male:female ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Strategy: PAK-SEHAT aims to be as representative as possible of the general&#xD;
      Pakistani population, and a multi-stage cluster sampling strategy will be used to identify&#xD;
      candidates to participate in the study. A cluster is defined as a Union Council (UC), which&#xD;
      is the smallest administrative division in Pakistan defined by the Government, with an&#xD;
      approximate population of 30,000 people each. The first stage of the sampling process occurs&#xD;
      at the province level, which is the largest administrative division in the country, and&#xD;
      participants will be recruited from all four Pakistani provinces and the Federal territory of&#xD;
      Islamabad. Next, districts will be selected, and within those, the UCs. Using the country's&#xD;
      most updated census data, one district from each province will be selected. Stratified&#xD;
      sampling will be done using rural and urban proportions declared by Pakistan's government.&#xD;
      The sampling of the districts will be stratified based on their rural and urban distribution,&#xD;
      which should be representative of the province's rural/urban proportion. Within each&#xD;
      district, one urban and one rural UC will be selected based on convenience. Households within&#xD;
      the UC will be selected by systematic sampling. The sampling interval will be calculated&#xD;
      using census data on population size and desired sample from each UC. The last stage is&#xD;
      participant selection from each household. Only one member of each will be allowed to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Enrollment Community based door-to-door surveying will be the primary method of&#xD;
      participant recruitment both in rural and urban areas. However, a critical first step will be&#xD;
      to identify the local stakeholders of the selected area/community. The research team will&#xD;
      arrange meetings with these leaders to inform them about the study and have their support to&#xD;
      work with the local community. Once engaged, those leaders will be asked to help disseminate&#xD;
      the study and contact individual participants for enrollment. Another important resource when&#xD;
      identifying and enrolling eligible participants are Government front-line health workers,&#xD;
      known as Lady Health Workers. These are residents of the area and their primary&#xD;
      responsibility is to provide preventive healthcare and promote health among women, men, and&#xD;
      children. They maintain logs of the residents living in their area of action and can serve as&#xD;
      a good resource to identify and reach potential participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the line-listing of potential candidates for participation, study personnel&#xD;
      will visit those individuals at their households and screen them for eligibility using a&#xD;
      structured questionnaire. Individuals who are deemed eligible to participate in the study&#xD;
      will be provided with detailed information about the study, invited to ask questions, and&#xD;
      asked to provide written informed consent for participation. If the potential participant is&#xD;
      not literate, then, in the presence of a family member, the consent form will be read to the&#xD;
      participant, and thumb impression will be taken for consent. The family member will serve as&#xD;
      witness and will provide the signature or the thumb impression (as appropriate) on the&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will undergo study measurements at mobile health set-up except first 100&#xD;
      participants. The first 100 participants will be from urban Sindh and will have their&#xD;
      measurements at the study hospital to have a dry run of the study procedures. It will help us&#xD;
      to identify the challenges in the study flow and to rectify them before starting the mobile&#xD;
      set-up. For rest of the participants, measurements will be taken at the mobile health set-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consenting, participants will be inquired about convenient times for them to visit the&#xD;
      mobile health set-up that will be used for data collection in those areas .Then, the study&#xD;
      team will visit the participants' households on the agreed time and bring them to the mobile&#xD;
      set-up. Participants will be brought in groups of 4-5 at a time to utilize working hours and&#xD;
      transport resources efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Evaluation Once enrolled, all participants will undergo a comprehensive set of&#xD;
      baseline evaluations, some of which will be repeated using identical methods during study&#xD;
      follow-up .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interview and questionnaires. Participants will be interviewed by trained study&#xD;
      personnel. Sociodemographic data, and information on past and present medical history, family&#xD;
      history, lifestyle will be collected using structured questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure and ankle-brachial index (ABI). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be&#xD;
      measured in each participant using a DINAMAP monitor (General Electric), With participants&#xD;
      sitting in a comfortable position for 5 minutes. Three readings will be taken and their&#xD;
      average will be used in subsequent analyses. Lying blood pressure will also be measured in&#xD;
      the participants' arms and legs and the ankle-brachial index will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry and body composition. Height (cm) will be measured through wall mounted&#xD;
      measuring tape. Body composition will be analyzed using the Tanita-MC-780 U body composition&#xD;
      analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood measurements and genetics. Trained study personnel will draw approximately 30 mL of&#xD;
      venous blood from each participant. Approximately 10 mL of blood will be biobanked and stored&#xD;
      at -80C to allow for future additional research studies, including genetic testing. The&#xD;
      latter will include but not limited to testing for ApoE Genotype (information about risk of&#xD;
      heart disease and response to amounts of dietary fat), 9p21 Genotype (risk of MI and CAD at&#xD;
      an early age), KIF6 Genotype (risk of heart disease and reduction of MACE with statins), LPA&#xD;
      Intron 25 (increased risk of heart disease), 4q25 A-Fib genotype (risk of atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      and risk of stroke due to atrial fibrillation). In participants who do not consent for&#xD;
      genetic testing, their 10 mL of biobanked blood may be used in non-genetic analyses but not&#xD;
      for studies involving genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac CT scans. Participants will first undergo a non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CT for&#xD;
      coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, followed by a contrast-enhanced CCTA. Toshiba Aquilion&#xD;
      Multislice CT scanners and prospective ECG triggering will be used. Participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated before the CT scan by study personnel and if the heart rate is above 65 bpm will be&#xD;
      pre-treated with a β-blocker (or ivabradine if contraindicated) to achieve a target heart&#xD;
      rate of ~60 bpm. Sublingual nitroglycerin will be administered as per standard protocols&#xD;
      approximately 3 minutes before the CCTA scan, and intravenous contrast will be injected at a&#xD;
      rate of 5.5-7 ml/s depending on the body habitus of the participant; for an average patient,&#xD;
      the dose of contrast is expected to be approximately 60-80 mL. The non-contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      images will be transferred to the Cardiology CT core lab at Tabba Heart Institute and&#xD;
      evaluated by trained radiologists who will quantify CAC according to Agatston's method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid ultrasound imaging . All participants will undergo carotid ultrasound imaging for&#xD;
      assessment of presence of carotid plaque and for carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT)&#xD;
      evaluation. This will be assessed with automated measurement over bilateral carotid arteries&#xD;
      using a Toshiba Aplio 500 ultrasound system (Otawara, Japan), using B-mode ultrasound&#xD;
      examination with a 10-MHz multi-frequency linear array transducer. Participants will be&#xD;
      examined in the supine position, and standard measurements will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline testing sequence. At the mobile set-up, first participants will undergo BP&#xD;
      measurement, ABI, anthropometric measurements, and body composition analysis, Then&#xD;
      participant will be prepared for CCTA. Blood specimens will be collected when canulated for&#xD;
      CCTA, then CCTA will be performed and then carotid ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data Management and Quality Study data will be collected in tablets and other&#xD;
      digital platforms and will be transferred periodically to a central server. The centralized&#xD;
      study database will be stored at the Tabba Heart Institute using a secure server, and data&#xD;
      privacy and confidentiality will be secured at all times. For quality control purposes, the&#xD;
      data collection application in the tablets will have in-built features to limit erroneous&#xD;
      data entry and inconsistency in recording of participant's responses. Also, a field&#xD;
      coordinator will monitor data collection and spot check 5-10% of the interviews. At the&#xD;
      centralized study database, data error reports will be generated on a monthly basis to&#xD;
      monitor completeness, invalid values, and inconsistencies in responses. In addition, a live&#xD;
      dashboard will be developed for pre-identified key variables to monitor and evaluate the&#xD;
      project's progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up and Event Ascertainment As part of the study follow-up, participants will be&#xD;
      contacted at 12, 30, and 60 months (5 years) after baseline. Besides repeat blood tests and&#xD;
      imaging testing at 30 and 60 months (Table 2), in each of the three follow-up visits a&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used to collect information on ASCVD outcomes. In case of an&#xD;
      affirmative answer, participants will be asked to provide additional evidence (e.g. hospital&#xD;
      admission records) so that the event can be confirmed. ASCVD events will include myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, unstable angina, stable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, coronary&#xD;
      revascularization, and cardiovascular death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published definitions will be used to define each of these incident events. An independent&#xD;
      Two cardiologists from the centralized PAK-SEHAT adjudication committee and blinded to the&#xD;
      results of the study tests will classify events as definite, probable, or absent, based&#xD;
      primarily on available hospital documentation. They will also classify CHD-, CVD- or stroke-&#xD;
      related deaths based on hospital records (if available) and verbal autopsy interviews with&#xD;
      families. If there is disagreement in event adjudication between the 2 assigned experts, a&#xD;
      third independent physician adjudicator will review the evidence to break the tie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The repeat CCTA at 60 months of follow-up will be used to evaluate the progression/regression&#xD;
      of coronary plaque burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses For analyses using baseline data, the frequency and distribution of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors (known, unknown), coronary plaque burden, and other key baseline&#xD;
      variables using number and frequency (%) for categorial variables and mean (standard&#xD;
      deviation) or median (interquartile range) for normally and not normally distributed&#xD;
      continuous variables will be described. Specifically for coronary plaque characteristics, the&#xD;
      CAC score will be categorized as 0, &gt;0-&lt;100, ≥100, and the distribution of CAC scores and&#xD;
      proportion of each stratum will be reported. With regards to CCTA findings, the proportion of&#xD;
      participants with any coronary plaque and the distribution of plaque subtypes will be&#xD;
      reported with 95% CI. Investigators will also report the frequency of having a maximal&#xD;
      coronary stenosis ≥50% and ≥70%, respectively, and the proportion of participants with&#xD;
      high-risk plaque features. The distributions of number of coronary vessels with plaque,&#xD;
      number of coronary segments affected per participant, and the location of coronary plaques&#xD;
      (left main, anterior descending, circumflex, and right coronary artery) will also be&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In analyses of incident events during follow-up, investigators will use standard survival&#xD;
      analysis and time-to-event techniques. Cumulative incidence at 5 years (in %) and incidence&#xD;
      rates per 1,000 person-years (with 95% CI) will be computed for the primary and secondary&#xD;
      study outcomes. The ASCVD event rates in the PAK-SEHAT population will be compared with those&#xD;
      of Pakistanis of the same age and sex free of clinical ASCVD and not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of incidence of cardiovascular risk factors during follow-up will be restricted to&#xD;
      individuals at-risk of each of those risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use Cox Proportional Hazards regression models to evaluate the association&#xD;
      between important baseline characteristics and incident ASCVD events during follow-up.&#xD;

        We plan to recruit 2,000 young-to-middle aged adult Pakistani men and women with no known&#xD;
        clinical ASCVD. Because the focus of this study is to investigate the prevalence, severity,&#xD;
        and determinants of early coronary atherosclerosis in Pakistani adults, we will focus on&#xD;
        apparently healthy (i.e., without known clinical CVD) young native Pakistanis. Also,&#xD;
        because premature coronary events are more frequent and usually observed at younger ages in&#xD;
        men than in women, the age range of male participants at enrollment will be 30-45 years,&#xD;
        while this will be 45-55 years for female participants; and enrollment will use a 3:1&#xD;
