      A retrospective and prospective, observational, non-interventional, cohort study to develop&#xD;
      quantitative metrics from tools used as standard of care when diagnosing, assessing and&#xD;
      monitoring patients with inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      that is without cure. It comprises two main disorders: Crohn's disease and ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis. These conditions can lead to debilitating symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss,&#xD;
      diarrhoea and rectal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is increasing worldwide and is increasingly&#xD;
      considered an emerging global disease. The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease is&#xD;
      currently the highest in North America and Western Europe and up to 600,000 people in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom are thought to be affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease is based on clinical, endoscopic,&#xD;
      radiological and histological features. Endoscopy, is considered the current gold standard in&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease with newer techniques being developed. There are however&#xD;
      limitations to these methods, especially regarding the inter and intra observer variability&#xD;
      in assessing the validated scoring systems used from the gold standard modalities.&#xD;

          1. Left sided, extensive or Pan-colonic Ulcerative colitis, undergoing flexible&#xD;
             sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. PaIleocolonic or colonic Crohn's disease undergoing flexible sigmoidoscopy or&#xD;
             colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Post-operative Crohn's disease undergoing colonoscopic assessment of surgical&#xD;
             anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ileal Crohn's disease undertaking or having previously undertaken small bowel CT or&#xD;
             MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Crohn's disease with perianal disease undergoing or having previously undertaking&#xD;
             pelvic MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A previous admission for acute severe ulcerative colitis&#xD;
