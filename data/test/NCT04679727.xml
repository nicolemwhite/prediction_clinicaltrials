    <textblock>
      Carotid artery disease is a main cause of ischemic stroke and vascular dementia, and a highly&#xD;
      prevalent disease. There is uncertainty about the optimal management of patients with&#xD;
      serendipitously or systematically detected asymptomatic carotid artery disease, due to the&#xD;
      paucity of information on the predictive features of serious vascular events. While percent&#xD;
      diameter stenosis is currently the accepted standard to decide about local interventions&#xD;
      (carotid artery stenting or endarterectomy), international guidelines also recommend the&#xD;
      evaluation of qualitative features of carotid artery disease as a guide to treatment. There&#xD;
      is, however, no agreement on which qualitative features are best predictors of events.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a role for metabolic plaque profile, local mechanical and hemorheologic factors&#xD;
      in triggering microembolization and silent ischemic events has been proposed from&#xD;
      experimental studies. This inadequate knowledge leads to a poor ability to identify patients&#xD;
      at higher risk and to an unwarranted dispersion of medical resources, lack of standardization&#xD;
      in diagnostic methods, and the use of expensive and resource-consuming techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against this background, the investigators aim at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospectively identifying the best predictors of (silent and overt) ischemic stroke and&#xD;
           vascular dementia in patients with asymptomatic subcritical carotid artery disease, by&#xD;
           identifying the non-invasive diagnostic features of the &quot;vulnerable carotid plaque&quot; as a&#xD;
           possible guide for optimal - local and systemic - treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transferring new ultrasound techniques possibly improving risk prediction to the&#xD;
           clinical field&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess whether &quot;smart&quot;, low-cost diagnostic methods, such as ultrasound-based&#xD;
           evaluations integrating established and advanced techniques, may yield at least the same&#xD;
           level of prospective information as more expensive and less cost-effective techniques.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      State of the art and preliminary data Stroke is a most relevant health burden, the second&#xD;
      most common cause of death and the third cause of disability worldwide. Stroke is a&#xD;
      heterogeneous disorder with several disease mechanisms implicated in its pathogenesis.&#xD;
      Ischemic stroke accounts for 87% of all stroke cases. The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute&#xD;
      Stroke Treatment) and the more recent SSS-TOAST (Stop Stroke Study TOAST) classifications&#xD;
      currently provide the most widely used schemes of stroke classification for clinicians.&#xD;
      Accordingly, pathomechanisms comprise: (a) large artery atherothrombosis (i.e., a major brain&#xD;
      artery or branch cortical artery); (b) cardioembolism; (c) small vessel occlusion (lacunar&#xD;
      infarcts); (d) other determined etiology (i.e., hypercoagulable states, hematologic&#xD;
      disorders); (e) undetermined etiology (cryptogenic embolism; incomplete patient evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silent stroke, usually defined as focal T2 hyperintensities &gt;3 mm with correlative T1&#xD;
      hypointensities at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has a reported incidence of 10-15% and a&#xD;
      relevant significance in terms of cognitive impairment and correlations with clinically overt&#xD;
      stroke. Silent stroke is a cerebrovascular ischemic (less frequently haemorrhagic) lesion&#xD;
      detected by neuroimaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that does not determine&#xD;
      acute focal neurological deficits but causes cerebral damage in an unaware way. Typically,&#xD;
      silent stroke (SS) affects regions associated with various mental processes, mood regulation&#xD;
      and cognitive functions, and therefore is a leading cause of vascular cognitive impairment&#xD;
      that impacts about one-third of individuals over the age of 70. Cerebral small vessel disease&#xD;
      related to aging (and possibly to age-related arterial stiffness) leading to leucoaraiosis&#xD;
      and lacunar infarctions is a main cause of SS, but also microembolic lesions due to atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation and carotid stenosis may be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of SS stroke may be challenging. In many cases, subjects are not diagnosed&#xD;
      until long after a stroke occurs or in case of progressive cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      Occasionally, strategic lesions in cerebral areas related to cognitive function, the&#xD;
      hippocampus or the thalamus, and, more frequently, incremental lesion load over time lead to&#xD;
      vascular dementia (VD). VD is is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. The prevalence of the illness is about 5% in Western countries. Current&#xD;
      epidemiologic research suggests that AF contributes to cognitive decline and dementia&#xD;
      independent of a history of stroke. Further work is warranted to elucidate the potential&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying this association, and better designed studies are needed to explore the&#xD;
      possible cognitive benefits of different therapeutic options in patients with carotid&#xD;
      disease. Potential pathophysiological pathways linking carotid disease with cognitive decline&#xD;
      are microembolism, systemic inflammation, and cerebral hypoperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a monocenter, prospective, longitudinal, observational study. This is a&#xD;
      no-profit study, granted by Regione Toscana - Bando Salute 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Eligible participants (see inclusion and exclusion criteria below) will be selected&#xD;
      and recruited in the outpatient setting of the UO Cardiologia 1 - AOUP. Exclusion and&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be evaluated according the previous medical history and imaging tests&#xD;
      of the participant. All participants identified as eligible will receive all the necessary&#xD;
      information about the study and will sign the informed consent under the supervision of the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator. In case of enrollment, a detailed plan will be prepared for each&#xD;
      participant to schedule the study evaluations to be integrated with the routine examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OUTCOMES Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different variables will be assessed and analyzed, in particular:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline neurological, psychological and neurocognitive evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline brain MRI evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Angio-MRI for carotid stenosis assessment and plaque tissue characterization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Angio-CT evaluation for carotid stenosis assessment and plaque characterization&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Multigate Doppler (MGD) Investigation of Carotid Artery Stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Carotid stenosis assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Wall shear rate and flow separation analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Advanced ultrasound techniques for plaque vulnerability and local mechanical properties&#xD;

           assessment of fibrous cap thickness, plaque deformation, and local arterial waveform and&#xD;
           stiffness&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow-up (2-years) brain MRI evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow-up (2 years) neurological, psychological and neurocognitive evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline neurological, psychological and neurocognitive evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each participant will be evaluated at baseline and at the 2-year follow-up with a&#xD;
           detailed medical history and physical examination. A detailed assessment of cognitive&#xD;
           decline/dementia will be performed as below detailed:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief screening tool wide used and sensitive&#xD;
           for mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, performing a subtests analysis of MoCA results&#xD;
           will allow to analyse performance visuospatial and executive functions, attention, and&#xD;
           recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adopting a more focus on specific cognitive functions, and following results of two&#xD;
                recent studies (The Tromso study - Mathiesen et al., 2004; Cheng et al., 2012) in&#xD;
                asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the investigators will also assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Working memory: Backward Digit Span&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Attention and psychomotor speed: Trail Making Test (Parts A and B)&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Motor functioning: Grooved Pegboard Test&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Memory: Verbal and Visual Paired Association (immediate and delayed recall -&#xD;
                subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Complex visuospatial perception: Modified Complex Figure Test (copy and&#xD;
                     recall)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Finally, it is also important to evaluate subjective dizziness and changes in&#xD;
                cognitive status, proved sensitive to carotid stenosis, using two brief self-report&#xD;
                questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • The Dizziness Handicap Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
                • The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The total assessment time will be around 30 minutes. The Clinical Psychology&#xD;
                     Unit will be responsible for preliminary tutorship of Centers about&#xD;
                     questionnaires administration, and subsequent centralized analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline brain MRI evaluation Silent brain infarction will be defined as focal T2&#xD;
           hyperintensity &gt;3 mm with correlative T1 hypointensities at MRI. This evaluation will be&#xD;
           matched with the similar 2-year follow-up examination, to assess the occurrence of&#xD;
           silent strokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Angio-MRI for carotid stenosis assessment and plaque tissue characterization Angio-MRI&#xD;
           of carotid arteries will be performed at baseline and after a two-year follow-up for&#xD;
           carotid plaque characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Angio-CT evaluation for carotid stenosis assessment and plaque characterization&#xD;
           Estimation of lumen stenosis and vessel anatomy with contrast agents. Specific&#xD;
           algorithms (quantitative evaluation of calcifications - lipid core - haemorrhage): the&#xD;
           two main CT techniques for plaque characterization here used will be multi-detector-row&#xD;
           CT and dual-source CT. Multi-detector-row CT will characterize plaque calcification,&#xD;
           ulcerations, fibrous plaque thickness, intra- plaque haemorrhage and the presence of&#xD;
           lipid-rich necrotic cores, based on voxel Hounsfield units density (HUs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Multigate Doppler (MGD) Investigation of Carotid Artery Stenosis The University of Pisa&#xD;
           has a long-standing collaboration with the Microeletronic System Design Lab (MSD-Lab) at&#xD;
           the Department of Informational Engineering (DINFO) of Florence University, based upon&#xD;
           an ultrasound advanced open platform (UlAOP) providing a detailed representation and&#xD;
           quantification of flow velocity profile and wall shear rate by means of multiple&#xD;
           spectral Doppler sample volumes (128) aligned perpendicularly through the longitudinal&#xD;
           arterial axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Carotid stenosis assessment A customized configuration developed in Florence will be&#xD;
           used to provide in real time a simplified flow velocity profile in common and internal&#xD;
           carotid artery, using 7 Doppler vectors aligned through the vessel transverse axis,&#xD;
           before, within and after the plaque. This approach allows to overcome the assumption of&#xD;
           a fully parabolic flow velocity profile through the vessel, which is instead variably&#xD;
           skewed in the presence of curvatures and stenosis. The correlation of central flow&#xD;
           velocity, peak flow velocity and flow velocity distribution with severity and shape of&#xD;
           carotid stenosis as assessed by angio-TC will be investigated. The association of flow&#xD;
           velocity values and skewness with MES and silent brain ischemic lesions will be also&#xD;
           assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b) Wall shear rate and flow separation analysis By post-processing of MGD datasets, wall&#xD;
           shear rate, oscillatory flow velocity patterns and retrograde flows will be estimated&#xD;
           using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The association of these parameters&#xD;
           with MES and baseline and incident silent brain ischemic lesions will be assessed. This&#xD;
           evaluation will be performed in a subset of 100 participants recruited in Pisa, no more&#xD;
           than 2 months after the angio-TC evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Advanced ultrasound techniques for plaque vulnerability and local mechanical properties&#xD;
           assessment After the baseline investigation, in a subset of participants, the ultrasound&#xD;
           investigation of carotid arteries and plaques will be repeated by US system providing&#xD;
           radiofrequency raw data for post-processing analysis. Conventional 2D US scan as well as&#xD;
           acquisition of the RF-data sets will be performed. Two-dimensional images will be&#xD;
           exploited for tissue characterization analysis; RF- datasets will be used to determine&#xD;
           fibrous cap thickness, local plaque deformation, arterial contour- wave analysis with&#xD;
           central pulsatile pressure and excess pressure estimate. This evaluation will be&#xD;
           performed at baseline no more than 2 months after the angio-TC evaluation, and then&#xD;
           repeated at the two-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Ultrasonographic markers of plaque composition Carotid plaque characterization will&#xD;
                be performed on 2D images at Lund University, by means of a customized software&#xD;
                recently validated against immunohistochemistry by Nilsson J and Goncalves I within&#xD;
                the context of a FP7 collaborative study on diabetes (IMI-SUMMIT project), with the&#xD;
                participation of the University of Pisa (Palombo C et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Validation of 3D US for carotid plaque stenosis severity and morphology assessment&#xD;
                Plaque volume and shape assessment (concentric/eccentric, regular, irregular) will&#xD;
                be assessed with a dedicated 3D probe implemented on a Philips cardiovascular US&#xD;
                platform in 50 participants. After acquisition of a 3D dataset (Fully Automated&#xD;
                Mechanical Transducer), including total plaque volume and maximum area reduction.&#xD;
                Total ulcer volume and size will be integrated. Off-line texture analysis will be&#xD;
                performed on a dedicated subset of images. Beside conventional 2D ultrasonographic&#xD;
                assessment of stenosis severity (including Doppler findings and 2D findings),&#xD;
                advanced ultrasonographic examinations will be performed with the aim of&#xD;
                quantitative data acquisition on tissue characterization, detection of&#xD;
                neovascularity, detection of total plaque burden (volume 3D), plaque deformation&#xD;
                and flow profiling. This subproject will be performed only at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Radiofrequency data for assessment of fibrous cap thickness, plaque deformation,&#xD;
                and local arterial waveform and stiffness The RF-dataset provided by the Esaote&#xD;
                systems will allow estimate of common carotid distensibility and plaque fibrous cap&#xD;
                thickness and deformation thanks to an array of 16 parallel lines crossing the&#xD;
                vessel longitudinal axis through 14 mm, with high spatial (10 μm) and temporal (660&#xD;
                Hz) resolution. A pressure- calibrated local arterial distension waveform is also&#xD;
                obtained, from which indices of local stiffness, pulsatile pressure, including the&#xD;
                so-called &quot;excess pressure&quot;, and wave reflection can be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow-up (2-years) brain MRI evaluation This examination will be performed at the&#xD;
           2-year follow-up and matched with the baseline examination, to assess new incident&#xD;
           events. Silent stroke will be similarly defined as focal T2 hyperintensity &gt;3 mm with&#xD;
           correlative T1 hypointensities at MRI. At this visit, MRI will be limited to the brain,&#xD;
           without carotid reassessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow-up (2 years) neurological, psychological and neurocognitive evaluation This will&#xD;
           be done with a complete physical examination and the use of dedicated scales to perform&#xD;
           an evaluation of signs of silent stroke or cerebral involution, as per item 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tools/equipment: questionnaires. Expected results: assessment of possible neuropsychologic&#xD;
      and cognitive status changes after two years + correlations between changes in&#xD;
      neuropsychologic and cognitive status after follow-up and MES, carotid plaque features, local&#xD;
      arterial mechanics, and atherosclerotic risk profile at baseline (longitudinal study) +&#xD;
      correlations between changes in neuropsychologic and cognitive status after follow-up and&#xD;
      changes in silent brain ischemic lesions (MRI), and in carotid plaque features and local&#xD;
      arterial mechanics by ultrasound, conventional and advanced (longitudinal study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT Data collection All variables listed above will be safely reported on the&#xD;
      case report form, collected and stored, including some self-reported questionnaires, i.e. the&#xD;
      Dizziness Handicap Inventory and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the&#xD;
      Elderly (IQCODE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management All data will be managed in compliance with the General Data Protection&#xD;
      Regulation (GDPR). A dedicated platform (Data Platform) in full compliance with the GDPR&#xD;
      rules and the Italian Legislative Decree no. 196 dated 30/06/2003 will be developed. Digital&#xD;
      and paper-based case report forms will be generated to collect participants' data. Data will&#xD;
      be then uploaded on the Data Platform for safe storing by using cloud technologies and&#xD;
      secured access credentials and protocols (TLS / HTTPS). All necessary measures to ensure full&#xD;
      protection of data will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pseudonymisation will be guaranteed by a secured alphanumeric code, whose key will be&#xD;
      password-protected and available only to the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data storage The principal investigator (Prof. Raffaele De Caterina) will be responsible for&#xD;
      data collection, management, storage and pseudonymisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Correlation and regression analysis will be performed in uni- and&#xD;
      multivariate manner, after correction for collinearity. Bland-Altman Analysis will assess the&#xD;
      predictive power and concordance of each methods for specific plaque features. Logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis, Cox regression analysis and survival analysis will be performed&#xD;
      according to different predictors, after determination of cut-off values for single&#xD;
      continuous variables. Incremental analysis (Chi-square; Net reclassification) will be&#xD;
      performed in order to assess the integrated value of combined (multi-imaging; soluble&#xD;
      biomarkers; clinical) methods. Finally, an inter- and intra-observer analysis will be&#xD;
      performed. A mathematical models combining the features derived from all the techniques used&#xD;
      to construct the best model predictive of stroke and the development of neurocognitive&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;

             clearly defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis higher than 60% will be enrolled&#xD;
             when revascularization by either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting will be&#xD;
             considered not indicated or not feasible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both genders (with capping implemented in order to ensure a 50±5% balance of males to&#xD;
             females),&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe comorbidities a priori precluding the 2-year follow-up (cachexia; end-stage&#xD;
             cancer; severe renal/respiratory insufficiency; advanced (class IV) heart failure;&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation and other significant arrhythmias).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe allergic diathesis; contraindications to contrast agents for angio-TC or MRI;&#xD;
             claustrophobia; presence of prostheses/implanted electronic devices not suitable for&#xD;
             MRI; lack of consent for any reason.&#xD;
