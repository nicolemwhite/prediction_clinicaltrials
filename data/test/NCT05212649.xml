  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability and timely selection of severe heart failure (HF) patients for cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation and advanced HF therapy is challenging. Peak VO2 by cardiopulmonary exercise&#xD;
      test (CPET) was used for transplant listing. This study aimed to reassess the prognostic&#xD;
      significance of peak VO2 and to compare that with the Heart Failure Survival Score in the&#xD;
      current optimized novel guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT).&#xD;

      Investigators retrospectively collected acute HF patients discharged alive from the hospital.&#xD;
      Investigators divided participants into more-GDMT (â‰¥2 kinds) and few-GDMT (&lt;2 kinds) groups&#xD;
      and compared the prognostic significance of peak VO2 and HFSS for combined all-cause&#xD;
      mortality and urgent cardiac transplantation.&#xD;

    <description>CPET was performed in this HF cohort within one month after being discharged and interpreted as previously described. Patients underwent an upright graded cycle ergometer exercise using a personalized ramp protocol or a motorized treadmill using a modified Bruce or Cornell protocol. Peak VO2 data measured by cycle ergometer were increased by 10% to allow a comparison between the two different procedures. Peak VO2 was defined as the highest 30-second average value obtained during exercise. Submaximal CPET variables such as ventilatory efficiency were calculated by the slope of VE versus VCO2 below the ventilatory compensatory point (VCP). If the slope of VE/VCO2 can't be calculated, we used the nadir of VE/VCO2, or the ratio of VE/VCO2 at the anaerobic threshold (AT) as the variable of ventilatory efficiency. The AT was determined by the V-slope method.</description>
