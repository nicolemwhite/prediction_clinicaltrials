  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation is the curative treatment for end-stage respiratory failure involving&#xD;
      highly selected patients. In 2018, the International Transplant Registry counts 69200 lung&#xD;
      transplants among 260 transplant centers. Between 2010 and June 2017, the 3-month survival&#xD;
      rate of patients after lung transplantation is 90%. The causes of early death are primary&#xD;
      graft failure, renal failure, infections, acute rejection (cellular or humoral), surgical&#xD;
      complications. The median survival is 6.7 years and the median conditioned survival at 1 year&#xD;
      is 8.9 years. Bronchiolitis obliterans is the leading cause of death after 1 year; it affects&#xD;
      10% more patients each year and peaks at 5 years at more than 50% of transplanted patients.&#xD;
      These results encourage transplant professionals to continue their efforts to improve the&#xD;
      prognosis of transplantation. Among these, the optimization of graft matching, taking into&#xD;
      account the characteristics of the donor and the recipient, constitute a relevant avenue of&#xD;
      study. Several donor characteristics seem to play a role in the prognosis of the transplant.&#xD;
      Survival at 12 months is significantly worse when the donor's age is greater than 50 years.&#xD;
      There does not appear to be a significant difference in donor cause of death. Recipients of a&#xD;
      graft exposed to smoking ≥ 20 pack-years have a 3% and 1.5% decreased survival at 1 and 5&#xD;
      years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, the 5-year survival of patients with conditional 1-year survival is poorer in case&#xD;
      of other toxic exposures such as alcohol, cocaine, crack or marijuana. Analysis of&#xD;
      international registry data also suggests a negative association between post-transplant&#xD;
      survival and donor hypertension and diabetes. However, the biological mechanisms by which&#xD;
      these factors affect survival remain unknown. Graft ischemia time is significantly associated&#xD;
      with survival with a 5-year survival of 70% and 65% for grafts exposed to ischemia ≥ 4 hours&#xD;
      or less. The cumulative effect of donor hypertension and ischemia time are appreciated by the&#xD;
      fact that the best postoperative survival is observed in donors without hypertension and&#xD;
      graft ischemia time ≥ 4 hours. Graft size is also associated with post-transplant prognosis,&#xD;
      in front of a significant decrease in survival for patients with emphysema, chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, transplanted with a smaller&#xD;
      graft size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This result is not found in patients transplanted for pulmonary fibrosis. One study has also&#xD;
      suggested the negative role of a gender mismatch between donor and recipient on&#xD;
      post-transplant survival, but there is currently no clear explanation for this result. The&#xD;
      presence of antibodies to the recipient's HLA system [DSA (donor-specific antibodies)] in&#xD;
      pre-transplant is a risk factor for hyperacute rejection and chronic graft dysfunction. Thus,&#xD;
      the choice of matching between the donor and the recipient appears complex in view of the&#xD;
      number of criteria to be taken into account which impact the duration of post-transplant&#xD;
      survival in the short and medium term. The objective of the project is to develop a decision&#xD;
      support tool, using artificial intelligence algorithms, to assist the thoracic surgeon in&#xD;
      identifying the patient, among those registered on the team's waiting list, who could benefit&#xD;
      most from a bi-pulmonary graft offered by the Biomedicine Agency.&#xD;
