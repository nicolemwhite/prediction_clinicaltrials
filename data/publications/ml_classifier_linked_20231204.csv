Background glucose-lowering/other cardiovascular therapies were unaltered for 6 months post-randomization unless clinically essential, facilitating comparison of EQW-associated effects in 14,665 evaluable participants self-identifying as White (n = 11,113), Asian (n = 1444), Black (n = 870), or Other Race (n = 1,238. Placebo-adjusted 6 month absolute changes in cardiometabolic variables were assessed using generalized linear models.Mean 6-month placebo-adjusted HbA1c reductions were similar in the four groups (range 0.54-0.67% [5.9 to 7.3 mmol/mol], P = 0.11 for race×treatment interaction), with no significant difference in Asians (reference) versus other groups after covariate adjustment (all P ≥ 0.10). Six-month placebo-adjusted mean changes in systolic (-1.8 to 0.0 mmHg) and diastolic (0.2 to 1.2 mmHg) blood pressure, serum LDL (- 0.06 to 0.02 mmol/L) and HDL (0.00 to 0.01 mmol/L) cholesterol, and serum triglycerides (-0.1 to 0.0 mmol/L) were similar in the racial groups (P ≥ 0.19 for race×treatment interaction and all P ≥ 0.13 for comparisons of Asians with other races). Resting pulse rate increased more in Asians (4 beats/min) than in other groups (≤ 3 beats/min, P = 0.016 for race×treatment interaction and all P ≤ 0.050 for comparisons of Asians with other races).Short-term cardiometabolic responses to EQW were similar in the main racial groups in EXSCEL, apart from a greater pulse rate increase in Asians.https://clinicaltrials.gov NCT01144338.© 2022.

Methods and Results Using data from the multi-ethnic Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, we used a case-cohort design to compare 1731 women with incident cardiovascular disease during follow-up to a cohort of 1914 women. The direction of effect of all 24 risk factors (including various apolipoproteins, hemoglobin A1c, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and tissue plasminogen activator antigen) was concordant for coronary heart disease (CHD, defined as myocardial infarction and CHD death) and ischemic stroke; however, associations were generally stronger with CHD. Significant differences for multiple risk factors, including blood pressure, lipid levels, and measures of inflammation, were observed when comparing the effects on hemorrhagic stroke with those on ischemic outcomes. For instance, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios per standard deviation increase in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 1.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.28) for CHD, 0.97 (0.88-1.07) for ischemic stroke, and 0.76 (0.63-0.91) for hemorrhagic stroke ( P<0.05 for equal association). Model discrimination was better for models predicting CHD or ischemic stroke than for models predicting hemorrhagic stroke or a combined end point. Conclusions Cardiovascular risk factors have largely similar effects on incidence of CHD and ischemic stroke in women, although the magnitude of association varies. Determinants of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke substantially differ, underscoring their distinct biology. Cardiovascular disease risk may be more accurately reflected when combined cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular outcomes are broken down into different first manifestations, or when restricted to ischemic outcomes.",NA,30/10/2018,D003160;D016428;D016448;D064888;D052061;D013485,10.1161/JAHA.117.007514,NA,1,1,,

In Australia, despite publically-funded testing and treatment, less than 15% of patients were treated in the first year of treatment access, highlighting the need for greater efficiency of health service delivery. To this end, non-invasive fibrosis algorithms were examined to reduce reliance on transient elastography (TE) which is currently utilised for the assessment of cirrhosis in most Australian clinical settings.This retrospective and prospective study, with derivation and validation cohorts, examined consecutive patients in a tertiary referral centre, a sexual health clinic, and a prison-based hepatitis program. The negative predictive value (NPV) of seven non-invasive algorithms were measured using published and newly derived cut-offs. The number of TEs avoided for each algorithm, or combination of algorithms, was determined.The 850 patients included 780 (92%) with HCV mono-infection, and 70 (8%) co-infected with HIV or hepatitis B. The mono-infected cohort included 612 men (79%), with an overall prevalence of cirrhosis of 16% (125/780). An 'APRI' algorithm cut-off of 1.0 had a 94% NPV (95%CI: 91-96%). Newly derived cut-offs of 'APRI' (0.49), 'FIB-4' (0.93) and 'GUCI' (0.5) algorithms each had NPVs of 99% (95%CI: 97-100%), allowing avoidance of TE in 40% (315/780), 40% (310/780) and 40% (298/749) respectively. When used in combination, NPV was retained and TE avoidance reached 54% (405/749), regardless of gender or co-infection.Non-invasive algorithms can reliably exclude cirrhosis in many patients, allowing improved efficiency of HCV assessment services in Australia and worldwide.",NA,14/02/2018,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1371/journal.pone.0192763,NA,1,1,,

This observational study describes decade-long trends (1999-2009) in the magnitude and characteristics of patients readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of hospitalization for an incident (initial) episode of NSTEMI.We reviewed the medical records of 2249 residents of the Worcester (Mass) metropolitan area who were hospitalized for an initial NSTEMI in 6 biennial periods between 1999 and 2009 at 3 central Massachusetts medical centers.The average age of our study population was 72 years, 90% were white, and 46% were women. The proportion of patients who were readmitted to the hospital for any cause within 30 days after discharge for an NSTEMI remained unchanged between 1999 and 2009 (approximately 15%) in both crude and multivariable adjusted analyses. Slight declines were observed for cardiovascular disease-related 30-day readmissions over the 10-year study period. Women, elderly patients, those with multiple chronic comorbidities or a prolonged index hospitalization, and patients who developed heart failure during their index hospitalization were at higher risk for being readmitted within 30 days than respective comparison groups.Thirty-day hospital readmission rates after hospital discharge for a first NSTEMI remained stable between 1999 and 2009. We identified several groups at higher risk for hospital readmission; further surveillance efforts and/or tailored educational and treatment approaches remain needed for these groups.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

PCT was measured daily for 14 days using an immuno-luminometric assay.We included 175 patients, 57 with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), 61 with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and 57 with hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). Initial PCT levels were higher in CAP than VAP patients (median (interquartile range: IQR); 2.4 (0.95 to 15.8) vs. 0.7 (0.3 to 2.15), ng/ml, P < 0.001) but not significantly different to HAP (2.2 (0.4 to 8.0) ng/ml).

The role of secondary cytoreductive surgery is unclear.We randomly assigned patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who had a first relapse after a platinum-free interval (an interval during which no platinum-based chemotherapy was used) of 6 months or more to undergo secondary cytoreductive surgery and then receive platinum-based chemotherapy or to receive platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Patients were eligible if they presented with a positive Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynäkologische Onkologie (AGO) score, defined as an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score of 0 (on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating greater disability), ascites of less than 500 ml, and complete resection at initial surgery. A positive AGO score is used to identify patients in whom a complete resection might be achieved. The primary end point was overall survival. We also assessed quality of life and prognostic factors for survival.A total of 407 patients underwent randomization: 206 were assigned to cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy, and 201 to chemotherapy alone. A complete resection was achieved in 75.5% of the patients in the surgery group who underwent the procedure. The median overall survival was 53.7 months in the surgery group and 46.0 months in the no-surgery group (hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.96; P = 0.02). Patients with a complete resection had the most favorable outcome, with a median overall survival of 61.9 months. A benefit from surgery was seen in all analyses in subgroups according to prognostic factors. Quality-of-life measures through 1 year of follow-up did not differ between the two groups, and we observed no perioperative mortality within 30 days after surgery.In women with recurrent ovarian cancer, cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy resulted in longer overall survival than chemotherapy alone.

However, the deleterious effect of nocturnal autonomic activation in elderly remains controversial.Subjects, all aged 65 years at baseline, were selected from the PROOF cohort study, a prospective observational cohort of subjects. Exclusion criteria were previous myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, type-1 diabetes, atrial fibrillation or anti-arrhythmic drug. Normotensive subjects were selected according to: 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements <135/85 mm Hg, absence of self-report antihypertensive treatment. Autonomic activation during sleep was evaluated from night-time ECG Holter recording. According the %VLFI (Very-Low Frequency component of Interbeat Interval Increment evaluated from heart rate variability analysis). Subjects with new-onset ambulatory hypertension were identified after two years when daytime ambulatory blood pressure was higher than 135/85 mm Hg or when they used an antihypertensive treatment.Among 428 normotensive subjects at inclusion, 62 (14.5%) were considered as hypertensives after two years. Univariate logistic regression model showed a significant association between abnormal %VLFI (>4%) and new-onset hypertension: OR = 1.78 (1.03-3.07). Male gender, increased body mass index and ambulatory systolic BP were also associated with increased risk of hypertension. After adjustment in the stepwise logistic regression, abnormal %VLFI was associated with an 82% increase in odds of new-onset hypertension, independently of systolic ABPM and body mass index.Repeated autonomic activation during sleep, whatever the origin of the phenomenon, may trigger hypertension development in the elderly.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Using propensity score (PS) methodology, we identified two subgroups of patients matched by 38 covariates and compared regarding 30-day survival (primary outcome). Interaction was investigated for age, sex, ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, AHF precipitated by an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), AHF classified as hypertensive or acute pulmonary edema (APE), and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) admission; mechanical ventilation; in-hospital, 3-day and 7-day mortality; and prolonged hospitalization (>7 days).Of 11,152 patients from the EAHFE (age (SD): 80 (10) years; 55.5% women), 718 (6.4%) were NIV+ and had a higher 30-day mortality (HR = 2.229; 95%CI = 1.861-2.670) (p < 0.001).

There is concern that patients with clinically aggressive disease may not have enrolled in recent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) trials due to the consent process and the inability to delay therapy for eligibility evaluation. We have examined the diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) and its association with clinical factors and outcome in a clinic-based observational cohort of patients with DLBCL from the United States. Validation of results was performed in an independent, clinical trial-based cohort from Europe. Patients and Methods Patients were prospectively enrolled in the University of Iowa and Mayo Clinic Specialized Programs of Research Excellence Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER; N = 986) or the Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) LNH-2003 clinical trials program (N = 1,444). All patients received anthracycline-based immunochemotherapy at initial diagnosis. Associations of DTI with clinical factors and outcome were examined. Outcome was assessed using event-free survival at 24 months from diagnosis (EFS24). Results Median (range) DTI was 15 days (0 to 155 days in the MER and 23 days (0 to 215 days) in LYSA. Shorter DTI was strongly associated with adverse clinical factors, including elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, poor performance status, B symptoms, and higher International Prognostic Index in both cohorts (all P < .001). Longer DTI was associated with improved EFS24 in both the MER (per-week odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74 to .0.87) and LYSA (per-week odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.94); association with EFS24 remained significant after adjustment for International Prognostic Index. Conclusion DTI is strongly associated with prognostic clinical factors and outcome in newly diagnosed DLBCL.

Twenty to thirty percent of obese youth have ""prediabetes,"" a precursor to diabetes marked by insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and impaired glucose tolerance. The Diabetes Prevention Program demonstrated that T2D could be prevented/delayed by intensive lifestyle modification in adults with prediabetes, but efficacy of similar interventions in youth has not been established. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of the Bright Bodies (BB) Healthy Lifestyle Program on 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose in comparison with adolescents receiving standard of care.A parallel-group randomized controlled trial comparing BB with standard clinical care (CC) in obese adolescents (10-16 years old, Tanner stage >2) with elevated OGTT 2-h blood glucose (130-199 mg/dL) from a racially/ethnically diverse population. OGTTs, including cardiovascular and anthropometric assessments, were conducted at baseline and 6 months. Children attended BB twice per week for exercise and nutrition/behavior modification, and the CC group received CC from their pediatrician.

We compared the D-dimer levels in VTE patients with distal and proximal clots.We conducted a multinational, prospective observational study of low-to-intermediate risk adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected VTE. Patients were classified as distal (calf DVT or sub-segmental PE) or proximal (proximal DVT or non-sub-segmental PE) clot groups and compared with univariate and multivariate analyses.Of 1752 patients with suspected DVT, 1561 (89.1%) had no DVT, 78 (4.4%) had a distal calf DVT, and 113 (6.4%) had a proximal DVT. DVT patients with proximal clots had higher D-dimer levels (3760 vs. 1670 mg/dL) than with distal clots. Sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for proximal DVT at an optimal D-dimer cutoff of 5770 mg/dL were 40.7% and 52.1% respectively. Of 1834 patients with suspected PE, 1726 (94.1%) had no PE, 7 (0.4%) had isolated sub-segmental PE, and 101 (5.5%) had non-sub-segmental PE. PE patients with proximal clots had higher D-dimer levels (4170 vs. 2520 mg/dL) than those with distal clots. Sensitivity and NPV for proximal PE at an optimal D-dimer cutoff of 3499 mg/dL were 57.4% and 10.4% respectively.VTE patients with proximal clots had higher D-dimer levels than patients with distal clots. However, D-dimer levels cannot be used alone to discriminate between VTE patients with distal or proximal clots.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of the current study was to develop a new patient-centered prognostic index for patients with advanced MDS by including self-reported fatigue severity into a well-established clinical risk classification: the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS).A total of 469 patients with advanced (ie, IPSS intermediate-2 or high-risk) MDS were analyzed. Untreated patients (280 patients) were recruited into an international prospective cohort observational study to create the index. The index then was applied to an independent cohort including pretreated patients with MDS from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts (189 patients). At baseline, patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30).A new prognostic index was developed: the FA-IPSS(h), in which FA stands for fatigue and h for higher-risk. This new risk classification enabled the authors to distinguish 3 subgroups of patients with distinct survival outcomes (ie, risk-1, risk-2, and risk-3). Patients classified as FA-IPSS(h) risk-1 had a median overall survival (OS) of 23 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 19-29 months), whereas those with risk-2 had a median OS of 16 months (95% CI, 12-17 months) and those with risk-3 had a median OS of 10 months (95% CI, 4-13 months). The predictive accuracy of this new index was higher than that of the IPSS alone in both the development cohort as well as in the independent cohort including pretreated patients.The FA-IPSS(h) is a novel patient-centered prognostic index that includes patients' self-reported fatigue severity. The authors believe its use might enhance physicians' ability to predict survival more accurately in patients with advanced MDS.

The hypothesis was that the combination of risk scores and plaque burden improved the discriminatory capacity for the diagnosis of ACS.The study was a subanalysis of the Rule Out Myocardial Infarction Using Computer-Assisted Tomography (ROMICAT) trial-a prospective observational cohort study. The authors enrolled patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of acute chest pain, inconclusive initial evaluation (negative biomarkers, nondiagnostic electrocardiogram [ECG]), and no history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients underwent contrast-enhanced 64-multidetector-row cardiac CT and received standard clinical care (serial ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and subsequent diagnostic testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear stress perfusion imaging, and/or invasive coronary angiography), as deemed clinically appropriate. The clinical providers were blinded to CT results. The chest pain score was calculated and the results were dichotomized to ≥10 (high-risk) and <10 (low-risk). Three risk scores were calculated, Goldman, Sanchis, and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), and each patient was assigned to a low-, intermediate-, or high-risk category. Because of the low number of subjects in the high-risk group, the intermediate- and high-risk groups were combined into one. CT images were evaluated for the presence of plaque in 17 coronary segments. Plaque burden was stratified into none, intermediate, and high (zero, one to four, and more than four segments with plaque). An outcome panel of two physicians (blinded to CT findings) established the primary outcome of ACS (defined as either an acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina) during the index hospitalization (from the presentation to the ED to the discharge from the hospital). Logistic regression modeling was performed to examine the association of risk scores and coronary plaque burden to the outcome of ACS. Unadjusted models were individually fitted for the coronary plaque burden and for Goldman, Sanchis, TIMI, and chest pain scores. In adjusted analyses, the authors tested whether the association between risk scores and ACS persisted after controlling for the coronary plaque burden. The prognostic discriminatory capacity of the risk scores and plaque burden for ACS was assessed using c-statistics. The differences in area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and c-statistics were tested by performing the -2 log likelihood ratio test of nested models. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Among 368 subjects, 31 (8%) subjects were diagnosed with ACS. Goldman (AUC = 0.61), Sanchis (AUC = 0.71), and TIMI (AUC = 0.63) had modest discriminatory capacity for the diagnosis of ACS. Plaque burden was the strongest predictor of ACS (AUC = 0.86; p < 0.05 for all comparisons with individual risk scores). The combination of plaque burden and risk scores improved prediction of ACS (plaque + Goldman AUC = 0.88, plaque + Sanchis AUC = 0.90, plaque + TIMI AUC = 0.88; p < 0.01 for all comparisons with coronary plaque burden alone).Risk scores (Goldman, Sanchis, TIMI) have modest discriminatory capacity and coronary plaque burden has good discriminatory capacity for the diagnosis of ACS in patients with acute chest pain. The combined information of risk scores and plaque burden significantly improves the discriminatory capacity for the diagnosis of ACS.© 2012 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.",K23 HL098370|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|K24 HL113128|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|R01 HL080053|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|T32 HL076136|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States,2/08/2012,D003160;D016428;D052061;D013485,10.1111/j.1553-2712.2012.01417.x,NA,1,1,,

This study has two aims: (1) identify the main patterns of recurrence and response to the treatments (2) evaluate pathologic complete response (pCR) and two-year disease-free survival (2yDFS) for overall survival (OS) and their potential to be relevant intermediate endpoints to predict.Pooled and treatment subgroup analyses were performed on five large European rectal cancer trials (2795 patients), who all received long-course radiotherapy with or without concomitant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. The ratio of distant metastasis (DM) and local recurrence (LR) rates was used to identify patient characteristics that increase the risk of recurrences.The DM/LR ratio decreased to a plateau in the first 2 years, revealing it to be a critical follow-up period. According to the patterns of recurrences, three patient groups were identified: 5-15% had pCR and were disease free after 2 years (excellent prognosis), 65-75% had no pCR but were disease free (good prognosis) and 15-30% had neither pCR nor 2yDFS (poor prognosis).Compared with pCR, 2yDFS is a stronger predictor of OS. To adapt treatment most efficiently, accurate prediction models should be developed for pCR to select patients for organ preservation and for 2yDFS to select patients for more intensified treatment strategies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The authors' goal was to identify factors associated with survival in nonasphyxia-related hypothermic cardiac arrest patients undergoing extracorporeal rewarming.All 38 cardiac surgery departments in Poland were encouraged to report consecutive hypothermic cardiac arrest patients treated with extracorporeal life support. All variables collected were analyzed in order to compare survivor and nonsurvivor groups. The parameters available at the initiation of extracorporeal rewarming were considered as potential predictors of survival in a logistic regression model. The primary outcome was survival to discharge from the intensive care unit. The secondary outcome was neurologic status.Multicenter retrospective study.Ninety-eight cases in the final analysis.All patients in nonasphyxia-related hypothermic cardiac arrest rewarmed with extracorporeal life support.The survival rate was 53.1%, and 94.2% of survivors had favorable neurologic outcome. The lowest reported core temperature with cerebral performance category scale 1 was 11.8°C. A univariate analysis identified 3 variables associated with survival, namely: age, initial arterial pH, and lactate concentration. In a multivariate analysis, 2 independent predictors of survival were age (0.957; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.924-0.991) and lactates (0.871; 95% CI 0.789-0.961). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for this fitted model was 0.71; 95% CI 0.602-0.817.Favorable survival with good neurologic outcome in nonasphyxiated hypothermic patients treated with extracorporeal life support was reported.

Recent reports suggest that DDX41MutGL myeloid malignancies could be considered as a distinct entity, even if their specific presentation and outcome remain to be defined. We describe here the clinical and biological features of 191 patients with DDX41MutGL AML. Baseline characteristics and outcome of 86 of these patients, treated with intensive chemotherapy in 5 prospective Acute Leukemia French Association/French Innovative Leukemia Organization trials, were compared with those of 1604 patients with DDX41 wild-type (DDX41WT) AML, representing a prevalence of 5%. Patients with DDX41MutGL AML were mostly male (75%), in their seventh decade, and with low leukocyte count (median, 2 × 109/L), low bone marrow blast infiltration (median, 33%), normal cytogenetics (75%), and few additional somatic mutations (median, 2). A second somatic DDX41 mutation (DDX41MutSom) was found in 82% of patients, and clonal architecture inference suggested that it could be the main driver for AML progression. DDX41MutGL patients displayed higher complete remission rates (94% vs 69%; P < .0001) and longer restricted mean overall survival censored at hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) than 2017 European LeukemiaNet intermediate/adverse (Int/Adv) DDX41WT patients (5-year difference in restricted mean survival times, 13.6 months; P < .001). Relapse rates censored at HSCT were lower at 1 year in DDX41MutGL patients (15% vs 44%) but later increased to be similar to Int/Adv DDX41WT patients at 3 years (82% vs 75%).

Known risk factors such as asparaginase dosing, older age and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have insufficient odds ratios to allow personalized asparaginase therapy. In this study, we explored machine learning strategies for prediction of individual AAP risk. We integrated information on age, sex, and SNPs based on Illumina Omni2.5exome-8 arrays of patients with childhood ALL (N=1564, 244 with AAP 1.0 to 17.9 yo) from 10 international ALL consortia into machine learning models including regression, random forest, AdaBoost and artificial neural networks. A model with only age and sex had area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.62. Inclusion of 6 pancreatitis candidate gene SNPs or 4 validated pancreatitis SNPs boosted ROC-AUC somewhat (0.67) while 30 SNPs, identified through our AAP genome-wide association study cohort, boosted performance (0.80). Most predictive features included rs10273639 (PRSS1-PRSS2), rs10436957 (CTRC), rs13228878 (PRSS1/PRSS2), rs1505495 (GALNTL6), rs4655107 (EPHB2) and age (1 to 7 y). Second AAP following asparaginase re-exposure was predicted with ROC-AUC: 0.65. The machine learning models assist individual-level risk assessment of AAP for future prevention trials, and may legitimize asparaginase re-exposure when AAP risk is predicted to be low.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Each subject had measurements of height, weight and waist circumference. A diabetes score was calculated from skin fluorescence measured on the left forearm. A finger prick was done to measure RCG and HbA1c (A1C). Health questionnaires were completed for the DRT. Increasing dysglycemia was defined as A1C ≥ 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or ≥ 6.0% (42 mmol/mol). Type 2 diabetes was defined as A1C ≥ 6.5% (47.5 mmol/mol).398 of 409 subjects had complete data for analysis with means for age, body mass index, and waist of 52 years, 27 kg/m(2) and 90 cm. 51% were male.

The correlation between BTMs and CTCs was also studied.In a 2-year observational, multicenter study, the levels of three BTMs (N- and C-terminal telopeptides of collagen I [NTX and αα-CTX], and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BSAP]) and CTCs were analyzed every three months. Patients received zoledronic acid (4mg every 28days) from the baseline visit.234 patients were analyzed. The levels of the BTMs were increased at baseline and significantly decreased after 3months (P<0.05). In the Cox regression univariate analyses significant hazard ratios (HRs) for death were found for pathological BSAP values at baseline (5.03 [95% CI: 1.214-20.839; P=0.0259]) and at 3months (3.41 [95% CI: 1.367-8.498; P=0.0085]).

Patients that sustain traumatic burn injuries may require computed tomography (CT) imaging as part of their initial trauma management. This multicenter retrospective chart review of patients admitted to two level I trauma centers with ≥10% TBSA burns between 2014 and 2017 aims to determine if patients with greater than 10% TBSA burns that received CT imaging with intravenous contrast were more likely to develop acute kidney injury during their admission. A total of 439 patients were included in the study. The average age was 45.3 years and average TBSA was 23.2%. Sixty-seven of the 439 patients underwent CT scans with IV contrast on admission. The rate of AKI between patients who did or did not receive CT scans was not statistically significant (9.1 vs 6.0%, P = 0.40). Patients who developed an AKI had higher TBSA (45.6 vs 21.1%, P < .01), amount of fluids per TBSA given within the first 24 hours (457.4 vs 321.6, P < .01), and mortality (71.1 vs 6.2%, P < .01) than those who did not develop an AKI. There was no significant difference in the development of acute kidney injury in burn patients who received CT scans with IV contrast on admission.

An overt DIC diagnosis using the ISTH DIC score calculated using FM was a predictor of non-survival at day 30, independently from overt DIC diagnosis based on scores calculated using FDP or DDi. The AUCROC values testing the ability of the ISTH DIC score to predict non-survival were 0·650, 0·624 and 0·602 using FM, DDi and FDP, respectively, as the FGM.

In personalized medicine, it is important to study the interaction between treatment and biomarkers in order to clearly identify patients that benefit from the treatment. With the local partial-likelihood estimation (LPLE) method proposed by Fan J, Lin H, Zhou Y. Local partial-likelihood estimation for lifetime data. The Annals of Statistics 2006; 34(1):290Ű325, the treatment effect can be modeled as a flexible function of the biomarker. In this paper, we propose a bootstrap test method for survival outcome data based on the LPLE, for assessing whether the treatment effect is a constant among all patients or varies as a function of the biomarker. The test method is called local partial-likelihood bootstrap (LPLB) and is developed by bootstrapping the martingale residuals. The test statistic measures the amount of change in treatment effects across the entire range of the biomarker and is derived based on asymptotic theories for martingales. The LPLB method is nonparametric and is shown in simulations and data analysis examples to be flexible enough to identify treatment effects in a biomarker-defined subset and more powerful to detect treatment-biomarker interaction of complex forms than the Cox regression model with a simple interaction. We use data from a breast cancer and a prostate cancer clinical trial to illustrate the proposed LPLB test.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",NA,19/06/2015,D016428;D013485,10.1002/sim.6563,NA,1,1,,

It is known that patients with PAD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention have a higher incidence of adverse cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or target vessel revascularization.In this study, we compared the detailed characteristics of culprit and nonculprit plaques between patients with and those without PAD using optical coherence tomography.We performed propensity score matching using the following variables: (i) age; (ii) sex; (iii) clinical presentation; (iv) diabetes mellitus; (v) hyperlipidemia; (vi) smoking; (vii) hypertension; (viii) BMI; and (ix) coronary lesion location. Finally, we matched 34 culprit lesions and 30 nonculprit lesions in patients with PAD to 68 culprit lesions and 60 nonculprit lesions in patients without PAD (1 : 2 ratio).In culprit lesions, PAD patients when compared with those without PAD had a higher prevalence of lipid-rich plaque (73.5 vs. 51.5%; P=0.033), higher lipid index (1744±1110 vs. 1246±656; P=0.043), calcification (79.4 vs. 58.8%; P=0.039), macrophage accumulation (70.6 vs. 48.5%; P=0.034), and cholesterol crystals (32.4 vs. 10.3%; P=0.006). In nonculprit lesions, PAD patients had a higher prevalence of calcification (76.7 vs. 55.0%; P=0.046), macrophage accumulation (63.3 vs. 38.3%; P=0.025), and cholesterol crystals (36.7 vs. 16.7%; P=0.034).Our study suggests greater coronary plaque vulnerability in both culprit and nonculprit lesions in patients with PAD.

Patients and Methods. A total of 120 patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this retrospective study. All patients were randomly assigned to a training dataset (n = 85) and test dataset (n = 35). According to the preprocessed F-FDG PET/CT image of each patient, a total of 384 radiomics features were extracted from the segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs). The Spearman correlation test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), after normalization on the features matrix, were applied to reduce the dimensionality of the features. Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to propose a model for predicting Ki67. The survival curve was used to explore the prognostic significance of radiomics features.A total of 62 Ki67 positive patients and 58 Ki67 negative patients formed the training set and test training dataset and test dataset. Radiomics signatures showed good performance in predicting the expression of Ki67 with AUCs of 0.86 (training dataset) and 0.85 (test dataset). Validation and calibration showed that the radiomics had a strong predictive power in patients with NSCLC survival, which was significantly close to the effect of Ki67 expression on the survival of patients with NSCLC.Radiomics signatures based on preoperative F-FDG PET/CT could distinguish the expression of Ki67, which also had a strong predictive performance for the survival outcome.Copyright © 2022 Wei Yao et al.",NA,29/03/2022,D016428;D016449,10.1155/2022/7761589,NA,1,1,,

Consensus is lacking regarding the optimal follow-up of cytologically proven benign lesions and sonographically nonsuspicious nodules. Current guidelines recommend serial ultrasound examinations and reassessment of cytology if significant growth is observed.To determine the frequency, magnitude, and factors associated with changes in thyroid nodule size.Prospective, multicenter, observational study involving 992 consecutive patients with 1 to 4 asymptomatic, sonographically or cytologically benign thyroid nodules. Patients were recruited from 8 hospital-based thyroid-disease referral centers in Italy between 2006 and 2008. Data collected during the first 5 years of follow-up, through January 2013, were analyzed.Baseline nodule growth (primary end point) was assessed with yearly thyroid ultrasound examinations. Size changes were considered significant for growth if an increase of 20% or more was recorded in at least 2 nodule diameters, with a minimum increase of 2 mm. Baseline factors associated with growth were identified. Secondary end points were the sonographic detection of new nodules and the diagnosis of thyroid cancer during follow-up.Nodule growth occurred in 153 patients (15.4% [95% CI, 14.3%-16.5%]). One hundred seventy-four of the 1567 original nodules (11.1% [95% CI, 10.3%-11.9%]) increased in size, with a mean 5-year largest diameter increase of 4.9 mm (95% CI, 4.2-5.5 mm), from 13.2 mm (95% CI, 12.1-14.2 mm) to 18.1 mm (95% CI, 16.7-19.4 mm).

In 184 individuals (18.5% [95% CI, 16.4%-20.9%]), nodules shrank spontaneously. Thyroid cancer was diagnosed in 5 original nodules (0.3% [95% CI, 0.0%-0.6%]). Only 2 had grown. An incidental cancer was found at thyroidectomy in a nonvisualized nodule. New nodules developed in 93 patients (9.3% [95% CI, 7.5%-11.1%]), with detection of one cancer.Among patients with asymptomatic, sonographically or cytologically benign thyroid nodules, the majority of nodules exhibited no significant size increase during 5 years of follow-up and thyroid cancer was rare.

A lack of defined standards may distort clinically relevant treatment effects.Systematic literature searches identified articles published between 2005 and 2009 reporting morbidity and mortality after esophagectomy for cancer. Data were analyzed for frequency of complication reporting and to check whether outcomes were defined and classified for severity and whether a validated system for grading complications was used. Information about reporting outcomes adjusting for baseline risk factors was collated, and a descriptive summary of the results of included outcomes was undertaken.Of 3458 abstracts, 224 full papers were reviewed and 122 were included (17 randomized trials and 105 observational studies), reporting outcomes of 57,299 esophagectomies. No single complication was reported in all papers, and 60 (60.6%) did not define any of the measured complications. Anastomotic leak was the most commonly reported morbidity, assessed in 80 (80.1%) articles, defined in 28 (28.3%), but 22 different descriptions were used.

Patient outcomes included 12-month target limb amputation (above ankle) and target limb revascularization as well as all-cause death. Kaplan-Meier analysis and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analysis of outcomes for the entire study sample as well as for the critical limb ischemia (CLI) and claudication subgroups. Results of the Cox regression models are reported as the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).Diabetics undergoing endovascular procedures had higher rates of comorbid conditions (p<0.001), CLI (p<0.001), heavily calcified lesions (p=0.002), multivessel disease (p=0.030), and fewer infrapopliteal runoff vessels (p<0.001). Regression analysis after adjusting for confounders revealed significantly higher target limb major amputation in diabetics compared with nondiabetics (HR 5.02, 95% CI 1.44 to 17.56, p=0.011). However, repeat revascularization rates were similar. When considering CLI and claudication subgroups, diabetes was associated with a nonsignificant increased risk of 12-month major amputation only for patients presenting with CLI (HR 3.48, 95% CI 0.97 to 12.51, p=0.056).

In liver transplantation (LTx), neither conventional liver function tests (LTFs) nor immunosuppressive drug monitoring are very effective for rejection monitoring. We therefore hypothesized that the quantitative measurement of donor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) would have independent value for the assessment of graft integrity, including damage from acute rejection.Traditional LFTs were performed and plasma GcfDNA was monitored in 115 adults post-LTx at three German transplant centers as part of a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort trial. GcfDNA percentage (graft cfDNA/total cfDNA) was measured using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), based on a limited number of predefined single nucleotide polymorphisms, enabling same-day turn-around. The same method was used to quantify blood microchimerism. GcfDNA was increased >50% on day 1 post-LTx, presumably from ischemia/reperfusion damage, but rapidly declined in patients without graft injury within 7 to 10 d to a median <10%, where it remained for the 1-y observation period. Of 115 patients, 107 provided samples that met preestablished criteria. In 31 samples taken from 17 patients during biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes, the percentage of GcfDNA was elevated substantially (median 29.6%, 95% CI 23.6%-41.0%) compared with that in 282 samples from 88 patients during stable periods (median 3.3%, 95% CI 2.9%-3.7%; p < 0.001). Only slightly higher values (median 5.9%, 95% CI 4.4%-10.3%) were found in 68 samples from 17 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive, rejection-free patients. LFTs had low overall correlations (r = 0.28-0.62) with GcfDNA and showed greater overlap between patient subgroups, especially between acute rejection and HCV+ patients. Multivariable logistic regression modeling demonstrated that GcfDNA provided additional LFT-independent information on graft integrity. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 90.3% (95% CI 74.2%-98.0%) and 92.9% (95% CI 89.3%-95.6%), respectively, for GcfDNA at a threshold value of 10%. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was higher for GcfDNA (97.1%, 95% CI 93.4%-100%) than for same-day conventional LFTs (AST: 95.7%; ALT: 95.2%; γ-GT: 94.5%; bilirubin: 82.6%). An evaluation of microchimerism revealed that the maximum donor DNA in circulating white blood cells was only 0.068%. GcfDNA percentage can be influenced by major changes in host cfDNA (e.g., due to leukopenia or leukocytosis). One limitation of our study is that exact time-matched GcfDNA and LFT samples were not available for all patient visits.In this study, determination of GcfDNA in plasma by ddPCR allowed for earlier and more sensitive discrimination of acute rejection in LTx patients as compared with conventional LFTs. Potential blood microchimerism was quantitatively low and had no significant influence on GcfDNA value. Further research, which should ideally include protocol biopsies, will be needed to establish the practical value of GcfDNA measurements in the management of LTx patients.",NA,26/04/2017,D016428;D016448;D064888;D013485,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002286,NA,1,1,,

Identifying and quantifying myocardial scar, which forms the substrate for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, may improve risk stratification.This study sought to determine whether the absence of myocardial scar detected by novel 12-lead electrocardiographic (ECG) Selvester QRS scoring criteria identifies patients with low risk for appropriate ICD shocks.We applied QRS scoring to 797 patients from the ICD arm of the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial. Patients were followed up for a median of 45.5 months for ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation treated by the ICD or sudden tachyarrhythmic death (combined group referred to as VT/VF).Increasing QRS score scar size predicted higher rates of VT/VF. Patients with no scar (QRS score = 0) represented a particularly low-risk cohort with 48% fewer VT/VF events than the rest of the population (absolute difference 11%; hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.88). QRS score scar absence versus presence remained a significant prognostic factor after controlling for 10 clinically relevant variables. Combining QRS score (scar absence versus presence) with ejection fraction (≥ 25% versus < 25%) distinguished low-, middle-, and high-risk subgroups with 73% fewer VT/VF events in the low-risk versus high-risk group (absolute difference 22%; hazard ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.62).Patients with no scar by QRS scoring have significantly fewer VT/VF events. This inexpensive 12-lead ECG tool provides unique, incremental prognostic information and should be considered in risk-stratifying algorithms for selecting patients for ICDs.Copyright © 2011 Heart Rhythm Society.

Using multiple sclerosis (MS) as a proof of principle, we showcased how to leverage routinely collected EHR data to identify patients with a complex neurological disorder and derive an important surrogate measure of disease severity heretofore only available in research settings.In a cross-sectional observational study, 5,495 MS patients were identified from the EHR systems of two major referral hospitals using an algorithm that includes codified and narrative information extracted using natural language processing. In the subset of patients who receive neurological care at a MS Center where disease measures have been collected, we used routinely collected EHR data to extract two aggregate indicators of MS severity of clinical relevance multiple sclerosis severity score (MSSS) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF, a measure of whole brain volume).The EHR algorithm that identifies MS patients has an area under the curve of 0.958, 83% sensitivity, 92% positive predictive value, and 89% negative predictive value when a 95% specificity threshold is used. The correlation between EHR-derived and true MSSS has a mean R(2) = 0.38±0.05, and that between EHR-derived and true BPF has a mean R(2) = 0.22±0.08. To illustrate its clinical relevance, derived MSSS captures the expected difference in disease severity between relapsing-remitting and progressive MS patients after adjusting for sex, age of symptom onset and disease duration (p = 1.56×10(-12)).Incorporation of sophisticated codified and narrative EHR data accurately identifies MS patients and provides estimation of a well-accepted indicator of MS severity that is widely used in research settings but not part of the routine medical records.

To address this challenge, we investigate the performance of the proposed machine learning (ML) methodology (based on the pre-treatment electroencephalogram (EEG)) for prediction of response to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication in subjects suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD).A relatively small number of most discriminating features are selected from a large group of candidate features extracted from the subject's pre-treatment EEG, using a machine learning procedure for feature selection. The selected features are fed into a classifier, which was realized as a mixture of factor analysis (MFA) model, whose output is the predicted response in the form of a likelihood value. This likelihood indicates the extent to which the subject belongs to the responder vs. non-responder classes. The overall method was evaluated using a ""leave-n-out"" randomized permutation cross-validation procedure.A list of discriminating EEG biomarkers (features) was found. The specificity of the proposed method is 80.9% while sensitivity is 94.9%, for an overall prediction accuracy of 87.9%. There is a 98.76% confidence that the estimated prediction rate is within the interval [75%, 100%].These results indicate that the proposed ML method holds considerable promise in predicting the efficacy of SSRI antidepressant therapy for MDD, based on a simple and cost-effective pre-treatment EEG.The proposed approach offers the potential to improve the treatment of major depression and to reduce health care costs.Copyright © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We evaluated the performance of the HEART score in patients of Caucasian, Chinese, Indian and Malay ethnicity.The HEART score was assessed retrospectively in 3456 patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome (1791 Caucasians, 1059 Chinese, 344 Indians, 262 Malays), assigning them into three risk categories.The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events within six weeks after presentation was similar between the ethnic groups. A smaller proportion of Caucasians was in the low risk category compared with Asians (Caucasians 35.8%, Chinese 43.5%, Indians 45.3%, Malays 44.7%, p<0.001). The negative predictive value of a low HEART score was comparable across the ethnic groups, but lower than previously reported (Caucasians 95.3%, Chinese 95.0%, Indians 96.2%, Malays 96.6%). Also the c-statistic for the HEART score was not significantly different between the groups.These results show that the overall performance of the HEART score is equal among Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups. The event rate in the low risk group, however, was higher than reported in previous studies, which queries the safety of early discharge of patients in the low risk category.",NA,1/04/2017,D016428;D016448,10.1177/2048872617700870,NA,1,1,0,

Outcomes in PALF reflect interactions among the child's clinical condition, response to supportive care, disease severity, potential for recovery, and, if needed, availability of a suitable organ for liver transplantation (LTx). Previously, we used computational analyses of immune/inflammatory mediators that identified three distinct dynamic network patterns of systemic inflammation in PALF associated with spontaneous survivors, non-survivors (NS), and LTx recipients. To date, there are no data exploring age-specific immune/inflammatory responses in PALF. Accordingly, we measured a number of clinical characteristics and PALF-associated systemic inflammatory mediators in daily serum samples collected over the first 7 days following enrollment from five distinct PALF cohorts (all spontaneous survivors without LTx): infants (INF, <1 year), toddlers (TOD, 1-2 years.), young children (YCH, 2-4 years), older children (OCH, 4-13 years) and adolescents (ADO, 13-18 years). Among those groups, we observed significant (P<0.05) differences in ALT, creatinine, Eotaxin, IFN-γ, IL-1RA, IL-1β, IL-2, sIL-2Rα, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TNF-α, and NO2-/NO3- . Dynamic Bayesian Network inference identified a common network motif with HMGB1 as a central node in all sub-groups, with MIG/CXCL9 being a central node in all groups except INF. Dynamic Network Analysis (DyNA) inferred different dynamic patterns and overall dynamic inflammatory network complexity as follows: OCH>INF>TOD>ADO>YCH. Hypothesizing that systemically elevated but sparsely connected inflammatory mediators represent pathological inflammation, we calculated the AuCon score (area under the curve derived from multiple measures over time divided by DyNA connectivity) for each mediator, and identified HMGB1, MIG, IP-10/CXCl10, sIL-2Rα, and MCP-1/CCL2 as potential correlates of PALF pathophysiology, largely in agreement with the results of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis. Since NS were in the INF age group, we compared NS to INF and found greater inflammatory coordination and dynamic network connectivity in NS vs. INF. HMGB1 was the sole central node in both INF and NS, though NS had more downstream nodes. Thus, multiple machine learning approaches were used to gain both basic and potentially translational insights into a complex inflammatory disease.Copyright © 2021 Vodovotz, Barclay, Yin, Squires and Zamora.",U01 DK072146|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|UL1 TR001857|NCATS NIH HHS|United States,2/02/2021,D003160;D016428;D016448;D064888;D052061,10.3389/fimmu.2020.610861,NA,1,1,,

The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic yield of magnifying flexible spectral imaging color enhancement (ME-FICE) plus pCLE for GIM detection.Sixty patients with previous histology confirmed as GIM underwent a surveillance EGD. Standard and 100× ME-FICE were used as a screening mode to depict GIM by light-blue crest, large long crest, and villous pattern criteria. Then, pCLE was followed to confirm the presence of GIM. In each patient, two biopsies were obtained from one positive area, and the other two were taken from the negative area. All specimens were interpreted by a clinically blinded pathologist. The reading results by ME-FICE and by ME-FICE plus pCLE were assessed for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), false-positive rate, false-negative rate, and accuracy.Of the 59 areas suspicious for GIM in 45 patients, 44 areas were confirmed as GIM by histology. The overall criteria from ME-FICE plus pCLE provided the highest sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, NPV, and accuracy at 96%, 90%, 86%, 97%, and 92%, respectively. There were two false-negatives (4%) and seven false-positives (10%). No early gastric cancer was detected in any.Combining ME-FICE with pCLE provides high sensitivity and NPV for GIM detection.

The Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group (KGOG) recently proposed new preoperative criteria to identify patients at low risk for lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer. In the multicenter study, serum carbohydrate antigen 125 levels and three magnetic resonance imaging parameters were found to be independent risk factors for nodal metastasis, and classified 53% of patients as part of a low-risk group. The false-negative predictive value (NPV) was 1.7%, and was 1.4% in the validation set. Furthermore, the KGOG low-risk criteria were validated in 319 Japanese patients with endometrial cancer. The criteria identified 181 of 319 patients as a low-risk group (51%), and three false-negative cases were found (1.9%). These results indicate that we are able to identify low-risk patients with a negligible NPV before surgery. In addition, the low false NPV implies that there is great difficulty in performing a randomized trial to determine the efficacy of routine lymphadenectomy in patients at low risk of lymph node metastasis. Based on these data, the challenges and possible solutions for developing a consensus on the optimized management of low-risk endometrial cancer will be discussed in this review.© 2014 The Authors.

The modified Erasmus GBS Outcome Score (mEGOS), developed with data from Dutch patients, is a clinical model that predicts the risk of walking inability in patients with GBS. The study objective was to validate the mEGOS in the International GBS Outcome Study (IGOS) cohort and to improve its performance and region specificity.We used prospective data from the first 1,500 patients included in IGOS, aged ≥6 years and unable to walk independently. We evaluated whether the mEGOS at entry and week 1 could predict the inability to walk unaided at 4 and 26 weeks in the full cohort and in regional subgroups, using 2 measures for model performance: (1) discrimination: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and (2) calibration: observed vs predicted probability of being unable to walk independently. To improve the model predictions, we recalibrated the model containing the overall mEGOS score, without changing the individual predictive factors. Finally, we assessed the predictive ability of the individual factors.For validation of mEGOS at entry, 809 patients were eligible (Europe/North America [n = 677], Asia [n = 76], other [n = 56]), and 671 for validation of mEGOS at week 1 (Europe/North America [n = 563], Asia [n = 65], other [n = 43]). AUC values were >0.7 in all regional subgroups. In the Europe/North America subgroup, observed outcomes were worse than predicted; in Asia, observed outcomes were better than predicted. Recalibration improved model accuracy and enabled the development of a region-specific version for Europe/North America (mEGOS-Eu/NA). Similar to the original mEGOS, severe limb weakness and higher age were the predominant predictors of poor outcome in the IGOS cohort.mEGOS is a validated tool to predict the inability to walk unaided at 4 and 26 weeks in patients with GBS, also in countries outside the Netherlands. We developed a region-specific version of mEGOS for patients from Europe/North America.This study provides Class II evidence that the mEGOS accurately predicts the inability to walk unaided at 4 and 26 weeks in patients with GBS.NCT01582763.© 2021 American Academy of Neurology.",MR/P008399/1|Medical Research Council|United Kingdom,24/12/2021,D000068397;D016428;D013485,10.1212/WNL.0000000000013139,NCT01582763,1,1,1,duplicate already NCT linked

Informative biomarkers could play a key role in early diagnosis. Prior case-control studies identified discriminatory salivary mRNA markers for OSCC. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) recommends prospective-specimencollection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) design study for rigorous biomarker identification and validation.A PRoBE design study enrolled 170 patients with lesions suspicious for OSCC. Saliva was collected before performing oral biopsy. Six pre-specified oral-cancer-associated mRNAs (IL1β, IL8, OAZ1, SAT, S100P, and DUSP1) and five housekeeping mRNAs (MT-ATP6, RPL30, RPL37A, RPL0, and RPS17) were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) without knowledge of tissue diagnosis. A pre-specified multi-marker panel from prior NCI - Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) studies was evaluated in this new PRoBE dataset. Individual marker cycle thresholds (Ct) from PCR were also compared in cancer versus control, and new discriminatory models were generated.The EDRN model was validated based on pre-specified statistical analysis plan. Ct values of individual mRNAs reflect an approximately twofold to nearly fourfold increase in concentration in invasive OSCC (P less than 0.01 for all). A new model from this intended-use population with incorporation of housekeeping genes demonstrates a maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity of 150.7% with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of over 0.85.The validation of six pre-specified individual salivary transcriptome markers of OSCC and a pre-specified multi-marker model in a new prospective population supports the robustness of these markers and the multi-marker methodology. New models generated in this intended-use population have the potential to further enhance the decision process for early biopsy. Lesions at very low risk for cancer could be identified noninvasively as could those at significantly increased risk. Further study is necessary to assure effective implementation of this technology into routine clinical practice.",NA,9/06/2015,D016430;D016428;D016448;D013485;D023361,NA,NA,1,1,,

Among 10 studies on prognosis, South Asians had better prognosis compared with white subjects (HR 0.78 95% CI 0.74 to 0.82).

However, prognosis was better in South Asians even among diabetics, older people and those living in areas of the highest social deprivation.South Asian ethnicity is associated with higher incidence of coronary disease, but lower mortality once coronary disease is manifest.

These studies have limited clinical applicability due to onerous scan frequency and lengthy study duration. Efficient methods are needed to reduce the required sample size, study duration, and sampling frequency in longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies. We develop a data-driven approach to identify parameters of study design for evaluation of longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers of multiple sclerosis lesion evolution. Our design strategies are considerably shorter than those described in previous studies, thus having the potential to lower costs of clinical trials. From a dataset of 36 multiple sclerosis patients with at least six monthly magnetic resonance imagings, we extracted new lesions and performed principal component analysis to estimate a biomarker that recapitulated lesion recovery. We tested the effect of multiple sclerosis disease modifying therapy on the lesion evolution index in three experimental designs and calculated sample sizes needed to appropriately power studies.

In docetaxel (DOC)-based chemotherapy, the frequency of febrile neutropenia (FN) and the G-CSF dose administered varied greatly between studies. Our study goal was to forecast the necessary dose of G-CSF by comparing day 8 neutropenia with putative changes within the neutrophil pool. We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of 242 early breast cancer patients who had received adjuvant DOC-based chemotherapy (DOC group) compared with 43 patients who had received FEC chemotherapy (FEC group). Patients who were given a standard dose and had a blood test on day 8 in the 1st cycle were eligible. In the DOC group, patients routinely received prophylactic administration of G-CSF (150 μg/body) on day 3 and received additional G-CSF based on a blood test on day 8. Results of the day 8 blood test showed that severe neutropenia (<500/mm3, average 494/mm3) was observed in 152 out of 242 (62.8%) patients in the DOC group, while in the FEC group (n = 43), neutropenia was ambiguous (average 1,741/mm3). In the FEC group, 9 out of 43 patients (20.9%) and in the DOC group, 27 out of 242 patients (11.1%) experienced FN. In the DOC group, day 8 neutropenia was predictive for FN in a logistic regression model (OR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.655-0.952], p = 0.013). Among 214 patients under 70 years old, the planned chemotherapy cycle was completed in 190 (88.8%) patients who also received the maximum dose of G-CSF (150 μg/body) four times, while 23 patients could not complete the planned chemotherapy cycle, but only five because of FN-related complications.

Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) can reliably detect microscopic lymph node metastasis. The object of this study was to establish whether the technique was both reliable in staging the N0 neck and a safe oncological procedure in patients with early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma.An European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-approved prospective, observational study commenced in 2005. Fourteen European centres recruited 415 patients with radiologically staged T1-T2N0 squamous cell carcinoma. SNB was undertaken with an average of 3.2 nodes removed per patient. Patients were excluded if the sentinel node (SN) could not be identified. A positive SN led to a neck dissection within 3 weeks. Analysis was performed at 3-year follow-up.An SN was found in 99.5% of cases. Positive SNs were found in 23% (94 in 415). A false-negative result occurred in 14% (15 in 109) of patients, of whom eight were subsequently rescued by salvage therapy. Recurrence after a positive SNB and subsequent neck dissection occurred in 22 patients, of which 16 (73%) were in the neck and just six patients were rescued. Only minor complications (3%) were reported following SNB. Disease-specific survival was 94%. The sensitivity of SNB was 86% and the negative predictive value 95%.These data show that SNB is a reliable and safe oncological technique for staging the clinically N0 neck in patients with T1 and T2 oral cancer.

Measures of VL are often used to predict different outcomes of interest in this population, such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. One popular approach to summarizing historical viral burden is the area under a time-VL curve (AUC). However, alternative historical VL summaries (HVS) may better answer the research question of interest. In this article, we discuss and contrast the AUC with alternative HVS, including the time-averaged AUC, duration of viremia, percentage of time with suppressed VL, peak VL, and age at peak VL. Using data on youth with perinatally acquired HIV infection from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study Adolescent Master Protocol, we show that HVS and their associations with full-scale intelligence quotient depend on when the VLs were measured. When VL measurements are incomplete, as can be the case in observational studies, analysis results may be subject to selection bias. To alleviate bias, we detail an imputation strategy, and we present a simulation study demonstrating that unbiased estimation of a historical VL summary is possible with a correctly specified imputation model.© Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 2022.

Graphical Markov (GM) model-based simulations and network clustering in 'R' package were conducted to identify correlations between clinical factors and outcomes. Factors shown to be associated with overall survival (OS) in the machine learning analysis were confirmed according to the clinical outcomes observed in the PMS.Among the 660 patients analyzed, median patient age was 70.0 years, and median OS and time-to-treatment failure (TTF) were 319 and 116 days, respectively. In GM-based simulations, factors associated with OS were liver metastases, performance status (PS), TTF, and neutropenia (threshold 0.05), and liver metastases, PS, and TTF (threshold 0.01). Factors associated with TTF were OS and relative dose intensity (threshold 0.05), and OS (threshold 0.01). In network clustering in 'R' package, factors associated with OS were number of treatment cycles, discontinuation due to disease progression, and TTF (threshold 0.05), and liver and lung metastases, PS, discontinuation due to adverse events, and febrile neutropenia (threshold 0.01). Kaplan-Meier analysis of patient subgroups demonstrated that visceral metastases and poor PS at baseline were associated with worse OS, while neutropenia or febrile neutropenia and higher number of cabazitaxel cycles were associated with better OS.Neutropenia may be a predictive factor for treatment efficacy in terms of survival. Poor PS and distant metastases to the liver and lungs were shown to be associated with worse outcomes, while factors related to treatment duration were shown to positively correlate with better OS.© 2022.

In the present study, a personalized measure of autism-related symptoms using the Youth Top Problems (YTP) method (Weisz et al., 2011) was evaluated. Participants included 68 children with diagnoses of autism (ages 6-13 years), and their parents, who were randomized to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or enhanced standard community treatment (ESCT) addressing autism-related symptoms. At pretreatment, parents described their child's top autism-related problems (YTPs) in their own words and rated the severity of these problems on a Likert-type scale. Parents also made daily severity ratings on the child's top three YTPs for 5 days prior to treatment and 5 days following treatment while videorecording their child's behavior at home on each of these days. Trained observers coded these videorecordings, focusing on the same YTPs that the parents rated. Parents also completed standardized checklists of autism-related symptoms and general mental health symptoms. There was evidence of convergent and discriminant validity as well as good test-retest reliability for the YTP measures. YTP severity scores converged with the standardized measure of autism-related symptoms. Parent-reported YTP scores predicted observers' YTP scores at the daily level, and both parent-reported and observers' YTP scores decreased from pre- to post treatment. Observers' ratings of the videorecordings exhibited sensitivity to treatment condition. These applications of the YTP method are promising and may complement standardized symptom checklists for clinical trials focusing on autism-related symptoms.

The aim of the present study was to investigate for the first time whether plasma untargeted metabolomic profiles, established from a simple blood draw from healthy women, could contribute to predict the risk of developing breast cancer within the following decade and to better understand the aetiology of this complex disease.A prospective nested case-control study was set up in the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) cohort, including 206 breast cancer cases diagnosed during a 13-year follow-up and 396 matched controls. Untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic profiles were established from baseline plasma samples. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were computed for each individual NMR variable and for combinations of variables derived by principal component analysis.Several metabolomic variables from 1D NMR spectroscopy were associated with breast cancer risk. Women characterized by higher fasting plasma levels of valine, lysine, arginine, glutamine, creatine, creatinine and glucose, and lower plasma levels of lipoproteins, lipids, glycoproteins, acetone, glycerol-derived compounds and unsaturated lipids had a higher risk of developing breast cancer.

Off-pump CABG (OPCABG) avoids postoperative complications from the cardiopulmonary bypass, but it is unclear how it is impacted by occult renal dysfunction (ORD). This study aimed to investigate the effects of ORD on early and late outcomes after OPCABG.This retrospective and observational cohort study reviewed data on 1,188 patients who underwent first isolated OPCABG with normal serum creatinine (SCr) levels. According to preoperative estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) by the Cockcroft-Gault formula, the patients were divided into an ORD group (n=260, eCrCl <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and a control group (n=928, eCrCl ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2).The ORD patients presented with older age, higher incidence of small body surface area, hypertension, low preoperative eCrCl, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Ⅲ, and high risk score. The prevalence of hospital mortality, postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), peak postoperative SCr, and prolonged hospital stay were greater in the ORD patients than the control patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the ORD patients were at significantly higher risk of postoperative AKI (OR, 2.702; 95% CI, 1.994-3.662) and in-hospital mortality (OR, 2.884; 95% CI, 1.293-6.432). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models confirmed that ORD was significantly associated with high later mortality (HR, 2.847; 95% CI, 1.262-6.425).Occult renal dysfunction is an independent risk factor for postoperative AKI in-hospital and later mortality in patients undergoing OPCABG with normal SCr levels.Copyright © 2020.

The measured umbilical artery-pulsatility index and middle cerebral artery-pulsatility index and their ratio were converted to multiples of the median after adjustment for gestational age. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether umbilical artery-pulsatility index, middle cerebral artery-pulsatility index, and cerebroplacental ratio improved the prediction of adverse perinatal outcome that was provided by maternal characteristics, medical history, and obstetric factors. The following outcome measures were considered: (1) adverse perinatal outcome consisting of stillbirth, neonatal death, or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy grades 2 and 3; (2) presence of surrogate markers of perinatal hypoxia consisting of umbilical arterial or venous cord blood pH ≤7 and ≤7.1, respectively, 5-minute Apgar score <7, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for >24 hours; (3) cesarean delivery for presumed fetal compromise in labor; and (4) neonatal birthweight less than the third percentile for gestational age.First, the incidence of adverse perinatal outcome, presence of surrogate markers of perinatal hypoxia, and cesarean delivery for presumed fetal compromise in labor was greater in pregnancies with small for gestational age neonates with birthweight <10th percentile compared with appropriate for gestational age neonates; however, 80%-85% of these adverse events occurred in the appropriate for gestational age group. Second, low cerebroplacental ratio <10th percentile was associated with increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome, presence of surrogate markers of perinatal hypoxia, cesarean delivery for presumed fetal compromise in labor, and birth of neonates with birthweight less than third percentile. However, multivariable regression analysis demonstrated that the prediction of these adverse outcomes by maternal demographic characteristics and medical history was only marginally improved by the addition of cerebroplacental ratio. Third, the performance of low cerebroplacental ratio in the prediction of each adverse outcome was poor, with detection rates of 13%-26% and a false-positive rate of about 10%. Fourth, the detection rates of adverse outcomes were greater in small for gestational age than in appropriate for gestational age babies and in pregnancies delivering within 2 weeks rather than at any stage after assessment; however, such increase in detection rates was accompanied by an increase in the false-positive rate. Fifth, in appropriate for gestational age neonates, the predictive accuracy of cerebroplacental ratio was low, with positive and negative likelihood ratios ranging from 1.21 to 1.82, and 0.92 to 0.98, respectively; although the accuracy was better in small for gestational age neonates, this was also low with positive likelihood ratios of 1.31-2.26 and negative likelihood ratios of 0.69-0.92. Similar values were obtained in fetuses classified as small for gestational age and appropriate for gestational age according to the estimated fetal weight.In pregnancies undergoing routine antenatal assessment at 35-37 weeks' gestation, measurement of cerebroplacental ratio provides poor prediction of adverse perinatal outcome in both small for gestational age and appropriate for gestational age fetuses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This can identify children who most need polysomnography (PSG) prior to adenotonsillectomy (AT).To assess whether a combination of factors, including demographics, physical examination findings, and caregiver reports from questionnaires, can predict different levels of OSAS severity in children.Baseline data from 453 children from the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy (CHAT) study were analyzed. Children 5.0 to 9.9 years of age with PSG-diagnosed OSAS, who were considered candidates for AT, were included.Polysomnography for diagnosis of OSAS.Linear or logistic regression models were fitted to identify which demographic, clinical, and caregiver reports were significantly associated with the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI).Race (African American), obesity (body mass index z score > 2), and the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) total score were associated with higher levels of AHI and ODI (P = .05). A multivariable model that included the most significant variables explained less than 3% of the variance in OSAS severity as measured by PSG outcomes. Tonsillar size and Friedman palate position were not associated with increased AHI or ODI. Models that tested for potential effect modification by race or obesity showed no evidence of interactions with any clinical measure, AHI, or ODI (P > .20 for all comparisons).This study of more than 450 children with OSAS identifies a number of clinical parameters that are associated with OSAS severity.

The HCMR (Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Registry) trial is a prospective natural history study of 2,755 patients with HCM with comprehensive phenotyping.All patients received yearly telephone follow-up. Major AF endpoints were defined as requiring electrical cardioversion, catheter ablation, hospitalization for >24 h, or clinical decisions to accept permanent AF. Penalized regression via elastic-net methodology identified the most important predictors of major AF endpoints from 46 variables. This was applied to 10 datasets, and the variables were ranked. Predictors that appeared in all 10 sets were then used in a Cox model for competing risks and analyzed as time to first event.Data from 2,631 (95.5%) patients were available for analysis after exclusions. A total of 127 major AF endpoints events occurred in 96 patients over 33.3 ± 12.4 months. In the final model, age, body mass index (BMI), left atrial (LA) volume index, LA contractile percent (active contraction), moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and history of arrhythmia the most important. BMI, LA volume index, and LA contractile percent were age-dependent. Obesity was a stronger risk factor in younger patients. Increased LA volume, reduced LA contractile percent, and moderate or severe MR put middle-aged and older adult patients at increased risk.The major predictors of major AF endpoints in HCM include older age, high BMI, moderate or severe MR, history of arrhythmia, increased LA volume, and reduced LA contractile percent.

Bacterial-induced host proteins such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6, are routinely used to support diagnosis of infection. However, their performance is negatively affected by inter-patient variability, including time from symptom onset, clinical syndrome, and pathogens. Our aim was to identify novel viral-induced host proteins that can complement bacterial-induced proteins to increase diagnostic accuracy. Initially, we conducted a bioinformatic screen to identify putative circulating host immune response proteins. The resulting 600 candidates were then quantitatively screened for diagnostic potential using blood samples from 1002 prospectively recruited patients with suspected acute infectious disease and controls with no apparent infection. For each patient, three independent physicians assigned a diagnosis based on comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigation including PCR for 21 pathogens yielding 319 bacterial, 334 viral, 112 control and 98 indeterminate diagnoses; 139 patients were excluded based on predetermined criteria. The best performing host-protein was TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 0.91), which was consistently up-regulated in viral infected patients. We further developed a multi-protein signature using logistic-regression on half of the patients and validated it on the remaining half. The signature with the highest precision included both viral- and bacterial-induced proteins: TRAIL, Interferon gamma-induced protein-10, and CRP (AUC of 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.96). The signature was superior to any of the individual proteins (P<0.001), as well as routinely used clinical parameters and their combinations (P<0.001). It remained robust across different physiological systems, times from symptom onset, and pathogens (AUCs 0.87-1.0).

This study shows that BSI predicts subsequent re-fracture in osteoporotic patients affected by fragility fractures.Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can provide quantitative (bone mineral density, BMD) and qualitative (trabecular bone score, TBS) indexes of bone status, able to predict fragility fractures in most osteoporotic patients. A new qualitative index of bone strength, based on finite element analysis and named bone strain index (BSI), has been recently developed from lumbar DXA scan. This study presents the validation results of BSI prediction for re-fracture in osteoporotic patients with fragility fractures.In three academic hospitals, 234 consecutive fractured patients with primary osteoporosis (209 females) performed a spine X-ray for the calculation of spine deformity index (SDI) and DXA densitometry for BMD, TBS and BSI at the basal time and in the follow-up at each clinical check. A subsequent fracture was considered as one unity increase of SDI.For each unit increase of the investigated indexes, the univariate hazard ratio of re-fracture, 95% CI, p value and proportionality test p value are for age 1.040, 1.017-1.064, 0.0007 and 0.2529, respectively, and for BSI 1.372, 1.038-1.813, 0.0261 and 0.5179, respectively.

In this work, we developed a predictive model of survival at 2 years. The model is based on a large volume of historical patient data and serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate the distributed learning approach.Clinical data from 698 lung cancer patients, treated with curative intent with chemoradiation or radiation therapy alone, were collected and stored at 2 different cancer institutes (559 patients at Maastro clinic (Netherlands) and 139 at Michigan university [United States]). The model was further validated on 196 patients originating from The Christie (United Kingdon). A Bayesian network model was adapted for distributed learning (the animation can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDJFOxpwqEA). Two-year posttreatment survival was chosen as the endpoint. The Maastro clinic cohort data are publicly available at https://www.cancerdata.org/publication/developing-and-validating-survival-prediction-model-nsclc-patients-through-distributed, and the developed models can be found at www.predictcancer.org.Variables included in the final model were T and N category, age, performance status, and total tumor dose. The model has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66 on the external validation set and an AUC of 0.62 on a 5-fold cross validation. A model based on the T and N category performed with an AUC of 0.47 on the validation set, significantly worse than our model (P<.001). Learning the model in a centralized or distributed fashion yields a minor difference on the probabilities of the conditional probability tables (0.6%); the discriminative performance of the models on the validation set is similar (P=.26).Distributed learning from federated databases allows learning of predictive models on data originating from multiple institutions while avoiding many of the data-sharing barriers. We believe that distributed learning is the future of sharing data in health care.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

While primarily designed to rule out NSTE-ACS safely, these algorithms can also be used for rule in of NSTE-ACS in some patients. Still, in a substantial number of patients, these algorithms do not provide a conclusive work-up. These patients often present with an atypical clinical profile and low-range positive hs-troponin values without a characteristic rise or fall pattern. They represent a heterogeneous group of patients with various underlying conditions; only a fraction (30%-40%) will eventually be diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. Uncertainty exists about the optimal diagnostic strategy and their management depends on the clinical perspective of the treating physician ranging from direct discharge to admission for invasive coronary angiography. Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is a non-invasive test that has been shown to be safe, fast and reliable in the evaluation of coronary artery disease. In this study, we will determine the usefulness of CCTA in patients with acute chest pain and low-range positive hs-troponin values.A prospective, double-blind, observational, multicentre study conducted in the Netherlands.

Patients first completed the validated symptom-based EoE activity index patient-reported outcome instrument and then underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with esophageal biopsy collection. Endoscopic and histologic findings were evaluated with a validated grading system and standardized instrument, respectively. Clinical remission was defined as symptom score <20 (range, 0-100); histologic remission was defined as a peak count of <20 eosinophils/mm(2) in a high-power field (corresponds to approximately <5 eosinophils/median high-power field); and endoscopic remission as absence of white exudates, moderate or severe rings, strictures, or combination of furrows and edema. We used receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the best symptom score cutoff values for detection of remission.Of the study subjects, 111 were in clinical remission (41.3%), 79 were in endoscopic remission (29.7%), and 75 were in histologic remission (27.9%). When the symptom score was used as a continuous variable, patients in endoscopic, histologic, and combined (endoscopic and histologic remission) remission were detected with area under the curve values of 0.67, 0.60, and 0.67, respectively. A symptom score of 20 identified patients in endoscopic remission with 65.1% accuracy and histologic remission with 62.1% accuracy; a symptom score of 15 identified patients with both types of remission with 67.7% accuracy.In patients with EoE, endoscopic or histologic remission can be identified with only modest accuracy based on symptoms alone. At any given time, physicians cannot rely on lack of symptoms to make assumptions about lack of biologic disease activity in adults with EoE.

Risk of ICU mortality was assessed with the PRISM score in both study and historical control groups. Descriptive statistics, standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with their 95% confidence intervals, and the calibration plots were reported.A total of 1,265 children admitted to 124 adult ICUs between 2003 and 2007 were compared with an historical control group formed by 1,533 children admitted to 26 PICUs between 1994 and 1995. The PRISM score slightly underestimated hospital deaths for low-risk patients in both groups. The overall SMR was 1.11 (95% CI 0.91-1.31) for adult ICUs and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.88-1.19) for PICUs.The level of care provided nowadays to children admitted to adult ICUs in Italy is similar to that provided by Italian PICUs 10 years earlier. On the other hand, there is evidence that Italian PICUs have improved the level of care in the same period.

A multicenter observational study of the RETAC (reseau européen de traîtement d'arrhythmies cardiaques)-group.,"Despite advances in interventional treatment strategies, atrial fibrillation (AF) remains associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Fibrotic atrial myopathy (FAM) is a main factor for adverse outcomes of AF-ablation, but complex to diagnose using current methods. We aimed to derive a scoring system based entirely on easily available clinical parameters to predict FAM and ablation-success in everyday care.In this multicenter, prospective study, a new risk stratification model termed AF-SCORE was derived in 220 patients undergoing high-density left-atrial(LA) voltage-mapping to quantify FAM. AF-SCORE was validated for FAM in an external mapping-validation cohort (n = 220) and for success following pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)-only (without adjunctive left- or right atrial ablations) in an external outcome-validation cohort (n = 518).FAM was rare in patients < 60 years (5.4%), but increased with ageing and affected 40.4% (59/146) of patients ≥ 60 years. Sex and AF-phenotype had additional predictive value in older patients and remained associated with FAM in multivariate models (odds ratio [OR] 6.194, p < 0.0001 for ≥ 60 years; OR 2.863, p < 0.0001 for female sex; OR 41.309, p < 0.0001 for AF-persistency). Additional clinical or diagnostic variables did not improve the model. AF-SCORE (+ 1 point for age ≥ 60 years and additional points for female sex [+ 1] and AF-persistency [+ 2]) showed good discrimination to detect FAM (c-statistic 0.792) and predicted arrhythmia-freedom following PVI (74.3%, 54.7% and 45.5% for AF-SCORE ≤ 2, 3 and 4, respectively, and hazard ratio [HR] 1.994 for AF-SCORE = 3 and HR 2.866 for AF-SCORE = 4, p < 0.001).Age, sex and AF-phenotype are the main determinants for the development of FAM. A low AF-SCORE ≤ 2 is found in paroxysmal AF-patients of any age and younger patients with persistent AF irrespective of sex, and associated with favorable outcomes of PVI-only. Freedom from arrhythmia remains unsatisfactory with AF-SCORE ≥ 3 as found in older patients, particularly females, with persistent AF, and future studies investigating adjunctive atrial ablations to PVI-only should focus on these groups of patients.© 2021.

Previous studies have shown that a host-protein signature consisting of TNF-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL), interferon-γ-induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP) can accurately differentiate bacterial from viral infections.This prospective, multicentre cohort study, entitled AutoPilot-Dx, aimed to validate signature performance and to estimate its potential impact on antibiotic use across a broad paediatric population (>90 days to 18 years) with respiratory tract infections, or fever without source, at emergency departments and wards in Italy and Germany. Infection aetiology was adjudicated by experts based on clinical and laboratory investigations, including multiplex PCR and follow-up data.In total, 1140 patients were recruited (February 2017-December 2018), of which 1008 met the eligibility criteria (mean age 3.5 years, 41.9% female). Viral and bacterial infections were adjudicated for 628 (85.8%) and 104 (14.2%) children, respectively; 276 patients were assigned an indeterminate reference standard outcome. For the 732 children with reference standard aetiology, the signature discriminated bacterial from viral infections with a sensitivity of 93.7% (95%CI 88.7-98.7), a specificity of 94.2% (92.2-96.1), positive predictive value of 73.0% (65.0-81.0), and negative predictive value of 98.9% (98.0-99.8); in 9.8% the test results were equivocal. The signature performed consistently across different patient subgroups and detected bacterial immune responses in viral PCR-positive patients.The findings validate the high diagnostic performance of the TRAIL/IP-10/CRP signature in a broad paediatric cohort, and support its potential to reduce antibiotic overuse in children with viral infections.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Prevalence and prognostic relevance: insights from the CARDIOTOX registry.,"The actual usefulness of cardiovascular (CV) risk factor assessment in the prognostic evaluation of cancer patients treated with cardiotoxic treatment remains largely unknown. Prospective multicentre study in patients scheduled to receive anticancer therapy related with moderate/high cardiotoxic risk.A total of 1324 patients underwent follow-up in a dedicated cardio-oncology clinic from April 2012 to October 2017. Special care was given to the identification and control of CV risk factors. Clinical data, blood samples, and echocardiographic parameters were prospectively collected according to protocol, at baseline before cancer therapy and then at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, and 2 years after initiation of cancer therapy. At baseline, 893 patients (67.4%) presented at least one risk factor, with a significant number of patients newly diagnosed during follow-up. Individual risk factors were not related with worse prognosis during a 2-year follow-up. However, a higher Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) was significantly associated with higher rates of severe cardiotoxicity (CTox) and all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.79 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.16-2.76) for SCORE 5-9 and HR 4.90 (95% CI 2.44-9.82) for SCORE ≥10 when compared with patients with lower SCORE (0-4)].This large cohort of patients treated with a potentially cardiotoxic regimen showed a significant prevalence of CV risk factors at baseline and significant incidence during follow-up. Baseline CV risk assessment using SCORE predicted severe CTox and all-cause mortality. Therefore, its use should be considered in the evaluation of cancer patients.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2020.

Based on all available patient baseline data (demographics, neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and MRI visual and computed ratings), the PredictND tool provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of the data with a likelihood index for five diagnostic groups; Alzheimer´s disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia and subjective cognitive decline. At baseline, a clinician defined an etiological diagnosis and confidence in the diagnosis, first without and subsequently with the PredictND tool. The follow-up diagnosis was used as the reference diagnosis.In total, 747 patients completed the follow-up visits (53% female, 69±10 years). The etiological diagnosis changed in 13% of all cases when using the PredictND tool, but the diagnostic accuracy did not change significantly. Confidence in the diagnosis, measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100%) increased (ΔVAS=3.0%, p<0.0001), especially in correctly changed diagnoses (ΔVAS=7.2%, p=0.0011).Adding the PredictND tool to the diagnostic evaluation affected the diagnosis and increased clinicians' confidence in the diagnosis indicating that CDSSs could aid clinicians in the differential diagnosis of dementia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.",NA,4/01/2019,D016428;D016448;D013485;D023361,10.2174/1567205016666190103152425,NA,1,1,,

The primary outcome was ARDS development within seven days. Of 500 patients enrolled, 464 patients were analysed, and 59 developed ARDS by day seven. Higher baseline and day one plasma sRAGE, but not esRAGE, were independently associated with increased ARDS risk. AGER SNP rs2070600 (Ser/Ser) was associated with increased ARDS risk and higher plasma sRAGE in this cohort, although confirmatory studies are needed to assess the role of AGER SNPs in ARDS prediction.

Currently, no trial and few prospective studies exist about this catastrophic event. The present review and meta-analysis aims to update information on clinical presentation, potential risk factors, treatment, and outcome of acute dissection during pregnancy and puerperium.A comprehensive search of three databases was performed to identify all patients reported in articles published from January 1987. A proportional single-arm meta-analysis with random-effects model was used to pool these variables: risk factors, pregnancy/postpartum occurrence, surgical characteristics, and outcomes.A total of 11 reports and 85 patients with pregnancy-related AAD were available for this study. The prevalence of connective tissue disorders was 62%, Marfan syndrome being the most common. Out of 76 patients, 46 (61%) had dissection during pregnancy and 30 (39%) during puerperium; 40% of events occurred in primigravidae and 60% in multigravidae. Type A and type B dissection occurred in 67% vs 33% of patients. Surgery was performed in 73% of cases with a maternal and fetal mortality of 23% and 27%, respectively.Throughout pregnancy, AAD is quite rare but fatal, especially in Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes, while isolated bicuspid aortic valve is not a risk factor. Even in Marfan syndrome, pathogenesis and evolution of the disease are still unclear.

Children not randomized (ineligible or clinician/parental choice) could participate in a parallel observational study. The primary outcome was the duration of symptoms rated moderately bad or worse. Throat swabs were taken and analyzed for the presence of bacteria and viruses by multiplex PCR.Swab results were available for most participants in the trial (306 of 432; 71%) and in the observational (182 of 326; 59%) studies. Bacterial pathogens potentially sensitive to amoxicillin (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae) were detected among 51% of the trial placebo group and 49% of the trial antibiotic group. The median difference in the duration of symptoms rated moderately bad or worse between antibiotic and placebo was similar when potentially antibiotic-susceptible bacteria were present (median: -1 day; 99% CI, -12.3 to 10.3) or not present (median: -1 day; 99% CI, -4.5 to 2.5). Furthermore, bacterial genome copy number did not predict benefit. There were similar findings for all secondary outcomes and when including the data from the observational study.There was no clear evidence that antibiotics improved clinical outcomes conditional on the presence or concentration of bacteria or viruses in the upper airway. Before deploying microbiologic point-of-care tests for children with uncomplicated LRTI in primary care, rigorous validating trials are needed.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

We aimed to describe body composition profile and examine the impact of nutritional status as well as independently and concurrently occurring body composition features on overall survival, treatment completion, unplanned admissions and length of stay (LOS) in patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) of curative intent for HNC.This work is a retrospective, observational study of patients who had completed treatment of curative intent for HNC. Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) was used to determine nutritional status. Tissue-density data were derived at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) with sarcopenia and myosteatosis defined by published, sex-specific threshold values stratified by body mass index for skeletal muscle index (cm2 /m2 ) and skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMR, Hounsfield Unit).Pre-treatment data (n = 277: 78% male, mean (SD) age 60 (13) years) revealed the prevalence of malnutrition (24.9%), sarcopenia (52.3%), myosteatosis (82.3%), and concurrently occurring sarcopenia and myosteatosis (39.7%). Malnutrition was independently associated with reduced OS for patients with moderate [hazard ratio (HR) 2.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-4.55, P = 0.001] and severe (HR 3.19; 95% CI 1.44-7.07, P = 0.004) malnutrition on multivariable analysis but not sarcopenia (HR 1.09; 95% CI 0.70-1.71), P = 0.700 or myosteatosis (HR 1.28; 95% CI 0.57-2.84), P = 0.500). Malnutrition was associated with treatment discontinuation (P < 0.001), not completing RT as planned (P < 0.001), unplanned hospital admission (P = 0.021), and greater LOS (P < 0.001). Skeletal muscle status features were associated with unplanned hospital admissions for those with no features (32%), with sarcopenia only (50%), myosteatosis only (25%), and concurrent sarcopenia and myosteatosis (50%), P < 0.001. Similarly, a clinically relevant greater median (Q1, Q3) LOS was observed for those with sarcopenia only [5 (3, 32)], myosteatosis only [10 (5, 30)], concurrent sarcopenia, and myosteatosis [14 (4, 33)] days vs. those with no features [3 (2, 11)] days, P = 0.2.Malnutrition was a more powerful prognostic indicator than CT-defined skeletal muscle depletion and was independently associated with reduced OS in patients undergoing RT or CRT of curative intent for HNC. CT-defined skeletal muscle depletion studies should recognize the multifaceted nature of human body composition and also measure nutritional status using validated methods in order to move towards developing a typology of high risk criteria for this complex patient group.© 2021 The Authors.

In the imatinib era few studies addressing the prognostic significance of the BCR-ABL1 transcript type in early chronic phase CML have been published. Overall, these studies suggest that in e14a2 patients the response to imatinib is faster and deeper. To evaluate if the BCR-ABL1 transcript type (e13a2 compared to e14a2) affect the response to imatinib and the clinical outcome in newly diagnosed adult CML patients, 559 patients enrolled in 3 prospective studies (NCT00514488, NCT00510926, observational study CML/023) were analyzed. A qualitative PCR was performed at baseline: 52% patients had a e14a2 transcript, 37% a e13a2 transcript, 11% co-expressed both transcripts and 1% had other rare transcripts. The median follow-up was 76 months (95% of the patients had at least a 5-year observation). The complete cytogenetic response rates were comparable in e14a2 and e13a2 patients. The median time to MR3.0 (6 and 12 months) and MR4.0 (41 and 61 months) was significantly shorter for e14a2 patients compared to e13a2 patients, with a higher cumulative probability of MR3.0 (88% and 83%, P < .001) and MR4.0 (67% and 52%, P = .001). The 7-year overall survival (90% and 83%, P = .017), progression-free survival (89% and 81%, P = .005) and failure-free survival (71% and 54%, P < .001) were significantly better in patients with e14a2 transcript. In conclusion, patients with e13a2 transcript had a slower molecular response with inferior response rates to imatinib and a poorer long-term outcome.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,4/05/2017,D016428;D016448,10.1002/ajh.24774,NA,1,1,,

For the first stage, blood samples were analysed on the i-STAT handheld device and the near patient blood gas analysers (GEM 4000 and OMNI S). Results were compared using Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman tests. For the second stage, we examined the differential reporting times of the POC device compared to the near patient blood gas analysers in two Scottish hospitals. Differential reporting times were assessed using Mann-Whitney test and descriptive statistics were reported with quartiles.Highly significant Pearson correlation coefficients (0.999 and 0.993 respectively) were found between i-STAT and GEM 4000 and OMNI S. The Bland-Altman agreement method showed bias values of -0.03 and -0.24, between i-STAT and GEM 4000 and OMNI S respectively. Median time from blood draw to i-STAT lactate results was 5 min (Q1-Q3 5-7). Median time from blood draw to GEM 4000 lactate results was 10 min (Q1-Q3 7.75-13).

This model was validated in a third San Antonio Biomarkers of Risk (SABOR) screening cohort.A prediction model for 1- to 5-year risk of developing PCa and Gleason > 7 PCa (HG PCa) was built on PLCO and SELECT using the Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for patient baseline characteristics. Random forests and neural networks were compared to Cox proportional hazard survival models, using the trial datasets for model building and the SABOR cohort for model evaluation. The most accurate prediction model is included in an online calculator.The respective rates of PCa were 8.9%, 7.2%, and 11.1% in PLCO (n = 31,495), SELECT (n = 35,507), and SABOR (n = 1790) over median follow-up of 11.7, 8.1 and 9.0 years. The Cox model showed higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA), BMI and age, and African American race to be associated with PCa and HGPCa. Five-year risk predictions from the combined SELECT and PLCO model effectively discriminated risk in the SABOR cohort with C-index 0.76 (95% CI [0.72, 0.79]) for PCa, and 0.74 (95% CI [0.65,0.83]) for HGPCa.A 1- to 5-year PCa risk prediction model developed from PLCO and SELECT was validated with SABOR and implemented online. This model can individualize and inform shared screening decisions.© 2022.

According to the Fear Avoidance Model, fear of movement and pain catastrophizing can influence the occurrence and maintenance of chronic pain complaints and functional disability. Primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal rehabilitation program in reducing functional disability for adolescents with CMP compared with care as usual.Pragmatic multicentre parallel group randomized controlled trial. Randomization by minimization (ratio 1:1) and treatment allocation will be concealed, computer-generated and performed by an independent organization. After randomization, data collection and researchers remain blinded. Inclusion of 124 adolescents and their parents is intended. This sample size is based on a 25 % difference in group mean on the primary outcome, with α = 5 %, β = 80 % and expected 15 % loss to follow up. Study population are adolescents (12-21 years) with CMP with an indication for outpatient rehabilitation treatment in the Netherlands. The intervention group receives a Multimodal Rehabilitation Program (MRP), a multidisciplinary outpatient individual rehabilitation program. MRP consists of 2 different treatment approaches: A graded exposure module or a combination module of graded exposure and physical training. Selection of a module depends on the needs of the patient. To both modules a parent module is added. The control group receives care as usual, which is the care currently provided in Dutch rehabilitation centres. Treatment duration varies between 7 and 16 weeks, depending on treatment allocation. Self-reported measurements are at baseline, and at 2, 4, 10 and 12 months after start of treatment. Intention to treat analysis for between group differences on all outcome variables will be performed. Primary outcome is functional disability (Functional Disability Inventory). Secondary outcome variables are fear of pain, catastrophizing, perceived harmfulness, pain intensity, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Total direct and indirect costs and health related quality of life will be measured. Process evaluation focuses on protocol adherence, patient centeredness and treatment expectations.A pragmatic approach was chosen, to ensure that results obtained are most applicable to daily practice.Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02181725 (7 February 2014).

While the monocyte monolayer assay (MMA) has been used to predict in vivo hemolysis when serologically incompatible blood may be transfused, it has also been shown to correlate with IVIG-associated hemolysis. In this study, the MMA was examined for its utility in assessing the risk of hemolysis after IVIG.Forty-two non-blood group O patients receiving high-dose IVIG (≥2 g/kg) were examined using an autologous and allogeneic MMA. Hemolysis was defined by a drop in hemoglobin of ≥1 g/L, a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and eluate, and a decrease in haptoglobin or increase in lactate dehydrogenase and/or reticulocytes.Forty-two patients provided 50 assessable postinfusion samples, with hemolysis observed in 20 (40%) of cases. Autologous MMA using post-IVIG red blood cells significantly correlated with clinical outcomes when compared to allogeneic MMA (P = .0320 vs .5806, t test). No significant difference in receiver operating characteristics was observed when comparing autologous MMA testing against DAT for the diagnosis of IVIG-associated hemolysis. However, when using samples collected 5 to 10 days after receipt of high-dose IVIG, the autologous MMA had higher sensitivity than the DAT.MMA testing with autologous monocytes collected 5 to 10 days after receipt of high-dose IVIG can be used for the diagnosis of IVIG-associated hemolysis and may be of particular value in cases in which the Day 5 to 10 DAT is negative.© 2020 AABB.","c(""Intramural grant"", ""Canadian Blood Services"", """")|c(""graduate fellowship program a"", ""Canadian Blood Services"", """")|c(""Health Canada"", """")",23/10/2020,D016430;D016428;D064888;D013485,10.1111/trf.16131,NA,1,1,,

However, previous studies are limited by a lack of follow-up genetic testing to confirm the outcomes and accurately assess test performance, particularly in women at a low risk for aneuploidy.To measure and compare the performance of cell-free DNA screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 between women at a low and high risk for aneuploidy in a large, prospective cohort with genetic confirmation of results STUDY DESIGN: This was a multicenter prospective observational study at 21 centers in 6 countries. Women who had single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based cell-free DNA screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 were enrolled. Genetic confirmation was obtained from prenatal or newborn DNA samples. The test performance and test failure (no-call) rates were assessed for the cohort, and women with low and high previous risks for aneuploidy were compared. An updated cell-free DNA algorithm blinded to the pregnancy outcome was also assessed.A total of 20,194 women were enrolled at a median gestational age of 12.6 weeks (interquartile range, 11.6-13.9). The genetic outcomes were confirmed in 17,851 cases (88.4%): 13,043 (73.1%) low-risk and 4808 (26.9%) high-risk cases for aneuploidy. Overall, 133 trisomies were diagnosed (100 trisomy 21; 18 trisomy 18; 15 trisomy 13). The cell-free DNA screen positive rate was lower in the low-risk vs the high-risk group (0.27% vs 2.2%; P<.0001). The sensitivity and specificity were similar between the groups. The positive predictive value for the low- and high-risk groups was 85.7% vs 97.5%; P=.058 for trisomy 21; 50.0% vs 81.3%; P=.283 for trisomy 18; and 62.5% vs 83.3; P=.58 for trisomy 13, respectively. Overall, 602 (3.4%) patients had no-call result after the first draw and 287 (1.61%) after including cases with a second draw. The trisomy rate was higher in the 287 cases with no-call results than patients with a result on a first draw (2.8% vs 0.7%; P=.001). The updated algorithm showed similar sensitivity and specificity to the study algorithm with a lower no-call rate.In women at a low risk for aneuploidy, single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based cell-free DNA has high sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value of 85.7% for trisomy 21 and 74.3% for the 3 common trisomies.

Study groups were defined as those transfused with either fresh frozen plasma/frozen plasma 24 hours or solvent detergent plasma. Outcomes were international normalized ratio reduction and ICU mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine independent associations.One hundred one PICUs in 21 countries.All critically ill children admitted to a participating unit were included if they received at least one plasma unit during six predefined 1-week (Monday to Friday) periods. All children were exclusively transfused with either fresh frozen plasma/frozen plasma 24 hours or solvent detergent plasma.None.There were 443 patients enrolled in the study. Twenty-four patients (5%) were excluded because no plasma type was recorded; the remaining 419 patients were analyzed. Fresh frozen plasma/frozen plasma 24 hours group included 357 patients, and the solvent detergent plasma group included 62 patients. The median (interquartile range) age and weight were 1 year (0.2-6.4) and 9.4 kg (4.0-21.1), respectively. There was no difference in reason for admission, severity of illness score, pretransfusion international normalized ratio, or lactate values; however, there was a difference in primary indication for plasma transfusion (p < 0.001).

However, this regimen has a lower biological effective dose (BED) compared with the Stupp regimen of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. It is hypothesized that accelerated hypofractionated radiation of 52.5 Gy in 15 fractions (BED equivalent to Stupp) is safe and efficacious.Elderly or frail patients with GBM treated with 52.5 Gy in 15 fractions were pooled from 3 phase 1/2 studies and a prospective observational study. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were defined time elapsing between surgery/biopsy and death from any cause or progression of disease.Sixty-two newly diagnosed patients were eligible for this pooled analysis of individual patient data. The majority (66%) had a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score <70. The median age was 73 years. The median OS and PFS were 10.3 and 6.9 months, respectively. Patients with KPS scores ≥70 and <70 had a median OS of 15.3 and 9.5 months, respectively. Concurrent chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for improved PFS and OS. Grade 3 neurologic toxicity was seen in 2 patients (3.2%). There was no grade 4/5 toxicity.This is the only analysis of elderly/frail patients with GBM prospectively treated with a hypofractionated radiation regimen that is isoeffective to the Stupp regimen.

We tested the hypothesis that intraoperative venous congestion is associated with AKI after cardiac surgery.In patients enrolled in the Statin AKI Cardiac Surgery trial, venous congestion was quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of central venous pressure (CVP) >12, 16, or 20 mm Hg during surgery (mm Hg min). AKI was defined using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria and urine concentrations of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 ([TIMP-2]⋅[IGFBP7]), a marker of renal stress. We measured associations between venous congestion, AKI and [TIMP-2]⋅[IGFBP7], adjusted for potential confounders. Values are reported as median (25th-75th percentile).Based on KDIGO criteria, 104 of 425 (24.5%) patients developed AKI.

In patients with unprovoked VTE, the risk is approximately 5% in the year following VTE diagnosis. Cancer-specific screening is therefore often considered in these patients, but the optimal screening strategy remains controversial. Recently, two risk classification scores have been proposed that may help in identifying patients at high risk of occult cancer in whom extensive screening may be warranted. In the present post hoc analysis of the Hokusai-VTE study, we evaluated the performance of the Registro Informatizado de Pacientes con Enfermedad TromboEmbólica (RIETE) and Screening for Occult Malignancy in Patients with Idiopathic Venous Thromboembolism (SOME) scores for occult cancer in patients with acute VTE. A total of 8,032 patients were included in the analysis of whom 218 (2.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-3.1) developed cancer between 30-day and 12-month follow-up.

A new prognostic model developed by the International T cell Project Network.","Different models to investigate the prognosis of peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) have been developed by means of retrospective analyses. Here we report on a new model designed on data from the prospective T Cell Project. Twelve covariates collected by the T Cell Project were analysed and a new model (T cell score), based on four covariates (serum albumin, performance status, stage and absolute neutrophil count) that maintained their prognostic value in multiple Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was proposed. Among patients registered in the T Cell Project, 311 PTCL-NOS were retained for study. At a median follow-up of 46 months, the median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 20 and 10 months, respectively. Three groups were identified at low risk (LR, 48 patients, 15%, score 0), intermediate risk (IR, 189 patients, 61%, score 1-2), and high risk (HiR, 74 patients, 24%, score 3-4), having a 3-year OS of 76% [95% confidence interval 61-88], 43% [35-51], and 11% [4-21], respectively (P < 0·001). Comparing the performance of the T cell score on OS to that of each of the previously developed models, it emerged that the new score had the best discriminant power. The new T cell score, based on clinical variables, identifies a group with very unfavourable outcomes.© 2018 The Authors.

The mean age at onset was 16.5 years (range, 0-58 years). Seventy-one patients (71/75 [94.7%]) were symptomatic at presentation; all had decreased best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Funduscopy findings were symmetric in 104 patients (104/108 [96.3%]), with the most common finding being macular schisis (82.4%), whereas peripheral retinoschisis was present in 38.9% and macular atrophy was present in 11.1%. Twenty patients (18.5%) demonstrated complications (vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, or both). Mean BCVA was 0.65 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR; Snellen equivalent, 20/89) in the right eye and 0.64 logMAR (Snellen equivalent, 20/87) in the left eye. Mean BCVA change over a mean interval of 6.7 years was 0.04 and 0.01 logMAR for right and left eyes, respectively. A normal FAF pattern was identified in 16 of 106 eyes (15.1%); 45 eyes (42.5%) showed a spoke-wheel pattern, 13 eyes (12.3%) showed foveal hyperautofluorescence, and 18 eyes (17.0%) showed a central reduction in signal. In total, 14 patients demonstrated evidence of progression on FAF over time. On OCT, foveoschisis was observed in 172 eyes (172/215 [80%]), parafoveal schisis was observed in 171 eyes (171/215 [79.5%]), and foveal atrophy was observed in 44 eyes (44/215 [20.5%]). Cystoid changes were localized to the inner nuclear layer (172/181 eyes [95%]), the outer nuclear layer (97/181 [53.6%]), and the ganglion cell layer (92/181 [50.8%]). Null variants were associated with worse final BCVA and aforementioned complications.X-linked retinoschisis is highly phenotypically variable, but with relative foveal and BCVA preservation until late adulthood, allowing more accurate prognostication. The slowly (often minimally) progressive disease course may pose a challenge in identification of early end points for therapeutic trials aimed at altering the kinetics of degeneration.Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

The Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Cellule Staminali e Terapie Cellulari, Italian Bone Marrow Donor Registry, and Associazione Italiana di Immunogenetica e Biologia dei Trapianti promoted a retrospective observational study to evaluate HLA matching and the impact of allelic HLA mismatching and non-HLA factors on unrelated Italian HSCT outcomes. From 2012 to 2015, 1788 patients were enrolled in the study. The average donor age was 29 years and the average recipient age was 49 years. As a conditioning regimen, 71% of the patients received myeloablative conditioning. For GVHD prophylaxis, 76% received either antithymocyte or anti-T lymphocyte globulin, cyclosporine A, and methotrexate. Peripheral blood was the stem cell source in 80%. The median duration of follow-up was 53 months. Regarding HLA matching, 50% of donor-recipient pairs were 10/10 matched, 38% had 1 mismatch, and 12% had 2 or more mismatches. A total of 302 pairs shared Italian origin. Four-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, GVHD-free relapse-free survival, and relapse rates were 49%, 40%, 22%, and 34%, respectively. The 4-year NRM was 27%, and the 100-day cumulative incidence of grade ≥II acute GVHD (aGVHD) was 26%. In multivariate analysis, 9/10 and ≤8/10 HLA allele-matched pairs were associated with worse OS (P = .04 and .007, respectively), NRM (P = .007 and P < .0001, respectively), and grade III-IV aGVHD (P = .0001 and .01, respectively). Moreover, the incidences of grade II-IV aGVHD (P = .001) and chronic GVHD (P = .002) were significantly lower in Italian pairs. In conclusion, 10/10 HLA matching is a favorable prognostic factor for unrelated HSCT outcome in the Italian population. Moreover, the presence of 2 HLA-mismatched loci was associated with a higher NRM (P < .0001) and grade II-IV aGVHD (P = .006) and a poorer OS (P = .001) compared with 1 HLA-mismatched locus in early or intermediate disease phases. Finally, we found that Italian donor and recipient origin is a favorable prognostic factor for GVHD occurrence.Copyright © 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

This study aims to assess Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Chinese patients with chronic HCV infection, and to identify significant predictors of the HRQoL in these patients of China.In this cross-sectional observational study, treatment-naïve Han ethnic adults with chronic HCV infection were enrolled. Adopting European Quality of Life scale (EQ-5D) and EuroQOL visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) were used to qualify HRQoL. Results were reported in descriptive analyses to describe sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to investigate the associations of these variables with HRQoL. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify associations of these variables with HRQoL by dimensions of EQ-5D.Nine hundred ninety-seven patients were enrolled in the study [median age 46.0 (37.0, 56.0) years; male 54.8%].

The purpose of this study was to analyze whether the foveal morphology assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography may serve as a prognostic indicator for best-corrected visual acuity in congenital aniridia patients.Observational two-center study performed between January 2012 and March 2017 in the pediatric ophthalmology department at Vissum Alicante and Vissum Madrid, Spain. A total of 31 eyes from 19 patients with congenital aniridia were included. After a complete ophthalmological examination, a high-resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography with a three-dimensional scan program macular protocol was used. A morphological grading system of foveal hypoplasia was used varying from grade 1 in which there is a presence of a shallow foveal pit, extrusion of inner retinal layers, outer nuclear layer widening, and a presence of outer segment lengthening to grade 4 in which none of these processes occur.No correlation between central, mid-peripheral, and peripheral macular thickness and logMAR best-corrected visual acuity was found. The presence of outer segment lengthening was associated with better best-corrected visual acuity with a median best-corrected visual acuity, 0.30 logMAR, whereas the absence of this morphologic feature was associated with poorer VA with a median best-corrected visual acuity of 0.61 logMAR (p < 0.001).Foveal hypoplasia morphology can predict the best-corrected visual acuity.

Random survival forest (RSF) and variable hunting methods were used to screen for radiomics features and LASSO-Cox regression analysis was used to build three models, including clinical only, radiomics only and combined clinical and radiomics models, which were evaluated by concordance index (CI) and calibration curve. Nomograms and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to display intuitive prediction information.Seven radiomics features were selected from 434 patients, combined with clinical features that were statistically significant to construct the predictive models of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The combined model showed the highest performance in both training and validation groups for predicting DFS ([CI], 0.714, 0.729) and OS ([CI], 0.730, 0.712). DCA showed that the net benefit of the combined model and of the clinical model is significantly greater than that of the radiomics model alone at different threshold probabilities.We demonstrated that a combined predictive model based on MR Rad-S and clinical risk factors had better predictive efficacy than the radiomics models alone for patients with ESCC.• Magnetic resonance-based radiomics features combined with clinical risk factors can predict survival in patients with ESCC. • The radiomics nomogram can be used clinically to predict patient recurrence, DFS, and OS. • Magnetic resonance imaging is highly reproducible in visualizing lesions and contouring the whole tumor.© 2022.

However, noninvasive MRI offers advantages of improved spatial resolution, allowing hemodynamic changes to be compared directly with structural findings and without concerns related to ionizing radiation exposure. The aim of this study was to evaluate relationships between CCD identified from cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI with cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)-weighted blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI, Wallerian degeneration, clinical motor impairment, and corticospinal tract involvement.Subjects (n=74) enrolled in an ongoing observational stroke trial underwent CBF-weighted ASL and hypercapnic CVR-weighted BOLD MRI. Hemispheric asymmetry indices for basal cerebellar CBF, cerebellar CVR, and cerebral peduncular area were compared between subjects with unilateral supratentorial infarcts (n=18) and control subjects without infarcts (n=16). CCD required (1) supratentorial infarct and (2) asymmetric cerebellar CBF (>95% confidence interval relative to controls).In CCD subjects (n=9), CVR (p=0.04) and cerebral peduncular area (p<0.01) were significantly asymmetric compared to controls. Compared to infarct subjects not meeting CCD criteria (n=9), CCD subjects had no difference in corticospinal tract location for infarct (p=1.0) or motor impairment (p=0.08).CCD correlated with cerebellar CVR asymmetry and Wallerian degeneration. These findings suggest that noninvasive MRI may be a useful alternative to PET or SPECT to study structural correlates and clinical consequences of CCD following supratentorial stroke.Copyright © 2015.

A prototype of a novel APDS (""KoloPol,"" Fraunhofer IIS, Erlangen, Germany) was used for automated image-based polyp detection. The software functions by highlighting structures of possible polyp lesions in a color-coded manner during real-time colonoscopy procedures. Testing the feasibility of APDS deployment under real-time conditions was the primary goal of the study. APDS polyp detection rates (PDRs) were defined as secondary endpoints provided that endoscopists' detection served as criterion standard.The APDS was applied in 55 routine colonoscopies without the occurrence of any clinically relevant adverse events. Endoscopists' PDRs and ADRs were 56.4% and 30.9%, respectively. The PDRs and ADRs of the APDS were 50.9% and 29.1%, respectively. The APDS detected 55 of 73 polyps (75.3%). Smaller polyp size and flat polyp morphology were correlated with insufficient polyp detection by the APDS.Computer-assisted automated low-delay polyp detection is feasible during real-time colonoscopy. Efforts should be undertaken to improve the APDS with respect to smaller and flat shaped polyps.

We aimed to describe body composition profile and examine the impact of nutritional status as well as independently and concurrently occurring body composition features on overall survival, treatment completion, unplanned admissions and length of stay (LOS) in patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) of curative intent for HNC.This work is a retrospective, observational study of patients who had completed treatment of curative intent for HNC. Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) was used to determine nutritional status. Tissue-density data were derived at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) with sarcopenia and myosteatosis defined by published, sex-specific threshold values stratified by body mass index for skeletal muscle index (cm2 /m2 ) and skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMR, Hounsfield Unit).Pre-treatment data (n = 277: 78% male, mean (SD) age 60 (13) years) revealed the prevalence of malnutrition (24.9%), sarcopenia (52.3%), myosteatosis (82.3%), and concurrently occurring sarcopenia and myosteatosis (39.7%). Malnutrition was independently associated with reduced OS for patients with moderate [hazard ratio (HR) 2.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-4.55, P = 0.001] and severe (HR 3.19; 95% CI 1.44-7.07, P = 0.004) malnutrition on multivariable analysis but not sarcopenia (HR 1.09; 95% CI 0.70-1.71), P = 0.700 or myosteatosis (HR 1.28; 95% CI 0.57-2.84), P = 0.500). Malnutrition was associated with treatment discontinuation (P < 0.001), not completing RT as planned (P < 0.001), unplanned hospital admission (P = 0.021), and greater LOS (P < 0.001). Skeletal muscle status features were associated with unplanned hospital admissions for those with no features (32%), with sarcopenia only (50%), myosteatosis only (25%), and concurrent sarcopenia and myosteatosis (50%), P < 0.001. Similarly, a clinically relevant greater median (Q1, Q3) LOS was observed for those with sarcopenia only [5 (3, 32)], myosteatosis only [10 (5, 30)], concurrent sarcopenia, and myosteatosis [14 (4, 33)] days vs. those with no features [3 (2, 11)] days, P = 0.2.Malnutrition was a more powerful prognostic indicator than CT-defined skeletal muscle depletion and was independently associated with reduced OS in patients undergoing RT or CRT of curative intent for HNC. CT-defined skeletal muscle depletion studies should recognize the multifaceted nature of human body composition and also measure nutritional status using validated methods in order to move towards developing a typology of high risk criteria for this complex patient group.© 2021 The Authors.

The uniqueness of the current Japanese CKD-MBD guidelines lies in the lower target range of intact parathyroid hormone levels than those used in other countries, which is based on analyses of the nationwide Japan Renal Data Registry. Cohort studies were also useful in exploring risk factors of renal outcome in predialysis patients. It was revealed that low vitamin D status (very prevalent in Japan) and high fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels predict poor renal outcome. The reported association of FGF23 levels with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and heart failure observed in cohort studies may support the idea of adding the 4th component of CKD-MBD, namely, ""LVH"" to the three original components. When it is not feasible to conduct RCTs regarding intervention, we have no choice but to rely on observational studies with sophisticated analysis methods, such as facility-level analysis and marginal structural model minimizing indication bias. Observational studies conducted in Japan revealed that the side effects of medications for CKD-MBD, resultant compliance, and effective doses in terms of hard outcome in Japanese patients were found to be different from those in other countries. For example, the MBD-5D study confirmed the benefit of cinacalcet in terms of mortality despite its median dose of only 25 mg/day. These data are very helpful for future guidelines specific to Japanese patients with CKD.",NA,13/12/2016,D016428;D016454,10.1007/s10157-016-1367-4,NA,1,1,,

However, the heterogeneity of systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and diastolic blood pressure variability (DBPV) for different vascular events remains unclear. This study aims to investigate whether SBPV or DBPV has different contribution to vascular events in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (IS) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).Data from the BOSS (blood pressure and clinical outcome in TIA or IS) study were examined for vascular events at 3-month and 1-year follow-up. BPV was defined as the SD and coefficient of variation (CV) of day-to-day measurements within 3 months after IS/TIA. Vascular events include cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cardiac death and congestive heart failure) and cerebrovascular events (ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke). Logistic regression model was used to test the associations between BPV and vascular events.Of 2325 patients with IS or TIA, 103 (4.43 %) experienced a recurrent stroke and 64 (2.75 %) had cardiovascular events within 3 months. Day-to-day SBPV was only associated with stroke recurrence (BPVSD: OR, 1.72, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.71; BPVCV: 1.86, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.92), but not cardiovascular events (BPVSD: 1.67, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.94; BPVCV: 1.51, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.64). However, DBPV seems to be related to both stroke (BPVSD: 1.60, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.49; BPVCV: 1.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.37) and cardiovascular events (BPVSD: 2.48, 95% CI 1.37 to 4.48; BPVCV: 1.92, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.36). Similar results were found at 1 year.For patients with IS/TIA, stroke recurrence was associated with both SBPV and DBPV; however, cardiovascular events seem to be only related to DBPV.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Careful patient selection for this therapy is crucial, but unfortunately very little information from randomised controlled trials is available to guide clinical decision-making. Consequently, data from real-world patient registries play a more important role in this context.A retrospective observational study was conducted at the University Hospital of Zurich and the GZO Regional Healthcare Centre in Wetzikon. Clinical databases were screened for patients with a history of WCD use from the time of its approval in Switzerland in July 2014 until February 2018. Baseline characteristics, WCD data and outcome data, with an emphasis on ICD implantation and ICD therapies, were collected and analysed.Two-hundred and seven patients were included in the primary analysis. Eighty-six percent were male and the mean age was 58 &plusmn; 13 years. The underlying heart disease was ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) and congenital/inherited heart diseases in 60, 35 and 5%, respectively. The most common indication for WCD use was heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) <35% due to ICM or NICM (43 and 27%, respectively). Three of the 207 patients received an appropriate shock over a median WCD wear-time of 62 days (interquartile range [IQR] 35&ndash;95). No inappropriate shocks were registered. Median average daily wear-time was 22.6 hours (IQR 19.9&ndash;23.2) and was significantly shorter for patients for whom WCD discontinuation was due to comfort issues (17 patients, p = 0.003). After the end of WCD therapy, 48% were implanted with an ICD. In those receiving an ICD, the rate of appropriate ICD therapies (either shock or antitachycardia pacing) was 8% during a median follow-up of 110 days (IQR 23&ndash;421).The WCD is safe and effective in terminating malignant ventricular arrhythmias. A substantial subgroup of patients, however, discontinued WCD use prematurely because of comfort issues. This subset of patients deserves further attention in clinical practice to ensure therapy adherence. &nbsp.",NA,11/11/2019,D016428;D064888,10.4414/smw.2019.20136,NA,1,1,,

Participants were aged 40-70 years, had a family history of early onset CAD, and a 5-year ACVDR of 2-15%.CT coronary artery calcium score greater than zero (any coronary calcification) or greater than 100 (calcification warranting lipid therapy).1059 participants were recruited; 477 (45%) had non-zero coronary artery calcium scores (median 5-year ACVDR, 4.8% [IQR, 2.9-7.6%]; median coronary artery calcium score, 41.7 [IQR, 8-124]); 582 (55%) did not (median 5-year ACVDR, 3.2% [IQR, 2.0-4.6%]). Of 151 participants with calcium scores of 100 or more, 116 (77%) were deemed to be at low cardiovascular risk by Australian guidelines, while 14 of 75 participants at intermediate risk (19%) had zero calcium scores. The sensitivity of the ACVDR calculator for identifying people with non-zero calcium scores (area under receiver operator curve [AUC], 0.674) was lower than that of the pooled cohort equation (AUC, 0.711; P < 0.001). ACVDR (10-year)- and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)-predicted risk categories concurred for 511 participants (48%); classifications were concordant for 925 participants (87%) when the ACVDR was supplemented by calcium scores.Coronary artery calcium scoring should be considered as part of the heart health check for patients at intermediate ACVDR risk and with family histories of early onset CAD.

Our primary goal is to implement a single-blind, randomized control trial (RCT) designed to compare the effectiveness of an 8-week home-based telerehab virtual reality (VR) program with conventional therapy in PwMS with manual dexterity difficulties. Secondary aims include (a) evaluating the impact of the programs on quality of life after the intervention and a follow-up 1 month later and (b) evaluating the impact of the programs on adherence and satisfaction.Twenty-four PwMS will be recruited to the study which will be conducted at two established MS centers: (1) The Regional Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, Binaghi Hospital, Cagliari, Italy, and (2) The Multiple Sclerosis Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. Participants will complete a total of three assessments focusing on upper limb functions. Both groups will receive 16 training sessions focusing on functional upper limb activities. The home-based telerehab VR intervention will comprise a custom-made software program running on a private computer or laptop. PwMS will perform several activities of daily living (ADL) functions associated with self-care, dressing, and meal preparation. Conventional therapy will focus on task-related upper-limb treatments while in a sitting position, indicative of the standard care in MS. Following 8 weeks of training, participants will complete a further outcome assessment. The same tests will be conducted 1 month (as a follow-up) after completion of the intervention.The outcomes of this study have tremendous potential to improve the quality of evidence and informed decisions of functional upper limb activities in PwMS. If comparable results are found between the treatments in improving upper limb outcomes, this would suggest that PwMS can choose the program that best meets their personal needs, e.g., financial concerns, transportation, or accessibility issues. Secondly, this information can be used by healthcare providers and medical professionals in developing upper limb exercise programs that will most likely succeed in PwMS.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04032431 .

Understanding the optimal means to interpret these elevated biomarkers in patients presenting with acute dyspnea remains unknown.Concentrations of NT-proBNP, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 were analyzed in 1448 patients presenting with acute dyspnea from the prospective, multicenter International Collaborative of NT-proBNP-Re-evaluation of Acute Diagnostic Cut-Offs in the Emergency Department (ICON-RELOADED) Study. Eight biogroups were derived based upon patterns in biomarker elevation at presentation and compared for differences in baseline characteristics. Of 441 patients with elevations in all 3 biomarkers, 218 (49.4%) were diagnosed with acute heart failure (HF). The frequency of acute HF diagnosis in this biogroup was higher than those with elevations in 2 biomarkers (18.8%, 44 of 234), 1 biomarker (3.8%, 10 of 260), or no elevated biomarkers (0.4%, 2 of 513). The absolute number of elevated biomarkers on admission was prognostic of the composite end point of mortality and HF rehospitalization. In adjusted models, patients with one, 2, and 3 elevated biomarkers had 3.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-11.1, P = .017), 12.3 (95% CI, 4.60-32.9, P < .001), and 12.6 (95% CI, 4.54-35.0, P < .001) fold increased risk of 180-day mortality or HF rehospitalization.A multimarker panel of NT-proBNP, hsTnT, and IGBFP7 provides unique clinical, diagnostic, and prognostic information in patients presenting with acute dyspnea. Differences in the number of elevated biomarkers at presentation may allow for more efficient clinical risk stratification of short-term mortality and HF rehospitalization.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

This study aimed to evaluate whether T790M, a resistant mutation, is more likely to coexist with L858R mutation than with exon 19 deletions in pretreatment NSCLC patients.We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE up to Nov 30th, 2015 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported pretreatment T790M and EGFR-activating mutation. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The primary outcome was odds ratio (OR) of pretreatment T790M mutation in NSCLC co-existing with L858R mutation and exon 19 deletions. Stratified analysis was performed based on sensitivity of mutation detection methods for T790M.We identified 15 observational studies and 3 RCTs for analysis. Pretreatment T790M was more frequent in L858R than in exon 19 mutated patients. The association of T790M and L858R was statistically significant in observational studies (OR, 1.65, 95% CI, 1.17-2.32), with less precision in RCTs (OR, 1.84, 95% CI, 0.96-3.52).

This study aimed at exploring the potential associations between a 6-month physical activity intervention and muscle characteristics, sarcopenia, oxidative stress and toxicities in patients with metastatic breast cancer.Women newly diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer (N = 49) participated in an unsupervised, personalized, 6-month physical activity intervention with activity tracker. Computerized tomography images at the third lumbar vertebra were analysed at baseline, three months and six months to assess sarcopenia (muscle mass index < 40 cm2/m2) and muscle quality (poor if muscle attenuation < 37.8 Hounsfield Units). Oxidative markers included plasma antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities), prooxidant enzymes (NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase activities) and oxidative stress damage markers (advanced oxidation protein products, malondialdehyde (MDA) and DNA oxidation.At baseline 53% (mean age 55 years (SD 10.41)) were sarcopenic and 75% had poor muscle quality. Muscle cross sectional area, skeletal muscle radiodensity, lean body mass remained constant over the six months (p = 0.75, p = 0.07 and p = 0.75 respectively), but differed significantly between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients at baseline and 6-months. Sarcopenic patients at baseline were more likely to have an increase of MDA (p = 0.02) at 6 months. Being sarcopenic during at least one moment during the 6-month study was associated with a higher risk of developing severe toxicities (grade > 2) (p = 0.02).This study suggests potential benefits of physical activity for maintenance of muscle mass.

More than 80% of people affected by CD will not have access to diagnosis and continued treatment, which partly supports the high morbidity and mortality rate. Machine Learning (ML) can identify patterns in data that can be used to increase our understanding of a specific problem or make predictions about the future. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate different models of ML to predict death in two years of patients with CD. ML models were developed using different techniques and configurations. The techniques used were: Random Forests, Adaptive Boosting, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Networks. The adopted settings considered only interview variables, only complementary exam variables, and finally, both mixed. Data from a cohort study with CD patients called SaMi-Trop were analyzed. The predictor variables came from the baseline; and the outcome, which was death, came from the first follow-up. All models were evaluated in terms of Sensitivity, Specificity and G-mean. Among the 1694 individuals with CD considered, 134 (7.9%) died within two years of follow-up. Using only the predictor variables from the interview, the different techniques achieved a maximum G-mean of 0.64 in predicting death. Using only the variables from complementary exams, the G-mean was up to 0.77. In this configuration, the protagonism of NT-proBNP was evident, where it was possible to observe that an ML model using only this single variable reached G-mean of 0.76. The configuration that mixed interview variables and complementary exams achieved G-mean of 0.75. ML can be used as a useful tool with the potential to contribute to the management of patients with CD, by identifying patients with the highest probability of death.

Nine serum fibrosis algorithms were investigated (GUCI, King's Score, APRI, FIB-4, Lok-Index, NIKEI, NASH-CRN regression score, Forns' score, and NAFLD-fibrosis score).The diagnostic performance (AUROC) for identification of significant fibrosis (F2-4) was 0.78, 0.80, 0.69, and 0.78 for MRE, TE, LSC_N10, and GUCI, respectively. For the identification of advanced fibrosis (F3-4), the AUROCs were 0.93, 0.84, 0.81, and 0.82 respectively.MRE and TE were superior for non-invasive identification of significant fibrosis. Serum fibrosis algorithms developed for specific liver diseases are applicable in this cohort of diverse liver diseases aetiologies. Gadoxetate-MRI was sufficiently sensitive to detect the low function losses associated with fibrosis. None was able to efficiently distinguish between stages within the low fibrosis stages.Lay summaryExcessive accumulation of scar tissue, fibrosis, in the liver is an important aspect in chronic liver disease. To replace the invasive needle biopsy, we have explored non-invasive methods to assess liver fibrosis. In our study we found that elastographic methods, which assess the mechanical properties of the liver, are superior in assessing fibrosis in a clinical setting. Of interest from a clinical trial point-of-view, none of the tested methods was sufficiently accurate to distinguish between adjacent moderate fibrosis stages.",NA,21/07/2020,D003160;D016428,10.1080/00365521.2020.1786599,NA,1,1,,

Increased understanding of both aspects can enable better patient management and improve clinical trial design. Previous approaches to modelling Parkinson's disease progression assumed static progression trajectories within subgroups and have not adequately accounted for complex medication effects. Our objective was to develop a statistical progression model of Parkinson's disease that accounts for intra-individual and inter-individual variability and medication effects.In this longitudinal data study, data were collected for up to 7-years on 423 patients with early Parkinson's disease and 196 healthy controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) longitudinal observational study. A contrastive latent variable model was applied followed by a novel personalised input-output hidden Markov model to define disease states. Clinical significance of the states was assessed using statistical tests on seven key motor or cognitive outcomes (mild cognitive impairment, dementia, dyskinesia, presence of motor fluctuations, functional impairment from motor fluctuations, Hoehn and Yahr score, and death) not used in the learning phase. The results were validated in an independent sample of 610 patients with Parkinson's disease from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP).PPMI data were download July 25, 2018, medication information was downloaded on Sept 24, 2018, and PDBP data were downloaded between June 15 and June 24, 2020. The model discovered eight disease states, which are primarily differentiated by functional impairment, tremor, bradykinesia, and neuropsychiatric measures. State 8, the terminal state, had the highest prevalence of key clinical outcomes including 18 (95%) of 19 recorded instances of dementia. At study outset 4 (1%) of 333 patients were in state 8 and 138 (41%) of 333 patients reached stage 8 by year 5. However, the ranking of the starting state did not match the ranking of reaching state 8 within 5 years. Overall, patients starting in state 5 had the shortest time to terminal state (median 2·75 [95% CI 1·75-4·25] years).We developed a statistical progression model of early Parkinson's disease that accounts for intra-individual and inter-individual variability and medication effects. Our predictive model discovered non-sequential, overlapping disease progression trajectories, supporting the use of non-deterministic disease progression models, and suggesting static subtype assignment might be ineffective at capturing the full spectrum of Parkinson's disease progression.Michael J Fox Foundation.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Patients 60 days to 18 years of age in whom clinicians suspected sepsis were included; patients with septic shock on arrival were excluded. The outcome, septic shock, was systolic hypotension with vasoactive medication or ≥30 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid within 24 hours of arrival. Elastic net regularization, a penalized regression technique, was used to develop a model in the training set.Of 2464 included visits, septic shock occurred in 282 (11.4%). The model had an area under the curve of 0.79 (0.76-0.83) in the training set, 0.75 (0.69-0.81) in the temporal test set, and 0.87 (0.73-1.00) in the geographic test set. With a threshold set to 90% sensitivity in the training set, the model yielded 82% (72%-90%) sensitivity and 48% (44%-52%) specificity in the temporal test set, and 90% (55%-100%) sensitivity and 32% (21%-46%) specificity in the geographic test set.This model estimated the risk of septic shock in children at hospital arrival earlier than existing models. It leveraged the predictive value of routine electronic health record data through a modern predictive algorithm and has the potential to enhance clinical risk stratification in the critical moments before deterioration.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The patients with cervical spondylosis are often confronted with difficult laryngoscopy who are more prone to appear difficult airway, so it is important to figure out valuable predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in these patients.We randomly enrolled 270 patients undergoing elective cervical spine surgery and analyzed the cervical mobility data in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. The preoperative X-ray radiological indicators were measured by an attending radiologist. Cormack-Lehane scales were assessed during intubation, and patients with a class III or IV view were assigned to the difficult laryngoscopy group.Univariate analysis showed that the hyomental distance (HMD, the distance between the hyoid bone and the tip of the chin) and the hyomental distance ratio (HMDR, the ratio between HMD in the extension position and the one in the neutral position) might not be suitable indicators in patients with cervical spondylosis. Binary multivariate logistic regression (backward-Wald) analyses identified two independent correlative factors from the cervical mobility indicators that correlated best as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy: modified Mallampati test (MMT) and C2C6AR (the ratio of the angle between a line passing through the bottom of the second cervical vertebra and a line passing through the bottom of the sixth cervical vertebra in the extension position and the one in the neutral position). The odds ratio (OR) and 95 % CI were 2.292(1.093-4.803) and 0.493 (0.306-0.793), respectively. C2C6AR exhibited the largest area under the curve (0.714; 95 % CI 0.633-0.794).C2C6AR based on preoperative X-ray images may be the most accurate predictor of cervical mobility indicators for difficult laryngoscopy in patients with cervical spondylosis.The study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( http://www.chictr.org.cn ; identifier: ChiCTR-ROC-16,008,598) on June 6, 2016.",No. Z181100001718109|the Capital Clinical Characteristic Applied Research Project of China||NO. 21900007|Young Scholar Research Grant of Chinese Anesthesiologist Association||No. Y86471-01|Hospital Medical Research Foundation of Peking University Third Hospital|,14/04/2021,D016430;D016428;D013485,10.1186/s12871-021-01335-4,NA,1,1,,

Enumeration and characterization of patients' baseline CTCs (CTCs+ and CTCs-, indicating detectable and undetectable CTCs, respectively) were performed using the CanPatrol technique, which detects markers of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CTCs, and classifies CTCs into epithelial, biophenotypic and mesenchymal phenotypes.After a median follow-up of 24 months, 90 patients (83.3%) progressed to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), 93 patients (86.1%) had detectable CTCs, and the median number of CTCs was 4. The rate of progression to CRPC was significantly higher for patients with mesenchymal CTCs+ than for patients with CTCs+/mesenchymal CTCs- and CTCs- (93.1% vs 71.4% and 73.3%; P = 0.013). The median time to CRPC for patients with mesenchymal CTCs+ was significantly shorter than for those with CTCs+/mesenchymal CTCs- and CTCs- (10.5 months vs 18.0 and 14.0 months; P = 0.003). Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the CTC phenotype was the only independent prognostic factor influencing the progression of disease from CSPC to CRPC.Characterization of baseline CTCs according to the EMT phenotype predicted the effective period of standard ADT for patients newly diagnosed with metastatic CSPC. These findings are important for counselling patients and designing clinical trials.© 2018 The Authors BJU International © 2018 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",NA,12/12/2018,D016428;D013485,10.1111/bju.14642,NA,1,1,,

Symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) are also a frequent consequence of trauma exposure. Identifying novel risk markers in the immediate aftermath of trauma is a critical step for the identification of novel biological targets to understand mechanisms of pathophysiology and prevention, as well as the determination of patients most at risk who may benefit from immediate intervention. Our study utilizes a novel approach to computationally integrate blood-based transcriptomics, genomics, and interactomics to understand the development of risk vs. resilience in the months following trauma exposure. In a two-site longitudinal, observational prospective study, we assessed over 10,000 individuals and enrolled >700 subjects in the immediate aftermath of trauma (average 5.3 h post-trauma (range 0.5-12 h)) in the Grady Memorial Hospital (Atlanta) and Jackson Memorial Hospital (Miami) emergency departments. RNA expression data and 6-month follow-up data were available for 366 individuals, while genotype, transcriptome, and phenotype data were available for 297 patients. To maximize our power and understanding of genes and pathways that predict risk vs. resilience, we utilized a set-cover approach to capture fluctuations of gene expression of PTSD or depression-converting patients and non-converting trauma-exposed controls to find representative sets of disease-relevant dysregulated genes. We annotated such genes with their corresponding expression quantitative trait loci and applied a variant of a current flow algorithm to identify genes that potentially were causal for the observed dysregulation of disease genes involved in the development of depression and PTSD symptoms after trauma exposure. We obtained a final list of 11 driver causal genes related to MDD symptoms, 13 genes for PTSD symptoms, and 22 genes in PTSD and/or MDD. We observed that these individual or combined disorders shared ESR1, RUNX1, PPARA, and WWOX as driver causal genes, while other genes appeared to be causal driver in the PTSD only or MDD only cases. A number of these identified causal pathways have been previously implicated in the biology or genetics of PTSD and MDD, as well as in preclinical models of amygdala function and fear regulation. Our work provides a promising set of initial pathways that may underlie causal mechanisms in the development of PTSD or MDD in the aftermath of trauma.© 2021.

We also collected 211 samples of laryngeal carcinoma and 233 samples of nasopharyngeal carcinoma from the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University. The tasks of three tumor datasets were risk assessment (gastrointestinal stromal tumor), T3/T4 staging prediction (laryngeal carcinoma), and distant metastasis prediction (nasopharyngeal carcinoma), respectively. First, deep learning and radiomics were respectively used to construct peritumoral models, to study whether the peritumor had predictive value on three tumor datasets. Furthermore, we defined different sizes peritumors including fixed size (not considering tumor size) and adaptive size (according to average tumor radius) to explore the influence of peritumor of different sizes and types of tumors. Finally, we visualized the deep learning and radiomic models to observe the influence of the peritumor in three datasets.The performance of intra-peritumors are better than intratumors alone in three datasets. Specifically, the comparisons of area under receiver operating characteristic curve in the testing set between intra-peritumoral and intratumoral models are: 0.908 vs 0.873 (P value: 0.037) in gastrointestinal stromal tumor datasets, 0.796 vs 0.756 (P value: 0.188) in laryngeal carcinoma datasets and 0.660 vs 0.579 (P value: 0.431) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma datasets. Furthermore, for gastrointestinal stromal tumor datasets, deep learning is more stable to learn peritumors with both fixed and adaptive size than radiomics. For laryngeal carcinoma datasets, the intra-peritumoral radiomic model could make model performance more balanced. For nasopharyngeal carcinoma datasets, radiomics is also more suitable for modeling peritumors than deep learning. The size of the peritumor is critical in this task, and only the performance of 1.5 mm-4.5 mm peritumors is stable.Our results indicate that peritumors have additional predictive value in three tumor datasets through deep learning or radiomics. The definitions of the peritumoral region and artificial intelligence method also have great influence on the performance of the peritumor.© 2021 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",2017YFC1309100|National Key R&D Program of China||2017YFC1308700|National Key R&D Program of China||2017YFA0205200|National Key R&D Program of China||2017YFA0700401|National Key R&D Program of China||82022036|National Natural Science Foundation of China||91959130|National Natural Science Foundation of China||81971776|National Natural Science Foundation of China||81771924|National Natural Science Foundation of China||6202790004|National Natural Science Foundation of China||81930053 : 81527805|National Natural Science Foundation of China||L182061|The Beijing Natural Science Foundation||XDB 38040200|Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences||YZ201502|Instrument Developing Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences||GJJSTD20170004|Chinese Academy of Sciences||QYZDJ-SSW-JSC005|Chinese Academy of Sciences||2017175|Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS|,14/02/2021,D016428;D016448,10.1002/mp.14767,NA,1,1,,

We also used propensity score matching to control for observed confounding factors that might influence outcomes.The primary outcome was the number of VFDs. Secondary outcomes included distant organ failures including acute kidney injury (AKI) and use of renal replacement therapy (RRT), and mortality.In the unmatched cohort, the higher PEEP strategy had no association with the median [IQR] number of VFDs (2.0 [0.0 to 15.0] vs. 0.0 [0.0 to 16.0] days). The median (95% confidence interval) difference was 0.21 (-3.34 to 3.78) days, P = 0.905.

The study objective was to develop and validate a clinical score to predict emergency department and in-hospital mortality among consecutive nonpalliative patients with COVID-19; in this study, we define palliative patients as those who do not want resuscitative measures, such as intubation, intensive care unit care or cardiopulmonary resuscitation.This derivation and validation study used observational cohort data recruited from 46 hospitals in 8 Canadian provinces participating in the Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN). We included adult (age ≥ 18 yr) nonpalliative patients with confirmed COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department of a participating site between Mar. 1, 2020, and Jan. 31, 2021. We randomly assigned hospitals to derivation or validation, and prespecified clinical variables as candidate predictors. We used logistic regression to develop the score in a derivation cohort and examined its performance in predicting emergency department and in-hospital mortality in a validation cohort.Of 8761 eligible patients, 618 (7.0%) died. The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score included age, sex, type of residence, arrival mode, chest pain, severe liver disease, respiratory rate and level of respiratory support. The area under the curve was 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-0.93) in derivation and 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.93) in validation. The score had excellent calibration. These results suggest that scores of 6 or less would categorize patients as being at low risk for in-hospital death, with a negative predictive value of 99.9%. Patients in the low-risk group had an in-hospital mortality rate of 0.1%. Patients with a score of 15 or higher had an observed mortality rate of 81.0%.The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score is a simple score that can be used for level-of-care discussions with patients and in situations of critical care resource constraints to accurately predict death using variables available on emergency department arrival.

Data collected included the number of PIVC insertion attempts and potential predictors of the risk of failure (including pre-operative patient characteristics and data relative to the procedure). Uni- and multivariable logistic analyses were performed. Based on these results, the VENSCORE scale was developed to predict the risk of failure of the first PIVC insertion.In total, 3394 patients were included, and 27 were excluded because of protocol violations. The PIVC insertion failure rate at the first attempt was 20.3%. Based on multivariable analysis, a history of difficult PIVC insertions, high-risk surgery, poor vein visibility, and moderate to poor vein palpability were identified as risk factors for insertion failure at the first attempt.

A more pro-inflammatory diet at diagnosis as well as six months after diagnosis was associated with higher levels of TNFα, hsCRP and the summary inflammatory z-score. Results of RCS showed no relationship between the ADII and CRC outcomes at both time points. Also results of the Cox proportional hazard models showed no associations between the ADII at both time points and recurrence (HR (95%CI) 0.98 (0.94-1.04) & 0.96 (0.91-1.02) or all-cause mortality (HR (95%CI) 1.03 (0.98-1.07) & 1.00 (0.95-1.05)).Our study did not show an association between the ADII and recurrence and all-cause mortality in CRC patients. Further research should also take into account molecular tumor subtypes, as the effect of the inflammatory potential of the diet on cancer recurrence and mortality is more likely to be present in tumors with an inflammatory signature.The colon study: NCT03191110; clinical trials.gov.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

We sought to determine if neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation was associated with adherence to immunosuppressive medications after liver transplantation.We conducted a secondary analysis of a multicenter, prospective cohort of children enrolled in the medication adherence in children who had a liver transplant study (enrollment 2010-2013). Participants (N = 271) received a liver transplant ≥1 year before enrollment and were subsequently treated with tacrolimus. The primary exposure, connected to geocoded participant home addresses, was a neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation index (range 0-1, higher indicates more deprivation). The primary outcome was the medication level variability index (MLVI), a surrogate measure of adherence to immunosuppression in pediatric liver transplant recipients. Higher MLVI indicates worse adherence behavior; values ≥2.5 are predictive of late allograft rejection.There was a 5% increase in MLVI for each 0.1 increase in deprivation index (95% confidence interval, -1% to 11%; P = 0.08). Roughly 24% of participants from the most deprived quartile had an MLVI ≥2.5 compared with 12% in the remaining 3 quartiles (P = 0.018). Black children were more likely to have high MLVI even after adjusting for deprivation (adjusted odds ratio 4.0 95% confidence interval, 1.7-10.6).This is the first study to evaluate associations between neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and an objective surrogate measure of medication adherence in children posttransplant. These findings suggest that neighborhood context may be an important consideration when assessing adherence. Differential rates of medication adherence may partly explain links between neighborhood factors and adverse health outcomes following pediatric liver transplantation.",K23 AI112916|NIAID NIH HHS|United States|R01 DK080740|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|T32 DK007727|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States,8/02/2020,D003160;D016428;D016448;D064888;D052061;D013485,10.1097/TP.0000000000003157,NA,1,1,,

This is a secondary analysis from a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort comparing 75 adults requiring intensive care with 38 hospitalized in medical wards. Different immune response biomarkers within 24 h of hospitalization and their association with hospital mortality were assessed.Fifty-three were discharged alive. Non-survivors were associated (p<0.05) with lower lymphocytes (751 vs. 387), monocytes (450 vs. 220) expression of HLA-DR (1,662 vs. 962) and higher IgM levels (178 vs. 152;p<0.01). Lymphocyte subpopulations amongst non-survivors showed a significantly (p<0.05) lower number of TCD3+ (247.2 vs. 520.8), TCD4+ (150.3 vs. 323.6), TCD8+ (95.3 vs. 151.4) and NKCD56+ (21.9 vs. 91.4). Number of lymphocytes, monocytes and NKCD56+ predicted hospital mortality (AUC 0.854). Hospital mortality was independently associated with low HLA-DR values, low number of NKCD56+ cells, and high IgM levels, in a Cox-proportional hazard analysis. A second model, documented that hospital mortality was independently associated with a phenotype combining immunoparalysis with hyperinflammation (HR 5.53; 95%CI 2.16-14.14), after adjusting by predicted mortality.We conclude that amongst influenza pneumonia, presence of immunoparalysis was a major mortality driver. Influenza heterogeneity was partly explained by early specific host response dysregulations which should be considered to design personalized approaches of adjunctive therapy.Copyright © 2022 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

Apathy and ICDs were assessed using the Movement Disorders Society-revised Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (QUIP), respectively. We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and log-linear mixed-effects (LME) regression to model SBRs with neurobehavioral metrics.Among 23 participants (mean age 62.7 years, mean disease duration 1.8 years) with VMAT2 imaging data, 5 had apathy, 5 had an ICD, and 13 had neither.

Post-hoc tests and repeated-measures analysis with LME regression also supported right striatal VMAT2 elevation in the ICD group and reduction in the apathy group relative to the group with neither ICD nor apathy. DaT did not exhibit similar correlations, but normalizing VMAT2 with DaT SBR strengthened bidirectional correlations with ICD (high VMAT2/DaT) and apathy (low VMAT2/DaT) in all striatal regions bilaterally.Our findings constitute preliminary evidence that striatal presynaptic dopaminergic function helps describe the neurobiological basis of motivational dysregulation in PD, from high in ICDs to low in apathy.",K23 NS101096|NINDS NIH HHS|United States|K23 AG044441|NIA NIH HHS|United States|F30 AG067643|NIA NIH HHS|United States|T32 GM007309|NIGMS NIH HHS|United States|T32 GM136577|NIGMS NIH HHS|United States,25/02/2021,D016428;D016448;D064888;D052061,10.1177/0891988721996802,NA,1,1,,

A chart for the estimate of cardiovascular risk (major coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease events) in 10 years was produced for men and women aged 45-74 free from cardiovascular diseases. Risk factors employed in the estimate were sex, age (6 classes), systolic blood pressure (4 classes), serum cholesterol (5 classes), diabetes, and cigarette smoking (4 classes). Estimates were produced for absolute risk and for relative risk, the latter against levels expected in the general population that produced the risk functions. Software was produced for the separate estimate of major coronary, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events (the latter made by coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease of atherosclerotic origin) for follow-up at 5, 10 or 15 years, in men a women aged 35-74 years at entry and free from cardiovascular diseases. Risk factors employed here were sex, age, body mass index, mean physiological blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diabetes and heart rate. The output is based on several indicators: absolute risk, relative risk (as defined above), ideal risk (for a very favourable risk profile), biological age of risk, comparisons among the above indicators, the percent contribution of risk factors to the excess of estimated risk above the level of the ideal risk, and the description of trends in risk estimate in relation to repeated measurements.These tools represent progress compared to similar tools produced some years ago by the same Research Group.",NA,30/11/2005,D016428;D016448;D013485,10.1016/j.numecd.2005.07.007,NA,0,0,,

We sought to identify an HbA1c threshold predictive of increased risk for perioperative and postoperative complications after pelvic reconstructive surgery.This multicenter retrospective cohort study involving 10 geographically diverse U.S. female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery programs identified women with diabetes who underwent prolapse and/or stress urinary incontinence surgery from September 1, 2013, to August 31, 2018. We collected information on demographics, preoperative HbA1c levels, surgery type, complications, and outcomes. Sensitivity analyses identified thresholds of complications stratified by HbA1c. Multivariate logistic regression further evaluated the association between HbA1c and complications after adjustments.Eight hundred seven charts were identified. In this diabetic cohort, the rate of overall complications was 44.1%, and severe complications were 14.9%. Patients with an am HbA1c value of 8% or greater (reference HbA1c, <8%) had an increased rate of both severe (27.1% vs 12.8%, P < 0.001) and overall complications (57.6% vs 41.8%, P = 0.002) that persisted after multivariate logistic regression (odds ratio, 2.618; 95% confidence interval, 1.560-4.393 and odds ratio, 1.931; 95% confidence interval, 1.264-2.949, respectively).

We used real-world data estimating the likelihood of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), and acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Costs included catheter costs (estimated $200), costs of additional intensive care unit (ICU) days from IAH and ACS, and costs of CRRT. We took the preventability of IAH/ACS given early detection from a trial of non-surgical interventions in IAH. We evaluated uncertainty through probabilistic sensitivity analysis and the effect of individual model parameters on the primary outcome of cost savings through one-way sensitivity analysis.In the base case, urinary catheter monitoring of IAP in the perioperative period of major abdominal surgery had 81% fewer cases of IAH of any grade, 64% fewer cases of AKI, and 96% fewer cases of ACS.

In this observational study, we recruited patients with MCL with CNS involvement at relapse who received CNS-directed therapy between 2000 and 2019. The primary objective was to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients treated with ibrutinib or BBB crossing chemotherapy. A propensity score based on a multivariable binary regression model was applied to balance treatment cohorts. Eighty-eight patients were included.

The risk of neoplasia was not significantly associated with the type of lesion (P = .94 from log-rank test), primary sclerosing cholangitis (P = .94), or active inflammation (P = .41) in this cohort. However, the finding of DNA aneuploidy at baseline IND was predictive of subsequent detection of neoplasia (P = .037). IND patients with abnormal DNA flow cytometric results may warrant more careful follow-up, but conversely, IND in the setting of normal DNA content may require less frequent surveillance colonoscopy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Consecutive women with abnormal vaginal bleeding presenting for ultrasound examination (n = 2,417) were recruited. The histology was obtained from endometrial sampling, D&amp;C, hysteroscopic resection, hysterectomy, or ultrasound follow-up for >1 year.A model was developed using multinomial regression based on age, body mass index, and ultrasound predictors to distinguish between: (1) endometrial atrophy, (2) endometrial polyp or intracavitary myoma, (3) endometrial malignancy or atypical hyperplasia, (4) proliferative/secretory changes, endometritis, or hyperplasia without atypia and validated using leave-center-out cross-validation and bootstrapping. The main outcomes are the model's ability to discriminate between the four outcomes and the calibration of risk estimates.The median age in 2,417 women was 50 (interquartile range 43-57). 414 (17%) women had endometrial atrophy; 996 (41%) had a polyp or myoma; 155 (6%) had an endometrial malignancy or atypical hyperplasia; and 852 (35%) had proliferative/secretory changes, endometritis, or hyperplasia without atypia. The model distinguished well between malignant and benign histology (c-statistic 0.88 95% CI: 0.85-0.91) and between all benign histologies. The probabilities for each of the four outcomes were over- or underestimated depending on the centers.Not all patients had a diagnosis based on histology. The model over- or underestimated the risk for certain outcomes in some centers, indicating local recalibration is advisable.The proposed model reliably distinguishes between four histological outcomes. This is the first model to discriminate between several outcomes and is the only model applicable when menopausal status is uncertain. The model could be useful for patient management and counseling, and aid in the interpretation of ultrasound findings. Future research is needed to externally validate and locally recalibrate the model.© 2022 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.",NA,14/02/2022,D016428;D016448,10.1159/000522524,NA,1,1,,

However, acute DoC is rarely investigated, although identifying residual consciousness is key to clinical decision-making in the intensive care unit (ICU). Therefore, the objective of the prospective, observational, tertiary centre cohort, diagnostic phase IIb study 'Consciousness in neurocritical care cohort study using EEG and fMRI' (CONNECT-ME, NCT02644265) was to assess the accuracy of fMRI and EEG to identify residual consciousness in acute DoC in the ICU. Between April 2016 and November 2020, 87 acute DoC patients with traumatic or non-traumatic brain injury were examined with repeated clinical assessments, fMRI and EEG. Resting-state EEG and EEG with external stimulations were evaluated by visual analysis, spectral band analysis and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) consciousness classifier. In addition, within- and between-network resting-state connectivity for canonical resting-state fMRI networks was assessed. Next, we used EEG and fMRI data at study enrolment in two different machine-learning algorithms (Random Forest and SVM with a linear kernel) to distinguish patients in a minimally conscious state or better (≥MCS) from those in coma or unresponsive wakefulness state (≤UWS) at time of study enrolment and at ICU discharge (or before death). Prediction performances were assessed with area under the curve (AUC). Of 87 DoC patients (mean age, 50.0 ± 18 years, 43% female), 51 (59%) were ≤UWS and 36 (41%) were ≥ MCS at study enrolment. Thirty-one (36%) patients died in the ICU, including 28 who had life-sustaining therapy withdrawn. EEG and fMRI predicted consciousness levels at study enrolment and ICU discharge, with maximum AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI 0.77-0.80) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.77-0.80), respectively. Models based on combined EEG and fMRI features predicted consciousness levels at study enrolment and ICU discharge with maximum AUCs of 0.78 (95% CI 0.71-0.86) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.89), respectively, with improved positive predictive value and sensitivity. Overall, both machine-learning algorithms (SVM and Random Forest) performed equally well. In conclusion, we suggest that acute DoC prediction models in the ICU be based on a combination of fMRI and EEG features, regardless of the machine-learning algorithm used.© The Author(s) 2022.

Not much is known about pain in unstable disease. The primary aim of the present study is to investigate prevalence, characteristics and relationships of pain in patients with COPD hospitalized for an acute exacerbation (AECOPD) and indicated for post-acute pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). This cross-sectional observational study included 149 patients (mean age 70.8 (±7.9) years, 49% male, mean forced expiratory volume in one second as percentage of predicted value 35.3 (±12.6)). Pain was assessed using the brief pain inventory. Functional status and health status were measured using the six-minute walking test (6MWT), the Barthel index (BI) and the clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ), respectively. Pain was prevalent in 39.6% of all patients. Symptom burden was high, especially in patients with pain. Although we found no difference in objective measurements of functional status (6MWT, BI), patients with pain had clinically relevant lower health status (CCQ), attributed to the functional domain. Pain in patients hospitalized for AECOPD and indicated for post-acute PR is a relevant problem and needs more attention.

FFRCT was measured at a blinded core laboratory, and FFRCT results were unavailable to caregivers. We determined the agreement of FFRCT (positive if ≤0.80) with stenosis on CTA and ICA (positive if ≥50% left main or ≥70% other coronary artery), and predictive value for a composite of coronary revascularization or major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina). We retrospectively assessed whether adding FFRCT ≤0.80 as a gatekeeper could improve efficiency of referral to ICA, defined as decreased rate of ICA without ≥50% stenosis and increased ICA leading to revascularization.FFRCT was calculated in 67% (181 of 271) of eligible patients (mean age 62 years; 36% women). FFRCT was discordant with stenosis in 31% (57 of 181) for CTA and 29% (52 of 181) for ICA. Most patients undergoing coronary revascularization had an FFRCT of ≤0.80 (91%; 80 of 88). An FFRCT of ≤0.80 was a significantly better predictor for revascularization or major adverse cardiac events than severe CTA stenosis (HR: 4.3 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4 to 8.9] vs. 2.9 [95% CI: 1.8 to 5.1]; p = 0.033). Reserving ICA for patients with an FFRCT of ≤0.80 could decrease ICA without ≥50% stenosis by 44%, and increase the proportion of ICA leading to revascularization by 24%.In this hypothesis-generating study of patients with stable chest pain referred to ICA from CTA, an FFRCT of ≤0.80 was a better predictor of revascularization or major adverse cardiac events than severe stenosis on CTA. Adding FFRCT may improve efficiency of referral to ICA from CTA alone.Copyright © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Cancer risk specifically in children born after donor ART has not been investigated to date.This retrospective cohort study utilized record linkage to determine the outcome status of all children born in Great Britain (1992-2008) after donor ART. The cohort included 12 137 members who contributed 95 389 person-years of follow-up (average follow-up 7.86 years).Records of all children born in Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland) after all forms of donor ART (1992-2008) were linked to the UK National Registry of Childhood Tumours (NRCT) to determine the number who subsequently developed cancer by 15 years of age, by the end of 2008. Rates of overall and type specific cancer (selected a priori) were compared with age, sex and calendar year standardized population-based rates, stratifying for potential mediating/moderating factors including sex, age at diagnosis, birth weight, multiple births, maternal previous live births, assisted conception type and fresh/ cryopreserved cycles.In our cohort of 12 137 children born after donor ART (52% male, 55% singleton births), no overall increased risk of cancer was identified. There were 12 cancers detected compared to 14.4 expected (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 0.83; 95% CI 0.43-1.45; P = 0.50). A small, significant increased risk of hepatoblastoma was found, but the numbers and absolute risks were small (<5 cases observed; SIR 10.28; 95% CI 1.25-37.14; P < 0.05). This increased hepatoblastoma risk was associated with low birthweight.Although this study includes a large number of children born after donor ART, the rarity of specific diagnostic subgroups of childhood cancer results in few cases and therefore wide CIs for such outcomes. As this is an observational study, it is not possible to adjust for all potential confounders; we have instead used stratification to explore potential moderating and mediating factors, where data were available.This is the first study to investigate cancer risk in children born after donor ART. Although based on small numbers, results are reassuring for families and clinicians. The small but significant increased risk of hepatoblastoma detected was associated with low birthweight, a known risk factor for this tumour type. It should be emphasized that the absolute risks are very small. However, on-going investigation with a longer follow-up is needed.This work was funded by Cancer Research UK (C36038/A12535) and the National Institute for Health Research (405526) and supported by the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust and University College London.

However, some patients obtain little benefit and experience unnecessary toxicities from IC. We intended to develop a gene-expression signature that can identify beneficiaries of IC.We screened chemosensitivity-related genes by comparing gene-expression profiles of patients with short-term tumor response or nonresponse to IC (n = 95) using microarray analysis. Chemosensitivity-related genes were quantified by digital expression profiling in a training cohort (n = 342) to obtain a gene signature. We then validated this gene signature in the clinical trial cohort (n = 187) and an external independent cohort (n = 240). Tests of statistical significance are 2-sided.We identified 43 chemosensitivity-related genes associated with the short-term tumor response to IC. In the training cohort, a 6-gene signature was developed that was highly accurate at predicting the short-term tumor response to IC (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87, sensitivity = 87.5%, specificity = 75.6%). We further found that IC conferred failure-free survival benefits only in patients in the benefit group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.34 to 0.87; P = .01) and not on those in the no-benefit group (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.62 to 2.51; P = .53). In the clinical trial cohort, the 6-gene signature was also highly accurate at predicting the tumor response (AUC = 0.82, sensitivity = 87.5%, specificity = 71.8%) and indicated failure-free survival benefits. In the external independent cohort, similar results were observed.The 6-gene signature can help select beneficiaries of IC and lay a foundation for a more individualized therapeutic strategy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.© The Author(s) 2020.

Recommendations were graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system.The panel developed 11 consensus statements for biomarker use and 14 research recommendations. The key suggestions were that a combination of damage and functional biomarkers, along with clinical information, be used to identify high-risk patient groups, improve the diagnostic accuracy of AKI, improve processes of care, and assist the management of AKI.Current evidence from clinical studies supports the use of new biomarkers in prevention and management of AKI.

The main outcomes were birthweight and large for gestational age.Out of 361 women, 164 (45.4%) were diagnosed with gestational diabetes, 133 (81.1%) of them in early pregnancy. The mean offspring birthweight was 3673 g (standard deviation (SD) 589 g) in the early and 3710 g (SD 552 g) in the late gestational diabetes group. In a multivariate logit model, the odds ratio for large for gestational age was 2.01 (95% CI: 0.39-10.39) in early compared with late gestational diabetes.We observed no statistically significant differences in neonatal outcomes according to timing of gestational diabetes diagnosis. In addition to lack of power, early treatment of hyperglycemia may partly explain the results.© The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.

The long-term risks of stroke, mortality and AF recurrence rate in patients with postoperative AF (POAF) are unclear.We performed a systematic literature review in electronic databases from inception to March 5th, 2020 of studies reporting the incidence of stroke, mortality and AF recurrence in patients with POAF. We confined our analysis to studies with a cohort of at least 150 patients with POAF and with a median follow-up of 12 months as a minimum. Odds Ratios (OR) were pooled using a random-effects model.Qualitative analysis included 8 studies (7 observational cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial) enrolling 3,718,587 patients. Six studies underwent metanalysis comprising 17,684 postoperative patients with POAF and 2,169,248 postoperative patients without POAF. The development of POAF conferred a four-fold increased risk of stroke in the long-term [OR 4.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.91-5.62]. Mortality in the two studies reporting long-term data was higher in patients with POAF compared to those without POAF (OR 3.59; CI 95% 2.84-4.53). Data about recurrence were too heterogeneous to undergo metanalysis.POAF is associated with a greater risk of stroke and mortality over the long-term period. Studies focusing on AF recurrence are needed to address the perception of POAF as a benign transient entity. The increased mortality risk following POAF should encourage systematic detection and prevention of this arrhythmia.Copyright © 2020.

Rates of coronary angiography, coronary artery disease (CAD) and need for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), cardiac diseases associated with VTA, and differences in long-term prognostic endpoints for young adults (20-34 years old) were analyzed and compared to those of adults (35-45 years old), for whom multivariable risk prediction models were developed. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed according to age and type of VTA.A total of 259 consecutive patients were included in the study (36% young adults and 64% adults). At admission, 38% of young adults had VTA due to CAD that required PCI. Furthermore, VTA in young adults was commonly idiopathic (27%), or had underlying channelopathies (18%), primary cardiomyopathies (13%) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI, 11%). In adults, VTA was mostly associated with AMI (28%), though the rate of idiopathy was still high (20%). A total 41% of all patients received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), for whom AMI (STEMI 17%, NSTEMI 24%) was most frequently observed. Irrespective of the type of VTA, all-cause mortality was similar for young adults and adults. In young adults, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35% (HR = 33.590) was associated with increased long-term all-cause mortality.Despite high rates of idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmias, CAD and AMI are common causes of VTA and CPR in adults 45 years old and younger. Young adults and adults had comparable survival at index hospitalization and after 2.5 years irrespective of the type of VTA.

The purpose of this study is to construct a nomogram and online calculator to predict the development of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury (HA-AKI) in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which may contribute to the prognosis of ACLF.574 ACLF patients were evaluated retrospectively. AKI was defined by criteria proposed by International Club of Ascites (ICA) and divided into community-acquired and hospital-acquired AKI (CA-AKI and HA-AKI). The difference between CA-AKI and HA-AKI, factors associated with development into and recovered from AKI periods. The risk factors were identified and nomograms were developed to predict the morbidity of HA-AKI in patients with ACLF.Among 574 patients, 217(37.8%) patients had AKI, CA-AKI and HA-AKI were 56 (25.8%) and 161 (74.2%) respectively. The multivariate logistic regression model (KP-AKI) for predicting the occurrence of HA-AKI were age, gastrointestinal bleeding, bacterial infections, albumin, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen and prothrombin time. The AUROC of the KP-AKI in internal and external validations were 0.747 and 0.759, respectively. Among 217 AKI patients, 81(37.3%), 96(44.2%) and 40(18.4%) patients were with ICA-AKI stage progression, regression and fluctuated in-situ, respectively.

Inclusion criteria were angina with either multivessel or multilesion coronary artery disease with an abnormal baseline iFR. The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of residual ischemia after operator-assessed angiographically successful PCI, defined as an iFR <0.90. The causes of impaired iFR were categorized as stent related, untreated proximal or distal focal stenosis, or diffuse atherosclerosis.An average of 1.1 vessels per patient had abnormal baseline iFRs, with a mean value of 0.69 ± 0.22, which improved to 0.93 ± 0.07 post-PCI. Residual ischemia after angiographically successful PCI was present in 112 patients (24.0%), with a mean iFR in that population of 0.84 ± 0.06 (range 0.60 to 0.89). Among patients with impaired post-PCI iFRs, 81.6% had untreated focal stenoses that were angiographically inapparent, and 18.4% had diffuse disease. Among the focal lesions, 38.4% were located within the stent segment, while 31.5% were proximal and 30.1% were distal to the stent. Post-PCI vessel angiographic diameter stenosis was not a predictor of impaired post-procedural iFR.Blinded post-PCI physiological assessment detected residual ischemia in nearly 1 in 4 patients after coronary stenting despite an operator-determined angiographically successful result. Most cases of residual ischemia were due to inapparent focal lesions potentially amenable to treatment with additional PCI.

The aims of this study are to prospectively investigate cardiovascular outcomes and risk factors for incident cardiovascular disease in a post-stroke cohort, and to externally validate, refine and expand current risk prediction models for cardiovascular and cardiovascular-related outcomes. The study sample size was based on the development of post-stroke risk prediction models for AF and was calculated as 1222 participants. The study design is a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study. Participants will be adult patients admitted for ischaemic stroke confirmed by stroke physician or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) confirmed by MRI. Routinely collected data will be used in addition to the completion of simple validated questionnaires by the participants. Follow-up will be undertaken 12-months from the date of admission to hospital, in addition to linkage to routinely collected follow-up hospitalisation and mortality data. The primary outcomes are cardiovascular outcomes (including incident AF, stroke, TIA and myocardial infarction) at 12-month follow-up, all-cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular causes, and incident cognitive impairment and dementia. Secondary outcomes include changes in function, depression, anxiety, fatigue and quality of life. The study has received approval from the Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee (21/WA/0209), and is registered on https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ (Identifier NCT05132465).

This aspect is even more relevant in the category of HR NMIBC. Biomarkers might potentially help to further categorize the outcomes of these patients. Therefore, we sought to review the evidence available on tissue-based, urinary, and serum biomarkers for the prediction of recurrence, progression, and survival in HR NMIBC.A systematic literature review without time restrictions was performed using PubMed/EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Libraries. The search was filtered for articles in the English, Italian, German, French, and Spanish languages, involving patients with more than 18 years of age. Relevant papers on tissue-based, serum and urinary biomarkers related to the prediction of oncological outcomes for high-risk bladder cancer patients were included in the analyses.Overall, 71 studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. The majority of the investigations performed so far focused on immunohistochemical analyses on tumoral tissue. Overall, p53 was the most studied biomarker, but results regarding its prognostic and predictive role were contradictory. Ki67 seems to be a promising biomarker in the prediction of recurrence. Recently, PD-L1 has been associated with the prediction of recurrence free survival and of treatment-refractory disease. Markers developed un urine samples are focused on commercially available kits, which currently do not unequivocally show strongly superior levels of accuracy to cytology. However, they have demonstrated to be potentially helpful in the prediction of recurrence. Blood-based biomarkers represent an emerging reality with promising future applications.Despite a long history of attempts to discover accurate biomarkers predicting oncological outcomes for HR NMIBC, contradictory or uncertain findings render the adoption of this ancillary techniques in clinical practice still unlikely. Future attempts should be directed to the development of prospective trials and the definition of standardized cut-off levels to render findings worthy of comparison.",NA,17/04/2020,D016428;D016454,10.23736/S0393-2249.20.03786-8,NA,1,1,,

Here, we present the results of germline variant analysis and their clinical implications in a precision oncology study for patients with predominantly rare cancers.Matched tumor and control genome/exome and RNA sequencing was carried out for 1485 patients with rare cancers (79%) and/or young adults (77% younger than 51 years) in the National Center for Tumor Diseases/German Cancer Consortium (NCT/DKTK) Molecularly Aided Stratification for Tumor Eradication Research (MASTER) trial, a German multicenter, prospective, observational precision oncology study. Clinical and therapeutic relevance of prospective pathogenic germline variant (PGV) evaluation was analyzed and compared to other precision oncology studies.Ten percent of patients (n = 157) harbored PGVs in 35 genes associated with autosomal dominant cancer predisposition, whereof up to 75% were unknown before study participation. Another 5% of patients (n = 75) were heterozygous carriers for recessive genetic tumor risk syndromes. Particularly, high PGV yields were found in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) (28%, n = 11/40), and more specifically in wild-type GISTs (50%, n = 10/20), leiomyosarcomas (21%, n = 19/89), and hepatopancreaticobiliary cancers (16%, n = 16/97). Forty-five percent of PGVs (n = 100/221) supported treatment recommendations, and its implementation led to a clinical benefit in 40% of patients (n = 10/25). A comparison of different precision oncology studies revealed variable PGV yields and considerable differences in germline variant analysis workflows. We therefore propose a detailed workflow for germline variant evaluation.Genetic germline testing in patients with rare cancers can identify the very first patient in a hereditary cancer family and can lead to clinical benefit in a broad range of entities. Its routine implementation in precision oncology accompanied by the harmonization of germline variant evaluation workflows will increase clinical benefit and boost research.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Late asthmatic response (≥15% reduction in FEV1 within 24 h of NEC exit) was observed in 33% of subjects following either exposure. Average FEV1 and total nasal symptom score during NEC exposure were highly correlated within subjects between NEC exposures (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001; r = 0.73, p < 0.001), but total ocular symptom score was not. Time to EAR, but not average FEV1, was significantly associated with NEC Fel d 1 concentration, which was variable. There were no serious adverse events; 12/30 subjects experienced 20 adverse events (including asthma, 10%; headache, 10%).The NEC model demonstrates that average FEV1 change is highly reproducible and has a low correlation with cat allergen levels. However, time to EAR and incidence of EAR are less reproducible and are highly correlated with NEC allergen levels. Average FEV1, rather than incidence of EAR or time to EAR, could be considered as an endpoint for interventional trials testing cat-specific anti-allergy therapies using an NEC.© 2022 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Recent clinical trials have investigated the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in these patients. The use of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors has emerged as exciting therapeutic options in the curative and palliative setting of other solid tumors. We assessed the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors in esophageal and GEJ cancers. This systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive electronic literature search from the EMBASE, Pubmed, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases was conducted up to 25 July 2021. This review identified 11 eligible studies reporting outcomes of 3451 patients treated with PD-1 blockade compared with 2286 patients treated with either a placebo or the standard regimen of chemotherapy. Clinically significant improvements in median overall survival have been demonstrated in advanced and metastatic esophageal and GEJ cancer while maintaining acceptable safety profiles. Promising survival data have also recently emerged from PD-1 blockade in the adjuvant setting. PD-1 blockade in esophageal and GEJ cancer has delivered impressive survival benefit while remaining well tolerated. Its use in the adjuvant setting will further advance treatment options, and more advancements in this area of therapy are highly anticipated. However, further characterization of the PD-1/programmed death ligand-1 pathway and elucidation of biomarkers to predict response are required to optimize patient selection.© The Author(s) 2021.

However, there is a subset of patients that do not benefit from these therapies in terms of response rate or progression-free-survival (PFS). It has been shown that persistence of EGFR mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) at weeks 3 and 6 after start of osimertinib predicts shorter PFS. These patients may benefit from additional chemotherapy. While combination therapies with older TKI have been demonstrated effective in improving outcome, they are associated with a significant increase in toxicity.PACE-LUNG is a multicenter, single-arm, investigator initiated, phase II trial conducted with the German national Network Genomic Medicine (nNGM). Patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and exon 19 deletion or p.L858R EGFR mutation not amenable to curative treatment with persisting ctDNA after 3 to 4 weeks of first-line osimertinib monotherapy will receive additional chemotherapy (4 cycles of either cisplatin/pemetrexed or carboplatin/pemetrexed). Afterwards, osimertinib will be continued as standard of care until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint is PFS. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, response rate, safety, and quality of life. Concomitant translational research will be performed to identify patterns of mutational evolution in ctDNA upon disease progression or ctDNA persistence. Enrollment started in December 2021.The PACE-LUNG trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a biomarker-driven strategy for therapy escalation in patients at high risk for early treatment failure. This approach aims not only to improve treatment outcomes, but also to limit the anticipated additional toxicity to high-risk patients.2019-004757-88 (EudraCT).Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

There remains a need for effective and accurate screening methods for preterm birth. Using a proteomic approach, we previously discovered and validated (Proteomic Assessment of Preterm Risk study, NCT01371019) a preterm birth predictor comprising a ratio of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 to sex hormone-binding globulin.To determine the performance of the ratio of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 to sex hormone-binding globulin to predict both spontaneous and medically indicated very preterm births, in an independent cohort distinct from the one in which it was developed.This was a prospective observational study (Multicenter Assessment of a Spontaneous Preterm Birth Risk Predictor, NCT02787213) at 18 sites in the United States. Women had blood drawn at 170/7 to 216/7 weeks' gestation. For confirmation, we planned to analyze a randomly selected subgroup of women having blood drawn between 191/7 and 206/7 weeks' gestation, with the results of the remaining study participants blinded for future validation studies. Serum from participants was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Neonatal morbidity and mortality were analyzed using a composite score by a method from the PREGNANT trial (NCT00615550, Hassan et al). Scores of 0-3 reflect increasing numbers of morbidities or length of neonatal intensive care unit stay, and 4 represents perinatal mortality.A total of 5011 women were enrolled, with 847 included in this planned substudy analysis. There were 9 preterm birth cases at <320/7 weeks' gestation and 838 noncases at ≥320/7 weeks' gestation; 21 of 847 infants had neonatal composite morbidity and mortality index scores of ≥3, and 4 of 21 had a score of 4. The ratio of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 to sex hormone-binding globulin ratio was substantially higher in both preterm births at <320/7 weeks' gestation and there were more severe neonatal outcomes. The ratio of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 to sex hormone-binding globulin ratio was significantly predictive of birth at <320/7 weeks' gestation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.87; P=.016). Stratification by body mass index, optimized in the previous validation study (22<body mass index≤37 kg/m2), resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.93; P=.023). The ratio of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 to sex hormone-binding globulin ratio predicted neonatal outcomes with respective area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.77; P=.005) and 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.93; P=.026) for neonatal composite morbidity and mortality scores of ≥3 or 4. In addition, the ratio of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 to sex hormone binding globulin significantly stratified neonates with increased length of hospital stay (log rank P=.023).We confirmed in an independent cohort the ratio of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 to sex hormone-binding globulin ratio as a predictor of very preterm birth, with additional prediction of increased length of neonatal hospital stay and increased severity of adverse neonatal outcomes. Potential uses of the ratio of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 to sex hormone-binding globulin predictor may be to risk stratify patients for implementation of preterm birth preventive strategies and direct patients to appropriate levels of care.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, little is known about the impact of SES on recovery after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of SES on long-term recovery after stroke.In a prospective, observational, multicentre study, inpatients were recruited towards the end of rehabilitation. The 12-month follow-up focussed on upper limb motor recovery, measured by the Fugl-Meyer score. A clinically relevant improvement of ≥5.25 points was considered recovery. Patient-centric measures such as the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Physical Health (PROMIS-10 PH) provided secondary outcomes. Information on schooling, vocational training, income and occupational status pre-stroke entered a multidimensional SES index. Multivariate logistic regression models calculating odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were applied. SES was added to an initial model including age, sex and baseline neurological deficit. Additional exploratory analyses examined the association between SES and outpatient treatment.One hundred and seventy-six patients were enrolled of whom 98 had SES and long-term recovery data. Model comparisons showed the SES-model superior to the initial model (Akaike information criterion (AIC): 123 vs. 120, Pseudo R2: 0.09 vs. 0.13). The likelihood of motor recovery (OR = 17.12, 95%CI = 1.31; 224.18) and PROMIS-10 PH improvement (OR = 20.76, 95%CI = 1.28; 337.11) were significantly increased with higher SES, along with more frequent use of outpatient therapy (p = .02).Higher pre-stroke SES is associated with better long-term recovery after discharge from rehabilitation. Understanding these factors can improve outpatient long-term stroke care and lead to better recovery.KEY MESSAGEHigher pre-stroke socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with better long-term recovery after discharge from rehabilitation both in terms of motor function and self-reported health status.Higher SES is associated with significantly higher utilization of outpatient therapies.Discharge management of rehabilitation clinics should identify and address socioeconomic factors in order to detect individual needs and to improve outpatient recovery.

Herein, we investigated the diagnosis and prognosis roles of serum levels of 25(OHD) in suspected BC patients presented by hematuria.This prospective cohort study involved suspected patients of BC presented with hematuria. Patients were evaluated by CT urogram, office cystoscopy and urine cytology with subsequent inpatient biopsy for positive findings. Baseline blood samples were collected for measurement of 25(OHD) by electrochemiluminescence binding assay at the time of diagnosis. Patients with non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or BCG instillation.

The study aims to assess the risk of vascular infection by measuring atherosclerosis severity, NTS vascular infection (NTSVI) score, and serum levels of inflammatory markers in people with NTS bacteremia.A prospective observational study was conducted in two medical centers and two regional hospitals. Adults aged ≥50 years with NTS bacteremia who underwent computed tomography (CT) scan for revealing vascular infections were enrolled. The degree of atherosclerosis was scaled by a calcium score determined by a CT scan. Serum concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers were determined in the patients enrolled in a medical center.Fourteen (20.3%) of 69 patients with NTS bacteremia had vascular infections. Calcium scores over the thoracic (12,540 vs. 3,261, P = 0.0005) and abdominal (9755 vs. 3,461, P = 0.0006) aorta of those with vascular infections were higher than those without vascular infection. All vascular infections were present in the high-risk group (NTSVI score ≥1), yielding a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 30.9%. Among 17 low-risk patients (NTSVI score <1), none had vascular infections, resulting in a negative predictive value of 100%.

Whether patient health status after hospital discharge is a risk factor for surrogate PTSD symptoms is not known. Objectives: To determine the association between patient health status 90 days after the onset of CCI and surrogate symptoms of PTSD. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the data from a multicenter randomized trial of a communication intervention for adult patients with CCI and their surrogate decision-makers. Results: Surrogate PTSD symptoms were measured at 90 days using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised. For patients who were alive at 90 days, location was used as a marker of health status and included the following categories: 1) home (relatively good health and low acuity), 2) acute rehabilitation (moderate care needs and impairments, generally expected to improve), 3) skilled nursing facility (moderate care needs and impairments, generally not expected to improve significantly or quickly), 4) long-term acute care facility (persistently high acute care needs and functional impairment), and 5) readmission to an acute care hospital (suggesting the highest acuity of illness and care needs of the cohort). Patients who died before 90 days were categorized as deceased. In the analyses, 365 surrogates and 256 patients were included. Among patients, 49% were female, and the mean age was 59 years. Among surrogates, 71% were female, and the mean age was 51 years. A directed acyclic graph was constructed to identify covariates to be included in the model. Compared with symptoms seen among surrogates of patients living at home, heightened PTSD symptoms were seen among surrogates of patients who were readmitted to an acute care hospital (β coefficient, 15.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5 to 27.3) or had died (β coefficient, 14.8; 95% CI, 8.8 to 20.9) at 90 days. Conclusions: Surrogates of patients with CCI who have died or have been readmitted to an acute care hospital at 90 days experience increased PTSD symptoms as compared with surrogates of patients who are living at home.

To date, most studies have focused on tumor-intrinsic properties that render them ""immune-excluded"". Here, we explore an alternative, drug-induced mechanism that impedes therapeutic response via disrupting the onset of immunogenic cell death. Using two immune-excluded syngeneic mouse models of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), we show that platinum-based chemotherapy diminishes CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and constraines their antitumoral activity, despite expression of activation markers IFNγ and granzyme B. Mechanistically, chemotherapy induces the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from dying cancer cells, which is an inhibitory damage-associated molecular pattern (iDAMP) that hinderes dendritic cell maturation. Upon pharmaceutical blockade of PGE2 release, CD8+ T cells become tumoricidal and display an intraepithelial-infiltrating (or inflamed) pattern. This ""iDAMP blockade"" approach synergizes with chemotherapy and sensitizes bladder tumors towards anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. These findings provide a compelling rationale to evaluate this drug combination in future clinical trials.© 2022.

Our objective in this systematic review is to characterize the efficacy of these therapeutic agents by reporting their corresponding complete response rates and toxicity profiles.We conducted a systematic review of all available clinical trials evaluating therapies to treat recurring nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer after previous intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin failure patients who had previously failed 1 or more courses of prior bacillus Calmette-Guérin therapy were included. Studies that were not in the English language, included muscle-invasive bladder cancer patient populations, or lacked a post-treatment evaluation of response were excluded. We used PubMed/Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Embase to search for relevant studies. No formal risk of bias assessment was conducted. Complete response rates for 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-treatment evaluation, progression rates, cystectomy rates, and 12 complications are reported.A total of 70 studies with 73 reports evaluating 27 treatment options were retained for final analysis. These treatments were reported in 5 categories including intravesical chemotherapy, combination therapy, hyperthermia paired with intravesical chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and novel agents, with published years ranging from 1998 to 2021. Single intravesical chemotherapy and the combination of multiple intravesical chemotherapy agents demonstrate varied complete response rates of 10%-83% at 12 months. Limited clinical data evaluating hyperthermia paired with chemotherapy demonstrate 12-month complete response rates of 50%-85%. Despite these reported response rates, progression rates ranged from 0%-18%. Moreover, immunotherapeutic agents demonstrate progression rates of 7% to 22% at a median of 12 months of follow-up. Novel agents displayed a wide range of complete response rates (6% to 91%) at 12 months based on the treatment used. Total grade 3 toxicity rates range from 0%-55% for intravesical chemotherapy and combination intravesical chemotherapy agents, 0%-15% for hyperthermia paired with chemotherapy agents, 12%-13% for immunotherapy agents, and 0%-17% for novel agents.Bladder-preserving treatments accomplish moderate success in nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer following bacillus Calmette-Guérin failure. As the majority of available clinical trials are single-armed uncontrolled cohorts and contain a limited number of patients, strength and comparability of the data are limited. In general, intravesical chemotherapy and hyperthermia paired with mitomycin C demonstrate some of the highest complete response rates at 12 and 24 months. Similarly, among the pre-commercialized novel agents, N-803 and gene therapy display promising results and may serve as potential future treatment for nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer following failed bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment. In terms of toxicity/complication rates, both commercially available and unavailable treatments showcase low toxicity profiles for bladder cancer following bacillus Calmette-Guérin failure. The comprehensive analysis provided by this systematic review can serve as a reference for treatment decisions and clinical trial design in the bacillus Calmette-Guérin-unresponsive domain.",NA,7/09/2022,D000078182;D016428,10.1097/JU.0000000000002957,NA,1,1,,

However, MVI is hard to evaluate in patients without sufficient peri-tumoral tissue samples, which account for over a half of HCC patients.We established an MVI deep-learning (MVI-DL) model with a weakly supervised multiple-instance learning framework, to evaluate MVI status using only tumor tissues from the histological whole slide images (WSIs). A total of 350 HCC patients (2917 WSIs) from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (FAHSYSU cohort) were divided into a training and test set. One hundred and twenty patients (504 WSIs) from Dongguan People's Hospital and Shunde Hospital of Southern Medical University (DG-SD cohort) formed an external test set. Unsupervised clustering and class activation mapping were applied to visualize the key histological features.In the FAHSYSU and DG-SD test set, the MVI-DL model achieved an AUC of 0.904 (95% CI 0.888-0.920) and 0.871 (95% CI 0.837-0.905), respectively. Visualization results showed that macrotrabecular architecture with rich blood sinus, rich tumor stroma and high intratumor heterogeneity were identified as the key features associated with MVI ( +), whereas severe immune infiltration and highly differentiated tumor cells were associated with MVI (-). In the simulation of patients with only one WSI or biopsies only, the AUC of the MVI-DL model reached 0.875 (95% CI 0.855-0.895) and 0.879 (95% CI 0.853-0.906), respectively.The effective, interpretable MVI-DL model has potential as an important tool with practical clinical applicability in evaluating MVI status from the tumor areas on the histological slides.© 2022.

Methods: Patients from 3 different centers (n = 27, 29, and 8) were pooled to constitute the training set, whereas the patients from a fourth center (n = 23) were used as the testing set. The primary endpoint was local control. The primary tumor was semiautomatically delineated in the PET images using the fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian algorithm, and manually in the low-dose CT images. In total, 184 Image Biomarkers Standardization Initiative-compliant radiomic features were extracted. Seven clinical and treatment parameters were included. We used ComBat to harmonize radiomic features extracted from the 4 institutions relying on different PET/CT scanners. In the training set, variables found significant in the univariate analysis were fed into a multivariate regression model, and models were built by combining independent prognostic factors. Results: Median follow-up was 21.1 mo (range, 1.7-63.4 mo) and 25.5 mo (range, 7.7-57.8 mo) in training and testing sets, respectively. In univariate analysis, none of the clinical variables, 2 PET features, and 2 CT features were significantly predictive of local control. The best predictive models in the training set were obtained by combining one feature from PET (Information Correlation 2) and one feature from CT (flatness), reaching a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96%. Another model combining 2 PET features (Information Correlation 2 and strength) reached sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88%, both with an undefined hazard ratio (P < 0.001). The latter model obtained an accuracy of 0.91 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 81%), with a hazard ratio undefined (P = 0.023) in the testing set; however, other models relying on CT radiomic features only or the combination of PET and CT features failed to validate in the testing set. Conclusion: We showed that 2 radiomic features derived from 18F-FDG PET were independently associated with local control in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing SBRT and could be combined in an accurate predictive model. This model could provide local relapse-related information and could be helpful in clinical decision making.© 2020 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",NA,17/11/2019,D016428;D016448;D013485,10.2967/jnumed.119.228106,NA,1,1,,

Current tools have poor to fair predictive performance for intermediate (90-d) and long-term (1-yr) mortality.To develop predictive algorithms for spinal metastatic disease at these time points and to provide patient-specific explanations of the predictions generated by these algorithms.Retrospective review was conducted at 2 large academic medical centers to identify patients undergoing initial operative management for spinal metastatic disease between January 2000 and December 2016. Five models (penalized logistic regression, random forest, stochastic gradient boosting, neural network, and support vector machine) were developed to predict 90-d and 1-yr mortality.Overall, 732 patients were identified with 90-d and 1-yr mortality rates of 181 (25.1%) and 385 (54.3%), respectively. The stochastic gradient boosting algorithm had the best performance for 90-d mortality and 1-yr mortality. On global variable importance assessment, albumin, primary tumor histology, and performance status were the 3 most important predictors of 90-d mortality. The final models were incorporated into an open access web application able to provide predictions as well as patient-specific explanations of the results generated by the algorithms. The application can be found at https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/spinemetssurvival/.Preoperative estimation of 90-d and 1-yr mortality was achieved with assessment of more flexible modeling techniques such as machine learning.

In COPD, telemedicine appears to be a useful tool. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy (in improving health care-resource use and clinical outcomes) of a telemonitoring-based program (telEPOC) in COPD patients with frequent hospitalizations.We conducted a nonrandomized observational study in an intervention cohort of 119 patients (Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital) and a control cohort of 78 patients (Cruces Hospital), followed up for 2 years (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02528370). The inclusion criteria were two or more hospital admissions in the previous year or three or more admissions in the previous 2 years. The intervention group received telemonitoring plus education and controls usual care.Most participants were men (13% women), and the sample had a mean age of 70 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 45%, Charlson comorbidity index score of 3.5, and BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index score of 4.1.

Several deep learning-based computer-assisted detection (CADe) techniques were established from small single-center datasets, and unrepresentative learning materials might confine their application and generalization in wide practice. Although CADes have been reported to identify polyps in colonoscopic images and videos in real time, their diagnostic performance deserves to be further validated in clinical practice.To train and test a CADe based on multicenter high-quality images of polyps and preliminarily validate it in clinical colonoscopies.With high-quality screening and labeling from 55 qualified colonoscopists, a dataset consisting of over 71000 images from 20 centers was used to train and test a deep learning-based CADe. In addition, the real-time diagnostic performance of CADe was tested frame by frame in 47 unaltered full-ranged videos that contained 86 histologically confirmed polyps. Finally, we conducted a self-controlled observational study to validate the diagnostic performance of CADe in real-world colonoscopy with the main outcome measure of polyps per colonoscopy in Changhai Hospital.The CADe was able to identify polyps in the test dataset with 95.0% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. For colonoscopy videos, all 86 polyps were detected with 92.2% sensitivity and 93.6% specificity in frame-by-frame analysis. In the prospective validation, the sensitivity of CAD in identifying polyps was 98.4% (185/188). Folds, reflections of light and fecal fluid were the main causes of false positives in both the test dataset and clinical colonoscopies. Colonoscopists can detect more polyps (0.90 vs 0.82, P < 0.001) and adenomas (0.32 vs 0.30, P = 0.045) with the aid of CADe, particularly polyps < 5 mm and flat polyps (0.65 vs 0.57, P < 0.001; 0.74 vs 0.67, P = 0.001, respectively). However, high efficacy is not realized in colonoscopies with inadequate bowel preparation and withdrawal time (P = 0.32; P = 0.16, respectively).CADe is feasible in the clinical setting and might help endoscopists detect more polyps and adenomas, and further confirmation is warranted.©The Author(s) 2021.

We aimed to analyse the amplitude distribution and undersensing rate during spontaneous episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF), and define a safety amplitude threshold for baseline R-waves.Data were obtained from an observational multicentre registry conducted at 48 centres in Spain. Baseline R-wave amplitudes and VF events were prospectively registered by remote monitoring. Signal processing algorithms were used to compare amplitudes of baseline R-waves with VF R-waves. All undersensed R-waves after the blanking period (120 ms) were manually marked.We studied 2507 patients from August 2011 to September 2014, which yielded 229 VF episodes (cycle length 189.6±29.1 ms) from 83 patients that were suitable for R-wave comparisons (follow-up 2.7±2.6 years). The majority (77.6%) of VF R-waves (n=13953) showed lower amplitudes than the reference baseline R-wave. The decrease in VF amplitude was progressively attenuated among subgroups of baseline R-wave amplitude (≥17; ≥12 to <17; ≥7 to <12; ≥2.2 to <7 mV) from the highest to the lowest: median deviations -51.2% to +22.4%, respectively (p=0.027). There were no significant differences in undersensing rates of VF R-waves among subgroups. Both the normalised histogram distribution and the undersensing risk function obtained from the ≥2.2 to <7 mV subgroup enabled the prediction that baseline R-wave amplitudes ≤2.5 mV (interquartile range: 2.3-2.8 mV) may lead to ≥25% of undersensed VF R-waves.Baseline R-wave amplitudes ≤2.5 mV during follow-up of patients with ICDs may lead to high risk of delayed detection of VF.NCT01561144; results.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In our Linear Mixed Model (LMM) analysis, time×group interactions were significant in the PANSS positive subscale (p=0.003) (not being the corresponding behavioral output for DLPFC stimulation), the PANSS general subscale (p<0.001), the PANSS total scale (p=0.015), but not the PANSS negative subscale (p=0.301) (primary endpoint of the RESIS trial), when all PANSS measurements from screening to day 105 were included. Descriptive data suggests that in the active group the improvement was more pronounced compared to the sham rTMS group.In this largest available clozapine cohort, active rTMS may be more effective than sham rTMS when added to clozapine for positive and total psychotic symptoms. These findings should be interpreted with caution given this is a secondary analysis with a limited number of participants.Copyright © 2019.

With the lack of epidemiological studies in the region, we aim to describe the prevalence of BRCA1/BRCA2 PSVs in patients with OC across different countries in the Gulf region.The PREDICT study was an observational, prospective, epidemiological study, which consecutively recruited women with ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers from the following Gulf countries over the period from July 2017 to July 2019; United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, and Oman. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of participating centers. The BRCA1/BRCA2 PSVs were assessed by tissue genetic testing using next-generation sequencing (NGS).A total of 105 women were included with a median age at diagnosis of 52 years (IQR 44.5 - 61.0). Nearly 11.4% of patients reported a family history of ovarian or breast cancer, while 4.7% of patients reported a family history of other cancers. Most of the patients (70.3%) had advanced disease (FIGO stage III/IV) at presentation. Eighty-eight patients (84%) were successfully tested for somatic BRCA1/BRCA2 PSVs. Fifteen patients (17%) were found to have PSVs in either BRCA1, BRCA2, or both genes; of them, 10 patients (11.2%) had BRCA1 somatic PSVs alone, eight patients (9.1%) had BRCA2 somatic PSVs, while three patients (2.9%) had both PSVs. Five patients with BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic PSVs had germline PSVs tests, and three of them tested positive. Concerning treatment, 87.6% of patients received perioperative chemotherapy and 6.6% as first-line palliative chemotherapy. Eighty-seven (82.9%) patients underwent debulking surgery, with no residual disease in 42.5% of patients.Our study showed that the prevalence of BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic PSVs in patients with OC is higher than the reported global figures (2-8%). However, more studies are warranted to further elucidate the prevalence of BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic and germline PSVs, as well as other relevant genetic alterations, to better understand their impact on OC patient outcomes in Gulf countries.NCT03082976 .© 2021.

However, the complexity of continuous EEG data limits timely and accurate interpretation by clinicians. We develop a deep neural network (DNN) model to leverage complex EEG trends for early and accurate assessment of cardiac arrest coma recovery likelihood.We developed a multiscale DNN combining convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (long short-term memory [LSTM]) using EEG and demographic information (age, gender, shockable rhythm) from a multicenter cohort of 1,038 cardiac arrest patients. The CNN learns EEG feature representations while the multiscale LSTM captures short-term and long-term EEG dynamics on multiple time scales. Poor outcome is defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of 3-5 and good outcome as CPC score 1-2 at 3-6 months after cardiac arrest. Performance is evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration error.Model performance increased with EEG duration, with AUC increasing from 0.83 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.79-0.87 at 12h to 0.91 (95%CI 0.88-0.93) at 66h. Sensitivity of good and poor outcome prediction was 77% and 75% at a specificity of 90%, respectively. Sensitivity of poor outcome was 50% at a specificity of 99%. Predicted probability was well matched to the observation frequency of poor outcomes, with a calibration error of 0.11 [0.09-0.14].These results demonstrate that incorporating EEG evolution over time improves the accuracy of neurologic outcome prediction for patients with coma after cardiac arrest.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The prevalence of referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), glaucoma suspect (GCS), and referable macular diseases (RMD) were 20.4%, 23.2%, and 49.0%, respectively. The overall sensitivity values for RDR, GCS, and RMD diagnosis are 0.948 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.918-0.967), 0.891 (95% CI, 0.855-0.919), and 0.901 (95% CI-0.878, 0.920), respectively. The overall specificity values for RDR, GCS, and RMD diagnosis are 0.954 (95% CI, 0.915-0.965), 0.993 (95% CI-0.986, 0.996), and 0.955 (95% CI-0.939, 0.968), respectively.We prospectively enrolled 1743 subjects at seven hospitals throughout China. At each hospital, an operator records the subjects' information, takes fundus images, and submits the images to the Image Reading Center of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-Sen University (IRC). The IRC grades the images according to the study protocol. Meanwhile, these images will also be automatically screened by the artificial intelligence algorithm. Then, the analysis results of automated screening algorithm are compared against the grading results of IRC. The end point goals are lower bounds of 95% CI of sensitivity values that are greater than 0.85 for all three target diseases, and lower bounds of 95% CI of specificity values that are greater than 0.90 for RDR and 0.85 for GCS and RMD.Automated fundus screening software demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting RDR, GCS, and RMD from color fundus imaged captured using various cameras.These findings suggest that automated software can improve the screening effectiveness for eye diseases, especially in a primary care context, where experienced ophthalmologists are scarce.",NA,27/07/2022,D016428;D016448;D013485,10.1167/tvst.11.7.22,NA,1,1,,

We sought to assess whether immunosuppressive treatments were associated with reduced antibody and T-cell responses in patients with IBD after a third vaccine dose.VIP was a multicentre, prospective, case-control study done in nine centres in the UK. We recruited immunosuppressed patients with IBD and non-immunosuppressed healthy individuals. All participants were aged 18 years or older. The healthy control group had no diagnosis of IBD and no current treatment with systemic immunosuppressive therapy for any other indication. The immunosuppressed patients with IBD had an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or unclassified IBD using standard definitions of IBD, and were receiving established treatment with one of six immunosuppressive regimens for at least 12 weeks at the time of first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. All participants had to have received three doses of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody binding and T-cell responses were measured in all participant groups. The primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1 receptor binding domain [RBD]) antibody concentration 28-49 days after the third vaccine dose, adjusted by age, homologous versus heterologous vaccine schedule, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome was assessed in all participants with available data.Between Oct 18, 2021, and March 29, 2022, 352 participants were included in the study (thiopurine n=65, infliximab n=46, thiopurine plus infliximab combination therapy n=49, ustekinumab n=44, vedolizumab n=50, tofacitinib n=26, and healthy controls n=72). Geometric mean anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD antibody concentrations increased in all groups following a third vaccine dose, but were significantly lower in patients treated with infliximab (2736·8 U/mL [geometric SD 4·3]; p<0·0001), infliximab plus thiopurine (1818·3 U/mL [6·7]; p<0·0001), and tofacitinib (8071·5 U/mL [3·1]; p=0·0018) compared with the healthy control group (16 774·2 U/mL [2·6]). There were no significant differences in anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD antibody concentrations between the healthy control group and patients treated with thiopurine (12 019·7 U/mL [2·2]; p=0·099), ustekinumab (11 089·3 U/mL [2·8]; p=0·060), or vedolizumab (13 564·9 U/mL [2·4]; p=0·27). In multivariable modelling, lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD antibody concentrations were independently associated with infliximab (geometric mean ratio 0·15 [95% CI 0·11-0·21]; p<0·0001), tofacitinib (0·52 [CI 0·31-0·87]; p=0·012), and thiopurine (0·69 [0·51-0·95]; p=0·021), but not with ustekinumab (0·64 [0·39-1·06]; p=0·083), or vedolizumab (0·84 [0·54-1·30]; p=0·43). Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (1·58 [1·22-2·05]; p=0·0006) was independently associated with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD antibody concentrations and older age (0·88 [0·80-0·97]; p=0·0073) was independently associated with lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD antibody concentrations. Antigen-specific T-cell responses were similar in all groups, except for recipients of tofacitinib without evidence of previous infection, where T-cell responses were significantly reduced relative to healthy controls (p=0·021).A third dose of COVID-19 vaccine induced a boost in antibody binding in immunosuppressed patients with IBD, but these responses were reduced in patients taking infliximab, infliximab plus thiopurine, and tofacitinib. Tofacitinib was also associated with reduced T-cell responses. These findings support continued prioritisation of immunosuppressed groups for further vaccine booster dosing, particularly patients on anti-TNF and JAK inhibitors.Pfizer.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

This study aimed to analyze characteristics of nonagenarian patients with ACS and to compare in-hospital and 1-year clinical outcomes between those treated with medical treatment (MT) alone and those receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Multicenter observational study.We included consecutive nonagenarian patients with ACS admitted at 4 academic centers between 2005 and 2018. Only patients with type 1 myocardial infarction were included.Standardized definitions of all patient-related variables, clinical diagnoses, and hospital complications and outcomes were used. The primary endpoint was 1-year all-cause mortality. Long-term survival was compared between patients undergoing PCI and those managed with MT alone. Given differences in baseline characteristics could substantially interfere in outcomes, 3 sensitivity analyses were performed to adjust for confounders.A total of 680 nonagenarians were included (59% females). Of them, 373 (55%) patients presented with non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) and 307 (45%) with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A coronary angiogram was performed in 115 (31%) of NSTE-ACS and in 182 (60%) of STEMI patients with subsequent PCI in 81 (22%) and 156 (51%), respectively. Overall mortality rates were 17% in-hospital and 39% at 1-year follow-up. PCI was independently associated with a decreased risk of 1-year all-cause death [hazard ratio (HR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35, 0.95; P < .05], mainly observed in those patients without disability (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37, 0.94; P < .01) and lower Killip class (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28, 0.89; P < .001).The prognosis of nonagenarians after an ACS was associated with comorbidities and the therapeutic approach. Although PCI appeared to be a safe and effective strategy, it is still necessary to refine the decision-making process in this high-risk population group.Copyright © 2021 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

Undiagnosed DM is not uncommon and can lead to severe complications and mortality. Identifying high-risk individuals at an earlier disease stage, that is, pre-diabetes (pre-DM), is crucial in delaying progression. Existing risk models mainly rely on non-modifiable factors to predict only the DM risk, and few apply to Chinese people. This study aims to develop and validate a risk prediction function that incorporates modifiable lifestyle factors to detect DM and pre-DM in Chinese adults in primary care.A cross-sectional study to develop DM/Pre-DM risk prediction functions using data from the Hong Kong's Population Health Survey (PHS) 2014/2015 and a 12-month prospective study to validate the functions in case finding of individuals with DM/pre-DM. Data of 1857 Chinese adults without self-reported DM/Pre-DM will be extracted from the PHS 2014/2015 to develop DM/Pre-DM risk models using logistic regression and machine learning methods. 1014 Chinese adults without a known history of DM/Pre-DM will be recruited from public and private primary care clinics in Hong Kong. They will complete a questionnaire on relevant risk factors and blood tests on Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) on recruitment and, if the first blood test is negative, at 12 months. A positive case is DM/pre-DM defined by OGTT or HbA1c in any blood test. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the models in detecting DM/pre-DM will be calculated.Ethics approval has been received from The University of Hong Kong/Hong Kong Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW19-831) and Hong Kong Hospital Authority Kowloon Central/Kowloon East Cluster (REC(KC/KE)-21-0042/ER-3).

Follow up was performed 180 days after hospital discharge. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for the various subgroups created. For all comparisons, a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.BNP median (interquartile range (IQR)) value at admission was 822 (412 - 1390) pg\mL; at 24 hours was 593 (270 - 1953) and at discharge was 325 (160 - 725).

The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines identified anthropometric nutritional red flags for neurologically impaired children: weight for age z-score (WFA) < -2, triceps skinfold (TSF) or arm muscle area (AMA) < 10th centile and faltering weight. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the nutritional status of Flemish children and adolescents with CP using different anthropometric indicators; (2) assess the prevalence of nutritional red flags and (3) identify risk factors for low anthropometric parameters.This study was a prospective, longitudinal observational study recruiting children and adolescents with CP (2-20 years) in 9 specialized Flemish centres. Measurements were performed at baseline (t1, n = 325), after 6 (t2, total n = 268) and 12 months (t3, total n = 191). WFA z-scores were based on Flemish growth charts; TSF, subscapular skinfolds (SSF) and AMA compared with US reference data. Weight faltering was defined as ≥0.5 decrease in weight SDS at t2 or t3.At t1 50 patients (15.4%) were classified as gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) 1, 95 (29.2%) as GMFCS 2, 49 (15.1%) as GMFCS 3, 54 (16.6%) as GMFCS 4, and 77 (23.7%) as GMFCS 5. The overall median (Q1; Q3) age was 11.7 (8.2; 15.9) years; 61.5% were boys and 22 (6.8%) had a gastrostomy (17 (22.1%) of GMFCS 5 group). The median (Q1; Q3) WFA z-score was -1.13 (-2.6; -0.1); 71.4% of the GMFCS 5 children had a WFA z-score < -2. The median (Q1; Q3) MUAC z-score was 0.17 (-0.7; 1.0); 16.9% of the GFMCS 5 children had MUAC z-score < -2. Median (Q1; Q3) TSF and SSF z-scores were respectively -0.01 (-0.8; 0.9) and 0.27 (-0.3; 0.9). All anthropometric indices tended to decrease with increasing GMFCS (p < 0.001). At t1 42.1% had at least one nutritional red flag, at t2 40.3% and at t3 41.4%. Of those with at least one nutritional red flag at t1 or t2, respectively 14.7% and 18.8% suffered weight loss 6 months later. A GMFCS >2 and dysphagia were associated with a higher risk for lower scores of nearly all nutritional indices.Underweight was detected in almost three quarters of CP patients with GMFCS 5 classification, whereas deficits in subcutaneous fat and arm muscle reserve were observed in one fifth. Nutritional red flags, present in about 40% of the Flemish CP children, were apparently not successfully addressed in clinical practice, since up to one-fifth of CP patients with warning signs lost even further weight in the following 6 months. Beside a GMFCS >2, dysphagia was one of the most common conditions influencing the presence of low nutritional indices.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Biomarker profiling emerges as a promising tool for the early diagnosis and risk stratification of either DM or CAD. However, studies assessing the predictive capacity of novel metabolomics biomarkers in coexistent CAD and DM are scarce.This post-hoc analysis of the CorLipid trial (NCT04580173) included 316 patients with CAD and comorbid DM who underwent emergency or elective coronary angiography due to acute or chronic coronary syndrome. Cox regression analyses were performed to identify metabolomic predictors of the primary outcome, which was defined as the composite of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding), repeat unplanned revascularizations and cardiovascular hospitalizations. Linear regression analyses were also performed to detect significant predictors of CAD complexity, as assessed by the SYNTAX score.After a median 2-year follow up period (IQR = 0.7 years), the primary outcome occurred in 69 (21.8%) of patients. Acylcarnitine ratio C4/C18:2, apolipoprotein (apo) B, history of heart failure (HF), age > 65 years and presence of acute coronary syndrome were independent predictors of the primary outcome in diabetic patients with CAD (aHR = 1.89 [1.09, 3.29]; 1.02 [1.01, 1.04]; 1.28 [1.01, 1.41]; 1.04 [1.01, 1.05]; and 1.12 [1.05-1.21], respectively). Higher levels of ceramide ratio C24:1/C24:0, acylcarnitine ratio C4/C18:2, age > 65 and peripheral artery disease were independent predictors of higher CAD complexity (adjusted β = 7.36 [5.74, 20.47]; 3.02 [0.09 to 6.06]; 3.02 [0.09, 6.06], respectively), while higher levels of apoA1 were independent predictors of lower complexity (adjusted β= - 0.65 [- 1.31, - 0.02]).In patients with comorbid DM and CAD, novel metabolomic biomarkers and metabolomics-based prediction models could be recruited to predict clinical outcomes and assess the complexity of CAD, thereby enabling the integration of personalized medicine into routine clinical practice. These associations should be interpreted taking into account the observational nature of this study, and thus, larger trials are needed to confirm its results and validate them in different and larger diabetic populations.© 2022.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-I) currently receive intense clinical interest in patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM) for their pleiotropic beneficial effects. We tested the hypothesis that SGLT2-I have anti-inflammatory effects along with glucose-lowering properties. Therefore, we investigated the link between stress hyperglycemia, inflammatory burden, and infarct size in a cohort of type 2 diabetic patients presenting with AMI treated with SGLT2-I versus other oral anti-diabetic (OAD) agents.In this multicenter international observational registry, consecutive diabetic AMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between 2018 and 2021 were enrolled. Based on the presence of anti-diabetic therapy at the admission, patients were divided into those receiving SGLT2-I (SGLT-I users) versus other OAD agents (non-SGLT2-I users). The following inflammatory markers were evaluated at different time points: white-blood-cell count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR), and C-reactive protein. Infarct size was assessed by echocardiography and by peak troponin levels.The study population consisted of 583 AMI patients (with or without ST-segment elevation): 98 SGLT2-I users and 485 non-SGLT-I users. Hyperglycemia at admission was less prevalent in the SGLT2-I group. Smaller infarct size was observed in patients treated with SGLT2-I compared to non-SGLT2-I group. On admission and at 24 h, inflammatory indices were significantly higher in non-SGLT2-I users compared to SGLT2-I patients, with a significant increase in neutrophil levels at 24 h. At multivariable analysis, the use of SGLT2-I was a significant predictor of reduced inflammatory response (OR 0.457, 95% CI 0.275-0.758, p = 0.002), independently of age, admission creatinine values, and admission glycemia. Conversely, peak troponin values and NSTEMI occurrence were independent predictors of a higher inflammatory status.Type 2 diabetic AMI patients receiving SGLT2-I exhibited significantly reduced inflammatory response and smaller infarct size compared to those receiving other OAD agents, independently of glucose-metabolic control.

However, their performance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) might differ from the general population. This cross-sectional multicentre study aimed to estimate the 10-year CV risk using two different algorithms in a large RA cohort and in patients with osteoarthritis (OA).In a consecutive series of RA patients and matched OA controls without prior CV events, clinical and serologic data and traditional CV risk factors were recorded. The 10-year CV risk was assessed with the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) and the ""Progetto Cuore"" algorithms.1,467 RA patients and 342 OA subjects were included. RA patients were more frequently diabetic (9.9% vs 6.4%; p=0.04) and smokers (20.4% vs 12.5%; p=0.002) but had lower prevalence of obesity (15% vs 21%; p=0.003). Dyslipidaemia was more prevalent in OA (32.5% vs 21.7%; p<0.0001). The 10-year estimated CV risk was 1.6% (95%CI 1.3-1.9) in RA and 1.4% (95%CI 1.3-1.6) in OA (p=0.002) according to SCORE and 6.5% (95%CI 6.1-6.9) in RA and 4.4% (95%CI 3.9-5.1) in OA (p<0.001) according to ""Progetto Cuore"". Regardless of the score used, RA patients had a 3- to-4-fold increased 10-year risk of CV events compared to OA subjects.RA patients have a significantly higher 10-year risk of CV events than OA subjects. In addition to effective disease control and joint damage prevention, specific protective measures targeting modifiable traditional CV risk factors should be implemented in RA.Copyright © 2021.

Factor V Leiden (FVL or rs6025) and prothrombin gene G20210A (PT or rs1799963) are the genetic variants currently tested for VTE risk assessment. We hypothesized that primary VTE risk assessment can be improved by using genetic risk scores with more genetic markers than just FVL-rs6025 and prothrombin gene PT-rs1799963. To this end, we have designed a new genetic risk score called Thrombo inCode (TiC).TiC was evaluated in terms of discrimination (Δ of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and reclassification (integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement). This evaluation was performed using 2 age- and sex-matched case-control populations: SANTPAU (248 cases, 249 controls) and the Marseille Thrombosis Association study (MARTHA; 477 cases, 477 controls). TiC was compared with other literature-based genetic risk scores.

TiC showed good integrated discrimination improvement of 5.49 (P<0.001) for SANTPAU and 0.96 (P=0.045) for MARTHA. Among the genetic risk scores evaluated, the proportion of VTE risk variance explained by TiC was the highest.We conclude that TiC greatly improves prediction of VTE risk compared with other genetic risk scores. TiC should improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE.© 2014 The Authors.

Propensity score matching can be used to match belimumab-treated patients from LTE studies with standard therapy-treated patients from observational cohort studies. This analysis was designed to compare organ damage progression between treatment groups (belimumab plus standard therapy vs standard therapy alone) in patients with SLE with ≥5 years of follow-up, reproducing our previous study with more generalisable data.This exploratory post hoc analysis used a heterogeneous population of US and non-US patients receiving monthly intravenous belimumab from pooled BLISS LTE trials (BEL112234/NCT00712933) and standard therapy-treated patients from the Toronto Lupus Cohort. Sixteen clinical variables were selected to calculate the propensity score.The 592 LTE and 381 Toronto Lupus Cohort patients were highly dissimilar across the 16 variables; an adequately balanced sample of 181 LTE and 181 matched Toronto Lupus Cohort patients (mean bias=3.7%) was created using propensity score matching. Belimumab treatment was associated with a smaller increase in Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) over 5 years than standard therapy alone (mean treatment difference=-0.453 (95% CI -0.646 to -0.260); p<0.001). Patients treated with belimumab were 60% less likely to progress to a higher SDI score over any given year of follow-up, compared with standard therapy alone (HR (95% CI) 0.397 (0.275 to 0.572); p<0.001).Using propensity score matching, this highly heterogeneous sample was sufficiently matched to the Toronto Lupus Cohort, suggesting that patients treated with intravenous belimumab may have reduced organ damage progression versus standard therapy alone. This analysis of a large and diverse pooled SLE population was consistent with our previously published US-focused study.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

The age-standardised incidence (ASRi) of CRC in populations in the year of screening was derived from the Cancer Statistics.One hundred sixty-six observational studies and 60 experimental studies were identified. Most studies applied cascade screening with faecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) as an initial test. The adherence to colonoscopy varied greatly across populations by continents, gross national income and type of initial tests, with a median (interquartile range) of 79.8% (63.1%-87.8%) in observational studies and 82.1% (66.7%-90.4%) in randomised trials. The adherence was positively correlated with the ASRi of CRC (r = 0.145, p = 0.023) and positive predictive value (PPV) of the initial tests (r = 0.206, p = 0.002) in observational studies and correlated with ASRi of CRC (r = 0.309, p = 0.002) and sensitivity of the initial tests (r = -0.704, p = 0.003) in experimental studies.Adherence to colonoscopy varies greatly across populations and is related with performance of the initial tests, indicating the importance to select appropriate initial tests.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","c(""# PW2019A-5"", ""Health Commission of Pudong New Area of Shanghai"", """")|c(""Local High Level University Construction Project of Shanghai"", """")",23/03/2022,D016428;D016454,10.1111/ecc.13577,NA,1,1,,

Similarly, prediction of Glasgow Outcome Score 1-3 was improved from 0.68 to 0.87 when including dynamic information.The dynamic information in continuous mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure monitoring allows to accurately predict increased intracranial pressure in the neuro-ICU.

Abnormal uterine artery Doppler was defined as uterine artery pulsatility index > 95th percentile or ≥ 2 SD above the mean, or bilateral uterine artery notching. Hierarchical summary receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed using random-effects modeling. Bayesian analysis was used to calculate the posterior probability of adverse perinatal outcome following an abnormal or normal uterine artery Doppler assessment.Seventeen observational studies (including 7552 fetuses either diagnosed with suspected SGA (n = 3461) or later diagnosed as a SGA neonate (n = 4091)) met the inclusion criteria; no randomized-controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Summary ROC curves showed that, among suspected SGA fetuses, the best predictive accuracy of abnormal third-trimester uterine artery Doppler was for perinatal mortality and the worst was for composite adverse perinatal outcome, with areas under the summary ROC curves of 0.90 and 0.66, respectively. The corresponding positive and negative likelihood ratios were 16.5 and 0.6 for perinatal mortality and 2.82 and 0.65 for composite adverse perinatal outcome, respectively. Following an abnormal vs normal uterine artery Doppler assessment, the posterior risks for composite adverse perinatal outcome, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, Cesarean section for intrapartum fetal compromise, 5-min Apgar score < 7, neonatal acidosis and perinatal death were: 52.3% vs 20.2%, 48.6% vs 18.7%, 23.1% vs 15.2%, 3.59% vs 1.32%, 9.15% vs 5.12% and 31.4% vs 1.64%, respectively.Abnormal uterine artery Doppler in the third trimester appears to be moderately useful in predicting perinatal death in pregnancies with suspected SGA.

Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and antenatal hospitalization; several risk factors including intrauterine infections have been identified, but its real causes remain poorly understood.This is a retrospective, multicenter, cohort study including 250 women admitted for threatened preterm labor. Methods, Participants/Materials, Setting: All women admitted for threatened preterm labor, i.e., presenting with cervical changes and uterine activity before 37 weeks at the obstetrics unit of the hospitals of Modena, Monza, Carate, and Vimercate were included in the study. We excluded twin pregnancies and cases with preterm premature rupture of membranes at admission. Data about maternal history, pregnancy complications, cervical length, vaginal swabs, and urine culture at admission and gestational age at delivery were collected from clinical records in order to compare the incidence of preterm birth according to some known risk factors, cervical length, and microbiological test at admission.250 women were included in the study; preterm birth at less than 37 weeks occurred in 44.4% women admitted for threatened preterm labor. The incidence of preterm birth was not different between those with a positive or a negative vaginal swab (48.3 vs. 38.4%, p = 0.22) or positive versus negative urine culture (31.8 vs. 42.1%, p = 0.23) at admission. A shorter cervical length at admission was found in women with subsequent preterm birth (17 vs. 19.5 mm, p = 0.03). Cervical length <15 mm (OR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03-3.23, p = 0.039) predicted the risk of preterm birth. Furthermore, only the history of a previous preterm birth (p = 0.02) and a previous uterine curettage (p = 0.045) was associated with preterm birth.The observational and retrospective nature of the study and its small sample size are important limitations of the study. Moreover, women were not systematically or randomly assigned to the screening for vaginal or urinary infections.There is no evidence that the search for vaginal or urinary infections in women admitted for threatened preterm labor is helpful to identify those at increased risk of preterm birth. Although several studies have explored the role of screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic women and some studies evaluated vaginal or urinary infections in women with preterm birth, none of them focused on the possible role of microbiological specimens as a predictive tool in women admitted for threatened PTL. No association was found in our study, but prospective randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the results of this observation.© 2022 S.

However, the systems are based on the nonpregnant adult population. The aim of this study was to create a highly accurate scoring system that can be applied to pregnant women and to compare it to the most commonly used scores in general population and pregnant women. The creation and subsequent implementation of a highly accurate score system could shorten the diagnostic period and minimize the use of (ionizing) diagnostic imaging allowing the selection of the best treatment approach in pregnant patients with acute appendicitis. A single-center, retrospective cohort observational study was conducted at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia. Data were extracted from medical records of pregnant patients with suspected AA from January 2010 to December 2020. A total of 59 pregnant patients diagnosed with AA during pregnancy were identified, 41 were treated surgically, and 18 had non-surgical management. The main objective of our study was the detection of predictive factors of AA during pregnancy. Anorexia, pain migration to the right lower quadrant, rebound pain, axillary temperature over 37.3 °C, CRP/platelet ratio > 0.0422, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio > 7.182, and ultrasonic signs of AA were scored. Scoring in Appendicitis TriMOdal Score (ATMOS) consists of positive clinical parameter, each bringing 1 point and other parameters mentioned above that bring 2 points each. The score ranges from 0 to 10. Our model of ATMOS yields a high area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.963. The positive likelihood ratio is 9.97 (95% CI 2.64-38.00), and the negative likelihood ratio is 0.1 (95% CI 0.03-0.31), meaning that 94% of cases with ATMOS > 4 have AA, while less than 13% with an ATMOS ≤ 4 have the diagnosis of AA. The potential of ATMOS differentiating AA during pregnancy was demonstrated. Future prospective, randomized trials are needed to evaluate its accuracy and whether it should be used instead of Alvarado or Tzanakis scores in clinical decision-making.Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov-NCT05202483.

The ANTCP patient cohort was defined using medical data from January 2015 to January 2016. A retrospective study was performed among 300 ANTCP patients. Diagnostic accuracy to predict MACE, HEART risk score effectiveness and patient risk stratification were analysed on the ANTCP Cohort. HEART risk score was conducted on ANTCP Cohort data and patients were stratified as low-risk (n = 116, 38.7%), moderate-risk (n = 164, 54.7%) and high-risk (n = 20, 6.7%); differently from the assessment performed by 'Current Emergency Department Guidelines' (CEDG) on the same patients: low risk and discharge (n = 56, 18.7%), medium risk and need of complementary tests (n = 137, 45.7%) and high risk and hospital admission (n = 107, 35.7%).The incidence of MACE was 2.5%, 20.7% and 100% in low, moderate and high-risk, respectively. Discrimination and accuracy indexes were moderate (AUC = 0.73, 95% confidence interval: 0.67-0.80). Clustering moderate-high risk groups by MACE incidence showed an 89.5% of sensitivity. Data obtained from this study suggests that HEART risk score stratified better 'acute non-traumatic chest pain' (ANTCP) patients in an Emergency Department (ED) compared with 'Current Emergency Department Guidelines' (CEDG) at the Hospital Universitari Arnau de Vilanova (HUAV).

However, since the recent incorporation of new advances in its management, little is known about the cost of stroke. The aim of this study is to find out the real cost of stroke in Spain.This is an epidemiological, observational, prospective, multicenter study of patients diagnosed with stroke and admitted to a stroke unit. Patients were recruited from 16 hospitals throughout Spain and followed up for 1 year. Sociodemographic, clinical, and economic data were collected. Costs (€ 2012) were estimated from the social perspective and were divided into direct healthcare (inpatient, outpatient, and medication), direct non-healthcare (mainly formal and informal care) and labor productivity losses.A total of 321 patients were included. Mean age was 72.1 years and 176 patients (54.8 %) were male. Total average cost per patient/year was €27,711. Direct healthcare costs amounted to €8491 per patient/year (68.8 % due to inpatient costs) and non-healthcare costs to an average of €18,643 per patient/year (89.5 % due to informal care). Productivity loss costs per patient/year were €276. Total costs of hemorrhagic strokes were slightly higher than ischemic (€28,895 vs. €27,569 per patient/year, p = 0.550) without significant differences. The main variables associated with higher costs were the presence of hypertension (€30,332 vs. €23,234 per patient/year, p < 0.05) and the severity of stroke (p < 0.05), both independently associated after a multivariate analysis.The cost of patients admitted to stroke units in Spain is €27,711 per patient/year.

Identifying predictors associated with poor treatment response is important for a personalized treatment approach. Childhood trauma (CT) may have a general and differential effect on the effectiveness of different types of antipsychotics in SSDs. The Bergen-Stavanger-Trondheim-Innsbruck (BeSt InTro) study is a pragmatic, researcher-initiated, semi-randomized trial. The present study aimed to investigate symptom change (the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) from baseline to 1, 3, 6, 12, 26, 39 and 52 weeks of antipsychotic treatment (amisulpride, aripiprazole and olanzapine) by group (CT/no CT). Participants (n = 98) with diagnoses within the schizophrenia spectrum (F20-29 in the International Classification of Diseases - 10th Revision) were randomized to receive amisulpride, aripiprazole or olanzapine, and for this study categorized into groups of none and low CT, and moderate to severe CT according to thresholds defined by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short-Form manual. CT in SSDs predicted an overall slower treatment response and less antipsychotic effectiveness after 26 weeks of treatment, which was statistically nonsignificant at 52 weeks. Secondary analyses showed a differential effect of CT related to type of antipsychotic medication: patients with SSDs and CT who received olanzapine showed less antipsychotic effectiveness throughout 52 weeks of treatment. The intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were convergent. Our findings indicate that in patients with SSD and CT, delayed response to antipsychotics could be expected, and a longer evaluation period before considering change of medication may be recommended.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Starting from the hypothesis that immune cells promptly respond to harmful stimuli, we used peripheral blood monocytes in order to characterise a distinct gene expression profile and to evaluate its potential as a candidate diagnostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), a still unmet clinical need.We performed a case-control study including 360 peripheral blood monocyte samples from four European oncological centres and defined a gene expression profile specific to CRC. The robustness of the genetic profile and disease specificity were assessed in an independent setting.This screen returned 43 putative diagnostic markers, which we refined and validated in the confirmative multicentric analysis to 23 genes with outstanding diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC)=0.99 (0.99 to 1.00), Se=100.0% (100.0% to 100.0%), Sp=92.9% (78.6% to 100.0%) in multiple-gene receiver operating characteristic analysis). The diagnostic accuracy was robustly maintained in prospectively collected independent samples (AUC=0.95 (0.85 to 1.00), Se=92.6% (81.5% to 100.0%), Sp=92.3% (76.9% to 100.0%). This monocyte signature was expressed at early disease onset, remained robust over the course of disease progression, and was specific for the monocytic fraction of mononuclear cells. The gene modulation was induced specifically by soluble factors derived from transformed colon epithelium in comparison to normal colon or other cancer histotypes. Moreover, expression changes were plastic and reversible, as they were abrogated upon withdrawal of these tumour-released factors. Consistently, the modified set of genes reverted to normal expression upon curative treatment and was specific for CRC.Our study is the first to demonstrate monocyte plasticity in response to tumour-released soluble factors. The identified distinct signature in tumour-educated monocytes might be used as a candidate biomarker in CRC diagnosis and harbours the potential for disease follow-up and therapeutic monitoring.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Parameters for vasculature (rate constant between extravascular extracellular space and blood plasma [k(ep)] and volume transfer constant [K(trans)]), extracellular space (v(e)), tumor size (the maximal axial diameter of each included lesion [MAD]), and metabolism (glucose metabolic rates [MR(glc)]) were derived, and changes during treatment were correlated. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) served as outcome measures for the predictive abilities of pretreatment parameters and of treatment-related parameter changes.Pretreatment MR(glc) and MAD were individually predictive for OS and PFS. During treatment, K(trans) increased significantly, but this increase could not be confirmed in a lesion-by-lesion analysis. MR(glc) decreased significantly (P < 0.001). No correlations were found for changes in DCE-MRI parameters and DeltaMR(glc). No relationship was found between changes in DCE-MRI parameters and OS or PFS. DeltaMR(glc) was able to predict OS (P = 0.008) after correction for confounders.The efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy assessed by reduction in tumor metabolism does not depend on pretreatment properties of the tumor vasculature determined by DCE-MRI.

Measurements from 2 commonly used SD-OCT devices are often pooled together in multiple sclerosis (MS) studies and clinical trials despite software and segmentation algorithm differences; however, individual pRNFL and GCIPL thickness measurements are not interchangeable between devices. In some circumstances, such as in the absence of a consistent OCT segmentation algorithm across platforms, a conversion equation to transform measurements between devices may be useful to facilitate pooling of data. The availability of normative data for SD-OCT measurements is limited by the lack of a large representative world-wide sample across various ages and ethnicities. Larger international studies that evaluate the effects of age, sex, and race/ethnicity on SD-OCT measurements in healthy control participants are needed to provide normative values that reflect these demographic subgroups to provide comparisons to MS retinal degeneration.Participants were part of an 11-site collaboration within the International Multiple Sclerosis Visual System (IMSVISUAL) consortium. SD-OCT was performed by a trained technician for healthy control subjects using Spectralis or Cirrus SD-OCT devices. Peripapillary pRNFL and GCIPL thicknesses were measured on one or both devices. Automated segmentation protocols, in conjunction with manual inspection and correction of lines delineating retinal layers, were used. A conversion equation was developed using structural equation modeling, accounting for clustering, with healthy control data from one site where participants were scanned on both devices on the same day. Normative values were evaluated, with the entire cohort, for pRNFL and GCIPL thicknesses for each decade of age, by sex, and across racial groups using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, accounting for clustering and adjusting for within-patient, intereye correlations. Change-point analyses were performed to determine at what age pRNFL and GCIPL thicknesses exhibit accelerated rates of decline.The healthy control cohort (n = 546) was 54% male and had a wide distribution of ages, ranging from 18 to 87 years, with a mean (SD) age of 39.3 (14.6) years. Based on 346 control participants at a single site, the conversion equation for pRNFL was Cirrus = -5.0 + (1.0 × Spectralis global value). Based on 228 controls, the equation for GCIPL was Cirrus = -4.5 + (0.9 × Spectralis global value). Standard error was 0.02 for both equations. After the age of 40 years, there was a decline of -2.4 μm per decade in pRNFL thickness ( P < 0.001, GEE models adjusting for sex, race, and country) and -1.4 μm per decade in GCIPL thickness ( P < 0.001). There was a small difference in pRNFL thickness based on sex, with female participants having slightly higher thickness (2.6 μm, P = 0.003). There was no association between GCIPL thickness and sex. Likewise, there was no association between race/ethnicity and pRNFL or GCIPL thicknesses.A conversion factor may be required when using data that are derived between different SD-OCT platforms in clinical trials and observational studies; this is particularly true for smaller cross-sectional studies or when a consistent segmentation algorithm is not available. The above conversion equations can be used when pooling data from Spectralis and Cirrus SD-OCT devices for pRNFL and GCIPL thicknesses. A faster decline in retinal thickness may occur after the age of 40 years, even in the absence of significant differences across racial groups.Copyright © 2022 by North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society.",R01 EY013178|NEI NIH HHS|United States|R01 NS082347|NINDS NIH HHS|United States,2/09/2022,D016428;D052061;D013485,10.1097/WNO.0000000000001717,NA,1,1,,

This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between serum chloride level and clinical outcomes in patients with HFpEF with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).Patient data were extracted from The Prospective mUlticenteR obServational stUdy of patIenTs with Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (PURSUIT HFpEF) study, a prospective multicentre observational registry for ADHF-HFpEF in Osaka. The data of 870 patients were analysed after excluding patients with in-hospital death, missing follow-up data, missing data of serum chloride level, or on chronic dialysis therapy. The primary endpoint of this study was all-cause mortality. At discharge, right ventricular systolic dysfunction was significantly associated with the lowest tertile of serum chloride level after multivariable adjustment (P = 0.0257). During a mean follow-up period of 1.8 ± 1.0 years, 186 patients died. Cox multivariable analysis showed that serum chloride level at discharge (P = 0.0017) was independently associated with all-cause mortality after multivariable adjustment of major confounders, whereas serum sodium level was no longer significant (P = 0.6761). Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis revealed a significantly increased risk of mortality stratified by the tertile of serum chloride level [29% vs. 19% vs. 16%, P = 0.0002; hazard ratio (HR): 2.09 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.31 to 3.34), HR: 1.03 (95% CI: 0.65 to 1.64)].Serum chloride level was useful for the prediction of poor outcome in ADHF patients with preserved ejection fraction.© 2022 The Authors.

An electrophysiological (EP) study is performed using a non-invasive programmed electrical stimulation protocol via the implanted device. All participants will undergo the EP study hence no randomisation is required. Participants will be followed up over a minimum of 18 months and up to 3 years. The first patient was recruited in August 2016 and the study will be completed at the final participant follow-up visit. The primary endpoint is ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia >200 beats/min as recorded by the ICD. The secondary endpoint is SCD. Analysis of the ECG data obtained during the EP study will be performed by the core lab where blinding of patient health status and endpoints will be maintained.Ethical approval has been granted by Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (reference no. 16/NI/0069). The results will inform the design of a definitive Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT).

In vivo near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging provides a powerful tool for identifying small nodules. The aim of this study was to examine our experience of using 2 different NIR devices in pulmonary resection surgery.From August 2015 to October 2016, 36 patients with lung nodules underwent NIR fluorescence imaging thoracoscopic surgery. Two NIR devices: a D-Light P system and a SUPEREYE system were used. Patients were administered an injection of indocyanine green (ICG) through the peripheral vein 24 h preoperatively. During surgery, traditional white-light thoracoscopic exploration was performed first, followed by ICG-fluorescent-guided exploration. All detected nodules were resected and examined by a pathologist.Of the 36 patients, 76 nodules were resected. ICG-fluorescent imaging identified 68 nodules during in vivo exploration. The mean signal-to-background ratio of lung nodules in NIR exploration was 3.29 ± 1.81. The application of NIR devices led to the detection of 9 additional nodules that were missed using traditional detection methods (1 mm computed tomography scan and white-light thoracoscopic exploration) in 7 patients (19.4%). Four of the 9 nodules were confirmed as malignant or atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (44.4%). The other 5 nodules were confirmed as false-positive nodules. The sensitivities and positive predictive values of the ICG-fluorescent imaging for lung tumours were 88.7% and 92.6%, respectively.This study demonstrated the feasibility and safety of using ICG-fluorescent imaging for multiple lung nodules identification in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery pulmonary resection.NCT02611245.© The Author 2017.

This study investigated the complication rate of transbronchial biopsies in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit and its ability to obtain a diagnosis and change current therapy.PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were systematically searched for all publications of transbronchial lung biopsies in mechanically ventilated patients. We pooled the results of individual studies using random-effects meta-analysis models to achieve the summary proportions.Of the identified 9 observational studies with a total of 232 patients undergoing a transbronchial biopsy, complications occurred in 67 patients [25.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 11.5%-42.0%; I2=70.0%]. Pneumothorax occurred in 24 patients (9.5%; 95% CI, 4.5%-16.2%; I2=15.9%) and bleeding in 18 patients (8.9%; 95% CI, 4.1%-15.3%; I2=0%). A diagnosis was given in 146 patients (62.9%; 95% CI, 56.0%-69.1%; I2=74.6%), with 103 of 210 patients (49.0%; 95% CI, 44.6%-55.1%; I2=74.9%) having a change in treatment.The results of this meta-analysis suggest that a transbronchial forceps biopsy when performed in mechanically ventilated patients with respiratory failure of unclear etiology had a moderate complication rate. These biopsies resulted in varied diagnoses with a high rate of management change. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to identify the ideal patients to perform a transbronchial forceps biopsy on in the intensive care unit.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Kaplan-Meyer and Cox regression were used to calculate the persistence rate in treatment. Disease activity at baseline and follow-up data at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of treatment were compared. Causes for discontinuing therapy were summarized using descriptive statistics. Statistical significance was assumed for 2-sided p-values <0.05.We included 1693 patients (413 on Benepali® and 1280 on Enbrel®): 864 diagnosed with RA, 335 with PsA and 494 with SpA. The 3-year persistence rates were not significantly different between both treatment groups in RA, PsA and SpA patients. In the adjusted Cox model, hazard ratios of discontinuation were not statistically different (p>0.05). The proportion of subjects in remission or low disease activity in each disease was similar in both groups. Overall, 535 (31.6%) patients discontinued etanercept (428 patients on Enbrel® and 107 patients on Benepali®). The major cause of discontinuation was inefficacy (57.8%). No differences for the occurrence of inefficacy or adverse effects were found between treatment groups.Benepali® and Enbrel® demonstrated similar effectiveness and safety in RA, PsA and SpA in our cohort of patients.

Our goal was to identify factors related to 60-day readmission. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study with a nested case-control study, with 60 days of follow-up after the index admission. Patients readmitted were matched, by age, baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s and month at admission, with patients admitted in the same period but not readmitted at 2 months. Data were collected on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and health-related quality of life data at the index admission and events from discharge to readmission within 60 days. Conditional logistic (60-day readmission) and Cox (days to readmission) regression models were constructed. Both multivariable analyses identified the following as predictors: any admission in the preceding 2 months (OR: 2.366; HR: 1.918), hematocrit at ED arrival ≤ 35% (OR: 2.949; HR: 1.570), pre-existing cardiovascular disease (valvular disease or myocardial infarction) (OR: 1.878; HR: 1.490); NIMV at discharge (OR: 0.547; HR: 0.70); no appointment with a specialist after discharge (OR: 5.785; HR: 3.373) and patient-reported need for help at home (OR: 2.978; HR: 2.061). The AUC for the logistic model was 0.845 and the c-index for the Cox model was 0.707. EuroQol EQ-5D score before the admission was correlated with a lower risk of readmission (OR: 0.383; HR: 0.670). As conclusions, we have identified factors related to 60-day readmission and summarized the findings in easy-to-use scoring scales that could be incorporated into the daily clinical routine and may help establish preventive measures to reduce future readmissions.Registration: Clinical Trial Registration NCT03227211.© 2022.

We aimed to determine predictors of adherence to CPAP among participants of the Sleep Apnea and cardioVascular Endpoints (SAVE) trial.SAVE was an international, randomized, open trial of CPAP plus usual care versus usual care (UC) alone in participants (45-75 years) with co-occurring moderate-to-severe OSA (≥12 episodes/h of ≥4% oxygen desaturation) and established cardiovascular (CV) disease. Baseline sociodemographic, health and lifestyle factors, OSA symptoms, and 1-month change in daytime sleepiness, as well as CPAP side effects and adherence (during sham screening, titration week, and in the first month), were entered in univariate linear regression analyses to identify predictors of CPAP adherence at 24 months. Variables with p <0.2 were assessed for inclusion in a multivariate linear mixed model with country, age, and sex included a priori and site as a random effect.Significant univariate predictors of adherence at 24 months in 1,121 participants included: early adherence measures, improvement in daytime sleepiness at 1 month, fixed CPAP pressure, some measures of OSA severity, cardiovascular disease history, breathing pauses, and very loud snoring. While observed adherence varied between countries, adherence during sham screening, initial titration, and the first month of treatment retained independent predictive value in the multivariate model along with fixed CPAP pressure and very loud snoring.Early CPAP adherence had the greatest predictive value for identifying those at highest risk of non-adherence to long-term CPAP therapy.SAVE is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00738179).© Sleep Research Society 2019.

EGFR mutations are relatively common in Asian patients with NSCLC, and there is an increasing number of studies supporting the effectiveness of the second-generation TKI afatinib in routine clinical practice in Asia. This article reviews these real-world studies investigating afatinib as first-line treatment for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in Asian patients. Evidence from real-world studies with afatinib in this patient population supports findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing that afatinib is associated with more favorable outcomes compared with the first-generation EGFR TKIs. The effectiveness of afatinib has also been shown in real-world studies in Asian patients with poor prognostic factors, who are often under-represented or excluded from RCTs, such as those with uncommon EGFR mutations, brain metastases, or poor performance status, and elderly patients. The tolerability profile of afatinib in the real-world setting reflects that seen in RCTs, with no new safety signals reported in real-world studies in Asian patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Dose-modification strategies also seem to be effective in the real world, with results of the RealGido study, which included 44% Asian patients, confirming findings from prospective clinical trials showing that tolerability-guided afatinib dose modifications can reduce the incidence of adverse events without adversely affecting clinical outcomes. While further research, including clinical trial data, is needed, real-world data have also demonstrated the feasibility of sequential afatinib followed by the third-generation TKI osimertinib in T790M-positive EGFR mutation-positive patients, which showed longer overall survival. Together, these real-world results demonstrate the real-world clinical effectiveness of afatinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.",NA,18/03/2021,D016428;D016454,10.1007/s12325-021-01696-9,NA,1,1,,

Concerns were raised about the potential for delayed and more severe presentations and an increase in diagnoses such as diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health issues. This multinational observational study aimed to study the number of children presenting to EDs across Europe during the early COVID-19 pandemic and factors influencing this and to investigate changes in severity of illness and diagnoses.Routine health data were extracted retrospectively from electronic patient records of children aged 18 years and under, presenting to 38 EDs in 16 European countries for the period January 2018 to May 2020, using predefined and standardized data domains. Observed and predicted numbers of ED attendances were calculated for the period February 2020 to May 2020. Poisson models and incidence rate ratios (IRRs), using predicted counts for each site as offset to adjust for case-mix differences, were used to compare age groups, diagnoses, and outcomes. Reductions in pediatric ED attendances, hospital admissions, and high triage urgencies were seen in all participating sites. ED attendances were relatively higher in countries with lower SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (IRR 2.26, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.70, p < 0.001) and in children aged <12 months (12 to <24 months IRR 0.86, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.89; 2 to <5 years IRR 0.80, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.82; 5 to <12 years IRR 0.68, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.70; 12 to 18 years IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.74; versus age <12 months as reference group, p < 0.001). The lowering of pediatric intensive care admissions was not as great as that of general admissions (IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.45, p < 0.001). Lower triage urgencies were reduced more than higher triage urgencies (urgent triage IRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.12; emergent and very urgent triage IRR 1.53, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.57; versus nonurgent triage category, p < 0.001). Reductions were highest and sustained throughout the study period for children with communicable infectious diseases.

The secondary aim was to develop and validate radiomics models for differentiating low-risk endometrial cancer from other endometrial cancers.This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study. From two participating centers, we identified consecutive patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometrial cancer who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination by an experienced examiner between 2016 and 2019. Patients recruited in Center 1 (Rome) were included as the training set and patients enrolled in Center 2 (Milan) formed the external validation set. Radiomics analysis (extraction of a high number of quantitative features from medical images) was applied to the ultrasound images. Clinical (including preoperative biopsy), ultrasound and radiomics features that were statistically significantly different in the high-risk group vs the other groups and in the low-risk group vs the other groups on univariate analysis in the training set were considered for multivariate analysis and for developing ultrasound-based machine-learning risk-prediction models. For discriminating between the high-risk group and the other groups, a random forest model from the radiomics features (radiomics model), a binary logistic regression model from clinical and ultrasound features (clinical-ultrasound model) and another binary logistic regression model from clinical, ultrasound and previously selected radiomics features (mixed model) were created. Similar models were created for discriminating between the low-risk group and the other groups. The models developed in the training set were tested in the validation set. The performance of the models in discriminating between the high-risk group and the other groups, and between the low-risk group and the other risk groups for both validation and training sets was compared.The training set comprised 396 patients and the validation set 102 patients. In the validation set, for predicting high-risk endometrial cancer, the radiomics model had an area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.80, sensitivity of 58.7% and specificity of 85.7% (using the optimal risk cut-off of 0.41); the clinical-ultrasound model had an AUC of 0.90, sensitivity of 80.4% and specificity of 83.9% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.32); and the mixed model had an AUC of 0.88, sensitivity of 67.3% and specificity of 91.0% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.42). For the prediction of low-risk endometrial cancer, the radiomics model had an AUC of 0.71, sensitivity of 65.0% and specificity of 64.5% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.38); the clinical-ultrasound model had an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 70.0% and specificity of 80.6% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.46); and the mixed model had an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 72.5% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.36).Radiomics seems to have some ability to discriminate between low-risk endometrial cancer and other endometrial cancers and better ability to discriminate between high-risk endometrial cancer and other endometrial cancers. However, the addition of radiomics features to the clinical-ultrasound models did not result in any notable increase in performance. Other efficacy studies and further effectiveness studies are needed to validate the performance of the models. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.© 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.",NA,30/10/2021,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1002/uog.24805,NA,1,1,,

The outcomes of interest were in-hospital pulmonary embolism or lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (PE-LDVT), in-hospital nonleg deep vein thrombosis (NLDVT), and 90-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between predefined baseline prognostic factors and PE-LDVT or NLDVT.

We sought to compare rates of invasive mediastinal staging for lung cancer across hospitals participating in a regional quality improvement and research collaborative.We conducted a retrospective study (2011-2013) of patients undergoing resected lung cancer from the Surgical Clinical Outcomes and Assessment Program in Washington State. Invasive mediastinal staging included mediastinoscopy and/or endobronchial/esophageal ultrasound-guided nodal aspiration. We used a mixed-effects model to mitigate the influence of small sample sizes at any 1 hospital on rates of invasive staging and to adjust for hospital-level differences in the frequency of clinical stage IA disease.A total of 406 patients (mean age, 68 years; 69% clinical stage IA; and 67% lobectomy) underwent resection at 5 hospitals (4 community and 1 academic). Invasive staging occurred in 66% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 61%-71%). CI inspection revealed that 2 hospitals performed invasive staging significantly more often than the overall average (94%, [95% CI, 89%-96%] and 84% [95% CI, 78%-88%]), whereas 2 hospitals performed invasive staging significantly less often than overall average (31% [95% CI, 21%-44%] and 17% [95% CI, 7%-36%]).Rates of invasive mediastinal staging varied significantly across hospitals providing surgical care for patients with lung cancer.

In a randomized trial of FFT compared to a psychoeducation-only treatment (enhanced care, EC), we sought to determine if changes in psychosocial functioning mediate mood improvements among high-risk youth.119 youths with active mood symptoms and a family history of BD were randomized to either 4 months of FFT or EC. Participants were rated on mood symptom severity and provided self-ratings of psychosocial functioning across domains of family, social-emotional, and school functioning. Repeated measures mixed modeling and bootstrapped mediational analyses evaluated the effects of treatment conditions and psychosocial functioning on mood improvements immediately posttreatment and over 2 years of follow-up.Youths in FFT reported greater improvements in family functioning over 24 months compared to those in EC, F(5, 76.8) = 3.1, p < .05. Improvements in family functioning partially mediated participants' improvements in depressive symptoms, B = -0.22, p < .01; 95% CI [-0.55, -0.02]. The effects of FFT versus EC on family functioning were stronger among youth with comorbid anxiety and externalizing disorders than among youth without these comorbid disorders.The findings suggest a temporal link between changes in youths' perceptions of family functioning and improvements in depressive symptoms among high-risk youth in FFT. Family conflict and cohesion are important treatment targets for youth who present with early signs of BD. Future studies should examine whether changes in observational measures of family interaction precede improvements in mood among high-risk youth.

However, to our knowledge, the durability of these prostheses is incompletely defined.To determine the midterm hemodynamic performance of balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valves.In this study, we analyzed core laboratory-generated data from echocardiograms of all patients enrolled in the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) 1 Trial with successful TAVR or surgical AVR (SAVR) obtained preimplantation and at 7 days, 1 and 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years postimplantation. Patients from continued access observational studies were included for comparison.Successful implantation after randomization to TAVR vs SAVR (PARTNER 1A; TAVR, n = 321; SAVR, n = 313), TAVR vs medical treatment (PARTNER 1B; TAVR, n = 165), and continued access (TAVR, n = 1996). Five-year echocardiogram data were available for 424 patients after TAVR and 49 after SAVR.Death or reintervention for aortic valve structural indications, measured using aortic valve mean gradient, effective orifice area, Doppler velocity index, and evidence of hemodynamic deterioration by reintervention, adverse hemodynamics, or transvalvular regurgitation.Of 2795 included patients, the mean (SD) age was 84.5 (7.1) years, and 1313 (47.0%) were female. Population hemodynamic trends derived from nonlinear mixed-effects models showed small early favorable changes in the first few months post-TAVR, with a decrease of -2.9 mm Hg in aortic valve mean gradient, an increase of 0.028 in Doppler velocity index, and an increase of 0.09 cm2 in effective orifice area. There was relative stability at a median follow-up of 3.1 (maximum, 5) years. Moderate/severe transvalvular regurgitation was noted in 89 patients (3.7%) after TAVR and increased over time. Patients with SAVR showed no significant changes. In TAVR, death/reintervention was associated with lower ejection fraction, stroke volume index, and aortic valve mean gradient up to 3 years, with no association with Doppler velocity index or valve area. Reintervention occurred in 20 patients (0.8%) after TAVR and in 1 (0.3%) after SAVR and became less frequent over time. Reintervention was caused by structural deterioration of transcatheter heart valves in only 5 patients. Severely abnormal hemodynamics on echocardiograms were also infrequent and not associated with excess death or reintervention for either TAVR or SAVR.This large, core laboratory-based study of transcatheter heart valves revealed excellent durability of the transcatheter heart valves and SAVR.

Technical advances are therefore desirable for the improvement of the adenoma detection rate (ADR). An automated computer-driven technology would offer the chance to objectively assess the presence of colorectal polyps during colonoscopy. We present here the application of a real-time automated polyp detection software (APDS) under routine colonoscopy conditions.This was a prospective study at a university hospital in Germany. A prototype of a novel APDS (""KoloPol,"" Fraunhofer IIS, Erlangen, Germany) was used for automated image-based polyp detection. The software functions by highlighting structures of possible polyp lesions in a color-coded manner during real-time colonoscopy procedures. Testing the feasibility of APDS deployment under real-time conditions was the primary goal of the study. APDS polyp detection rates (PDRs) were defined as secondary endpoints provided that endoscopists' detection served as criterion standard.The APDS was applied in 55 routine colonoscopies without the occurrence of any clinically relevant adverse events. Endoscopists' PDRs and ADRs were 56.4% and 30.9%, respectively. The PDRs and ADRs of the APDS were 50.9% and 29.1%, respectively. The APDS detected 55 of 73 polyps (75.3%). Smaller polyp size and flat polyp morphology were correlated with insufficient polyp detection by the APDS.Computer-assisted automated low-delay polyp detection is feasible during real-time colonoscopy. Efforts should be undertaken to improve the APDS with respect to smaller and flat shaped polyps.

Plasma HGF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the first 24 h after admission (day 1) and on day 3. The primary endpoint was defined as all-cause 28-day mortality. Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation of HGF with relevant endothelial cell injury markers.Eighty-six patients admitted with sepsis were included. HGF levels of nonsurvivors were elevated compared to those of survivors on day 1 (1940.62 ± 74.66 pg/mL vs. 1635.61 ± 47.49 pg/mL; P = 0.002) and day 3 (1824.82 ± 137.52 pg/mL vs. 1309.77 ± 83.49 pg/mL; P = 0.001) and showed a strong correlation with von Willebrand factor (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001), lactate (r = 0.35, P = 0.0011), pulmonary vascular permeability index (r = 0.38, P = 0.0241), first 24 h fluid administration (r = 0.38, P < 0.0001), and sequential organ failure assessment score (r = 0.40, P = 0.0001). Plasma HGF levels were able to prognostically discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors on day 1 (AUC: 0.72, 95%CI: 0.60-0.84) and day 3 (AUC: 0.77, 95%CI: 0.63-0.91).HGF levels are associated with sepsis and correlated with established markers of endothelial cell injury. Elevated HGF levels in sepsis patients are an efficient indicator of poor prognosis.The study was registered in Clinical Trial (Registration Number: NCT02883231).",NA,23/02/2021,D016428;D064888,10.1177/0885066621993423,NCT02883231,1,1,,

Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis improve outcomes. However, although professional critical care societies have proposed new clinical criteria that aid sepsis recognition, the fundamental need for early detection and treatment remains unmet. In response, researchers have proposed algorithms for early sepsis detection, but directly comparing such methods has not been possible because of different patient cohorts, clinical variables and sepsis criteria, prediction tasks, evaluation metrics, and other differences. To address these issues, the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 facilitated the development of automated, open-source algorithms for the early detection of sepsis from clinical data.Participants submitted containerized algorithms to a cloud-based testing environment, where we graded entries for their binary classification performance using a novel clinical utility-based evaluation metric. We designed this scoring function specifically for the Challenge to reward algorithms for early predictions and penalize them for late or missed predictions and for false alarms.ICUs in three separate hospital systems.

The clinical implication of contralateral suppression (CS; aldosterone/cortisolnondominant<aldosterone/cortisolperipheral) at AVS remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of CS and its impact on postoperative outcomes after unilateral adrenalectomy.In this retrospective observational multi-center study, we analyzed PA patients who underwent both successful adrenocorticotropin hormone-stimulated AVS and unilateral adrenalectomy. Successful cannulation was defined as the selectivity index (cortisoladrenal/cortisolperipheral) ≥3. Clinical and biochemical outcomes after unilateral adrenalectomy were evaluated based on the international Primary Aldosteronism Surgical Outcome consensus.Among 263 patients analyzed, 247 had CS (93.9%). Patients with CS had lower serum potassium levels, higher plasma aldosterone concentration, higher aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), and larger adenoma size than those without CS. Those with CS showed significantly higher lateralization index than those without CS (P<0.001). Although postoperative blood pressure and ARR significantly decreased in those with CS, clinical and biochemical outcomes were comparable in both groups. When the cut-off value of age was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, patients aged ≥50 years old with contralateral suppression index (CSI; the ratio between aldosterone/cortisolnondominant and aldosterone/cortisolperipheral) ≤0.26 had greater odds ratio (6.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 31.69) of incident chronic kidney disease than those aged <50 years with CSI >0.26 after adjusting for other factors.CS may not predict postoperative clinical and biochemical outcomes in subjects with unilateral aldosterone excess, but it is associated with postsurgical deterioration of renal function in subjects over 50 years with CSI ≤0.26.",U38 IP000862|NCIRD CDC HHS|United States,12/08/2021,D016428;D016448;D064888;D013485,10.3803/EnM.2021.1047,NA,1,1,,

A novel task-specific exercise modality, gait adaptability training (GAT), has shown promising preventive effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesise the evidence regarding GATs effect on falls and fall-related fractures in community-dwelling older adults.electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL) were systematically searched from inception to 18 June 2020. Additional sources include searches of trial registrations, manual screening of reference lists and requests to experts. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of GAT on falls with at least 6-month follow-up among community-dwelling people aged 60+ years. Two reviewers independently screened studies against eligibility criteria, extracted relevant information and appraised studies for bias. Random-effects meta-analytic models were employed to pool effect estimates.eleven studies with 1,131 participants were included. A meta-analysis in which an outlier study was excluded showed that GAT reduces fall rates by 42% (incidence rate ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.81, I2 = 0.00%; moderate certainty; seven RCTs). Moreover, proportion with fall-related fractures and proportion of fallers was reduced by 81% (risk ratio [RR] 0.19, 95% CI 0.06-0.56, I2 = 0.00%; very low certainty; two RCTs) and 43% (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.4-to 0.8, I2 = 47.08%; low certainty; 11 RCTs), respectively.our results show that GAT significantly reduces the number of falls and prevents fall-related fractures in older community dwellers. GAT is a promising and feasible exercise modality; however, studies of high quality should be conducted to support a robust conclusion.PROSPERO; CRD42020191051.© The Author(s) 2021.

Here, we report a workflow for the segmentation of anatomical structures and the annotation of pathological features in slit-lamp images, and the use of the workflow to improve the performance of a deep-learning algorithm for diagnosing ophthalmic disorders.

However, little is known regarding clinical and radiological outcomes among this singularly underexplored subpopulation undergoing failed MT. We aimed to investigate the outcome after failed MT and identify predictive factors of favorable outcome despite recanalization failure.We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients prospectively included in the ongoing observational multicenter Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke registry from January 2015 to September 2020. Patients presenting with anterior circulation LVOS treated with MT but experiencing failed intracranial recanalization defined as final modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) score of 0, 1 and 2a were included.

The value of using posturography for evaluating the risk of falling is unclear. In theory, a time-scale analysis should increase the metrological properties of the posturography assessment.This study aimed to determine which posturographic parameters can be used to identify fall-risk patients in a frail diabetic older population and to assess their interest in comparison to usual clinical trials for gait and balance.This is a prospective observational cohort.frail or pre-frail diabetic patients, in Bordeaux, France.84 patients were included in the study (mean age 80.09 years, 64.5% of men).Criteria for inclusion were: age over 70 years, diabetes mellitus for over 2 years, and at least one of the Fried's frailty criteria.Gait and balance assessments were undertaken at baseline: Static posturography, the timed up and go test, short physical performance battery, and (gait) walking speed. Raw data from posturography were used for wavelet analysis. Data on self reported new falls were collected prospectively during 6 months.The posturography parameter most useful was area of 90% confidence ellipse of statokinesigram (COP90area): area under the ROC curve AUC = 0.617 (95% CI, 0.445-0.789) and OR=1.003 (95%CI 1.000-1.005) p =0.05.

Our previous work showed that variation measures, which represent breast architecture derived from mammograms, were significantly associated with breast cancer. For replication purposes, we examined the association of three variation measures (variation [V], which is measured in the image domain, and P1 and p1 [a normalized version of P1], which are derived from restricted regions in the Fourier domain) with breast cancer risk in an independent population. We also compared these measures to volumetric density measures (volumetric percent density [VPD] and dense volume [DV]) from a commercial product. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We examined 514 patients with breast cancer and 1377 control patients from a screening practice who were matched for age, date of examination, mammography unit, facility, and state of residence. Spearman rank-order correlation was used to evaluate the monotonic association between measures. Breast cancer associations were estimated using conditional logistic regression, after adjustment for age and body mass index. Odds ratios were calculated per SD increment in mammographic measure. RESULTS. These variation measures were strongly correlated with VPD (correlation, 0.68-0.80) but not with DV (correlation, 0.31-0.48). Similar to previous findings, all variation measures were significantly associated with breast cancer (odds ratio per SD: 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16-1.46] for V, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.35-1.77] for P1, and 1.51 [95% CI, 1.33-1.72] for p1). Associations of volumetric density measures with breast cancer were similar (odds ratio per SD: 1.54 [95% CI, 1.33-1.78] for VPD and 1.34 [95% CI, 1.20-1.50] for DV). When DV was included with each variation measure in the same model, all measures retained significance. CONCLUSION. Variation measures were significantly associated with breast cancer risk (comparable to the volumetric density measures) but were independent of the DV.",P01 CA154292|NCI NIH HHS|United States|R01 CA166269|NCI NIH HHS|United States|R01 CA177150|NCI NIH HHS|United States|U01 CA200464|NCI NIH HHS|United States,24/06/2021,D016428;D052061,10.2214/AJR.20.22794,NA,1,1,,

Our aim was to develop a capnography-based, point-of-care tool that can estimate the level of obstruction in patients with asthma and COPD.Two prospective observational studies conducted between September 2016 and May 2018 at Rabin Medical Center, Israel, included healthy, asthma and COPD patient groups. Each patient underwent spirometry test and continuous capnography, as part of, either methacholine challenge test for asthma diagnosis or bronchodilator reversibility test for asthma and COPD routine evaluation. Continuous capnography signal, divided into single breaths waveforms, were analyzed to identify waveform features, to create a predictive model for FEV1 using an artificial neural network. The gold standard for comparison was FEV1 measured with spirometry.Overall 160 patients analyzed. Model prediction included 32/88 waveform features and three demographic features (age, gender and height). The model showed excellent correlation with FEV1 (R = 0.84), R2 achieved was 0.7 with mean square error of 0.13.In this study we have developed a model to evaluate FEV1 in asthma and COPD patients. Using this model, as a point-of-care tool, we can evaluate the airway obstruction level without reliance on patient cooperation.

Patients were regularly followed up at the end of 28-d, 90-d and 365-d, or until death or liver transplantation (LT). The primary outcome in this study was 90-d LT-free mortality. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) was assessed on admission and during 28-d hospitalization, according to the diagnostic criteria of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). Risk factors for death were analyzed with logistic regression model.In patients with cirrhosis and AD, the overall prevalence of AILD was 9.3% (242/2597). Prevalence of ACLF was significantly lower in AILD cases (14%) than those with all etiology groups with cirrhosis and AD (22.8%) (P < 0.001). Among 242 enrolled AILD patients, the prevalence rates of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and PBC-AIH overlap syndrome (PBC/AIH) were 50.8%, 28.5% and 12.0%, respectively. In ACLF patients, the proportions of PBC, AIH and PBC/AIH were 41.2%, 29.4% and 20.6%. 28-d and 90-d mortality were 43.8% and 80.0% in AILD-related ACLF. The etiology of AILD had no significant impact on 28-d, 90-d or 365-d LT-free mortality in patients with cirrhosis and AD in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Total bilirubin (TB), hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were independent risk factors for 90-d LT-free mortality in multivariate analysis. The development of ACLF during hospitalization only independently correlated to TB and international normalized ratio.AILD was not rare in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and AD in China, among which PBC was the most common etiology. 90-d LT-free mortality were independently associated with TB, HE and BUN.©The Author(s) 2022.

The primary outcome measure was a score <10 on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The secondary outcome, self-reported functional limitation, was assessed by written questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to assess associations of both outcomes with demographic and clinical factors (glycemic and nonglycemic factors, micro- and macrovascular complications, DCCT cohort, and treatment assignment).Participants were 53% male, with mean ± SD age 59.5 ± 6.8 years and diabetes duration 37.9 ± 4.9 years. The prevalence of SPPB score <10 was 21%. The prevalence of self-reported functional limitations was 48%. While DCCT treatment assignment was not associated with physical function outcomes measured ∼25 years after the end of the DCCT, the time-weighted mean DCCT/EDIC HbA1c was associated with both outcomes. Other clinical factors associated with both outcomes in multivariable analyses were BMI, general psychological distress, and cardiac autonomic neuropathy.Almost half of the middle-aged and older adults with long-standing type 1 diabetes reported functional limitations, which were associated with higher HbA1c and BMI, general psychological distress, and cardiac autonomic neuropathy.

Unpublished data on major bleeding events and person-years were obtained from authors of included studies to calculate study-level incidence rates. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool results across studies. Of 1,123 records identified by the search, 20 studies (17 RCTs) and 8,740 patients were included in the analysis. During 13,011 person-years of follow-up after discontinuing anticoagulation, the pooled incidence of major bleeding (n = 41) and fatal bleeding (n = 7) per 100 person-years was 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-0.54) and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.05-0.15). The 5-year cumulative incidence of major bleeding was of 1.0% (95% CI: 0.4-2.4%). The case-fatality rate of major bleeding after discontinuing anticoagulation was 19.9% (95% CI: 10.6-31.1%). The risk of major bleeding once anticoagulants are discontinued in patients with a first unprovoked VTE is not zero. Estimates from this study can help clinicians counsel patients about the incremental risk of major bleeding with extended anticoagulation to guide decision making about treatment duration for unprovoked VTE.Thieme.

We examined the implications of using IG-NS at birth and WHO-GS at postnatal ages in longitudinal epidemiologic studies.The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which standardised measures of newborn size and growth are affected when using WHO-GS versus IG-NS at birth among term-born infants.Data from two prenatal trials in Bangladesh (n = 755) and The Gambia (n = 522) were used to estimate and compare size at birth and growth from birth to 3 months when using WHO-GS only ('WHO-GS') versus IG-NS at birth and WHO-GS postnatally ('IG-NS'). Mean length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ) and head circumference-for-age (HCAZ), and the prevalence of undernutrition (stunting: LAZ < -2SD; underweight: WAZ < -2SD; and microcephaly: HCAZ < -2SD) were estimated overall and by GA strata [early-term (370/7 -386/7 ), full-term (390/7 -406/7 ) and late-term (410/7 -430/7 )]. We used Bland-Altman plots to compare continuous indices and Kappa statistic to compare categorical indicators.At birth, mean LAZ, WAZ and HCAZ, and the prevalence of undernutrition were most similar among newborns between 39 and 40 weeks of GA when using WHO-GS versus IG-NS. However, anthropometric indices were systematically lower among early-term infants and higher among late-term infants when using WHO-GS versus IG-NS. Early-term and late-term infants demonstrated relatively faster and slower growth, respectively, when using WHO-GS versus IG-NS, with the direction and magnitude of differences varying between anthropometric indices. Individual-level differences in attained size and growth, when using WHO-GS versus IG-NS, were greater than 0.2 SD in magnitude for >60% of infants across all anthropometric indices.Using IG-NS at birth with WHO-GS postnatally is acceptable for full-term infants but may give a misleading interpretation of growth trajectories among early- and late-term infants.© 2022 The Authors.

Report from the IFCN-sponsored panel of experts.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease among the elderly with a progressive decline in cognitive function significantly affecting quality of life. Both the prevalence and emotional and financial burdens of AD on patients, their families, and society are predicted to grow significantly in the near future, due to a prolongation of the lifespan. Several lines of evidence suggest that modifications of risk-enhancing life styles and initiation of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in the early stage of disease, although not able to modify its course, helps to maintain personal autonomy in daily activities and significantly reduces the total costs of disease management. Moreover, many clinical trials with potentially disease-modifying drugs are devoted to prodromal stages of AD. Thus, the identification of markers of conversion from prodromal form to clinically AD may be crucial for developing strategies of early interventions. The current available markers, including volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis are expensive, poorly available in community health facilities, and relatively invasive. Taking into account its low cost, widespread availability and non-invasiveness, electroencephalography (EEG) would represent a candidate for tracking the prodromal phases of cognitive decline in routine clinical settings eventually in combination with other markers. In this scenario, the present paper provides an overview of epidemiology, genetic risk factors, neuropsychological, fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers in AD and describes the potential role of EEG in AD investigation, trying in particular to point out whether advanced analysis of EEG rhythms exploring brain function has sufficient specificity/sensitivity/accuracy for the early diagnosis of AD.Copyright © 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In this article, we will objectively review the evolution of the ischemia paradigm, the trial evidence comparing revascularization to medical therapy in SIHD, and what contemporary practice should be in 2022.Randomized trials, including COURAGE and, most recently, the ISCHEMIA trial, have shown no reduction in ""hard outcomes"" like death and myocardial infarction (MI) in SIHD compared to medical therapy. The trial excluded high-risk patients with left main disease, low ejection fraction (EF) < 35%, and severe unacceptable angina. Irrespective of the severity of ischemia and the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), revascularization did not offer any prognostic advantage over medical therapy. On the other hand, there was a durable improvement in symptoms. While there are many caveats to the ISCHEMIA trial, the overall strengths of the trial outweigh these limitations. The findings of ISCHEMIA are consistent with previous trials. It is time for the cardiology community to pivot towards medical therapy as the initial step for most patients with SIHD. Physicians should have the ""COURAGE"" to embrace ""ISCHEMIA"" and be comfortable with treating ischemia medically.© 2022.

During a mean follow-up period of 68 ± 34 months, we documented 16 arrhythmias presumably responsible for syncope (5 VAs, 10 bradycardias, and 1 supraventricular tachycardia). Additionally, recurrent syncope not associated with electrocardiogram documentation occurred in 16 patients (11.2%). The cause of syncope was identified in 23 of 97 patients with a monitoring device (23.8%). The 5-year incidence of VAs and arrhythmic events presumably responsible for syncope was 4.9% and 11.0%, respectively. Patients who developed VAs showed no prodromes or specific triggers at the time of syncope. Neither the presence of a family history of sudden cardiac death nor the previously reported high-risk electrocardiographic parameters differed between patients with and without VAs.VAs occurred in 4.9% of patients with an ER pattern and syncope. Device implantation based on detailed history taking seems to be a reasonable strategy. Previously reported high-risk electrocardiographic patterns did not identify patients with VAs.Copyright © 2022 Heart Rhythm Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This review assessed the evidence that endoscopic surveillance may prolong life by allowing earlier detection of CRC or its pre-cursor lesion, dysplasia, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).To assess the effectiveness of cancer surveillance programs for diagnosis of IBD-associated colorectal cancer and in reducing the mortality rate from colorectal cancer in patients with IBD.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and clinical clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 19 September 2016. We also searched conference abstracts and reference lists to identify additional studies.Potentially relevant articles were reviewed independently and unblinded by two authors to determine eligibility. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies (cohort or case control) assessing any form of endoscopic surveillance aimed at early detection of CRC were considered for inclusion. Studies had to have a no surveillance comparison group to be eligible for inclusion.Eligible studies were reviewed in duplicate and the results of the primary research trials were independently extracted by two authors. The primary outcome was detection of CRC. Secondary outcomes included death from CRC, time to cancer detection, time to death and adverse events. Deaths from CRC were derived from life tables, survival curves or where possible, by calculating life tables from the data provided. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was tested by the chi-square test. Because this is a relatively insensitive test, a P value of less than 0.1 was considered statistically significant. Provided statistical heterogeneity was not present, the fixed effects model was used for the pooling of data. The 2x2 tables were combined into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals as described by Cochrane and Mantel and Haenszel. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for non-randomised studies The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and selected secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria.No RCTs were identified. Five observational studies (N = 7199) met the inclusion criteria. The studies scored well on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, but due to the nature of observational studies, a high risk of bias was assigned to all the studies. Three studies were pooled to assess the rate of cancer detected in the surveillance group compared to the non-surveillance group. The studies found a significantly higher rate of cancer detection in the non surveillance group compared to the surveillance group. CRC was detected in 1.83% (53/2895) of patients in the surveillance group compared to 3.17% (135/4256) of patients in the non-surveillance group (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.80; P = 0.0009). Four studies were pooled to assess the death rate associated with CRC in patients who underwent surveillance compared to patients who did not undergo surveillance. There was a significantly lower death rate associated with CRC in the surveillance group compared to the non-surveillance group. Eight per cent (15/176) of patients in the surveillance group died from CRC compared to 22% (79/354) of patients in the non-surveillance group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69, P=0.002). Data were pooled from two studies to examine the rate of early stage versus late stage colorectal cancer (Duke stages A & B compared to Duke stages C & D) in patients who underwent surveillance compared to patients who do not undergo surveillance. A significantly higher rate of early stage CRC (Duke A & B) was detected in the surveillance group compared to the non-surveillance group. Sixteen per cent (17/110) of patients in the surveillance group had early stage CRC compared to 8% (9/117) of patients in the non-surveillance group (OR 5.40, 95% CI 1.51 to 19.30; P = 0.009). A higher rate of late stage CRC (Duke C & D) was observed in the non-surveillance group compared to the surveillance group. Nine per cent (10/110) of patients in the surveillance group had late stage CRC compared to 16% (19/117) of patients in the non-surveillance group (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.51; P = 0.37). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of the data was very low for all of these outcomes. The included studies did not report on the other pre-specified outcomes including time to cancer detection, time to death and adverse events.The current data suggest that colonoscopic surveillance in IBD may reduce the development of both CRC and the rate of CRC-associated death through early detection, although the quality of the evidence is very low. The detection of earlier stage CRC in the surveillance group may explain some of the survival benefit observed. RCTs assessing the efficacy of endoscopic surveillance in people with IBD are unlikely to be undertaken due to ethical considerations.",NA,19/09/2017,D016428;D052061;D013485;D016454;D000078182,10.1002/14651858.CD000279.pub4,NA,0,0,,

The recency effect depends on short-term memory (STM) and the primacy effect on long-term memory (LTM), where verbal information is transferred from STM into LTM by maintenance rehearsal. We compared the serial position effects (SPE) between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Parkinson's disease (PD), i.e., PD-MCI, and patients with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (AD-MCI), and evaluated the influence of SPE and frontostriatal deficits on verbal memory recall.Four similar groups of subjects participated in the study: 26 PD-MCI patients, 26 cognitively normal patients with PD (PD-CN), 26 AD-MCI patients, and 26 normal controls (NC). Verbal episodic memory, verbal span, attentional capacity, executive functions, and verbal working memory performance were assessed. Measures for primacy and recency regions were defined at the first trial of a 16-items word list. Hierarchical regression models were used to investigate the contribution of frontostriatal deficits beyond SPE on verbal memory recall performance (""long-delay free recall"") in PD and AD patients.Primacy effects were significantly diminished in both PD-MCI and AD-MCI patients relative to NC and PD-CN (all p < 0.01). Compared to PD-MCI patients, AD-MCI patients exhibited significantly worse ""delayed-recall 'savings'."" Reduced primacy effect was predictive for decreased recall performance in PD and AD. The conducted hierarchical regression model revealed that in PD, but not in AD patients, performance of attention and executive function significantly increased the prediction of free recalled words.Reduced recall performance is likely due to impaired transition of newly learned material from STM into LTM in AD and in PD. Whereas AD-MCI patients suffer from a storage deficit, the similarly reduced recall performance found in patients with PD-MCI may additionally be related to deficient attentional and executive capacity.© 2020 S.

The use of AI enabled quantitative CCTA (AI-QCT) analysis software enhances our diagnostic and prognostic ability, however, it is currently unclear whether software performance is influenced by CCTA scanning parameters.CCTA and quantitative coronary CT (QCT) data from 303 stable patients (64 ± 10 years, 71% male) from the derivation arm of the CREDENCE Trial were retrospectively analyzed using an FDA-cleared cloud-based software that performs AI-enabled coronary segmentation, lumen and vessel wall determination, plaque quantification and characterization, and stenosis determination. The algorithm's diagnostic performance measures (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) for detecting coronary lesions of ≥50% stenosis were determined based on concordance with QCA measurements and subsequently compared across scanning parameters (including scanner vendor, model, single vs dual source, tube voltage, dose length product, gating technique, timing method), scan preparation technique (use of beta blocker, use and dose of nitroglycerin), contrast administration parameters (contrast type, infusion rate, iodine concentration, contrast volume) and patient parameters (heart rate and BMI).Within the patient cohort, 13% demonstrated ≥50% stenosis in 3 vessel territories, 21% in 2 vessel territories, 35% in 1 vessel territory while 32% had <50% stenosis in all vessel territories evaluated by QCA. Average AI analysis time was 10.3 ± 2.7 min. On a per vessel basis, there were significant differences only in sensitivity for ≥50% stenosis based on contrast type (iso-osmolar 70.0% vs non isoosmolar 92.1% p = 0.0345) and iodine concentration (<350 mg/ml 70.0%, 350-369 mg/ml 90.0%, 370-400 mg/ml 90.0%, >400 mg/ml 95.2%; p = 0.0287) in the context of low injection flow rates. On a per patient basis there were no significant differences in AI diagnostic performance measures across all measured scanner, scan technique, patient preparation, contrast, and individual patient parameters.The diagnostic performance of AI-QCT analysis software for detecting moderate to high grade stenosis are unaffected by commonly used CCTA scanning parameters and across a range of common scanning, scanner, contrast and patient variables.An AI-enabled quantitative CCTA (AI-QCT) analysis software has been validated as an effective tool for the identification, quantification and characterization of coronary plaque and stenosis through comparison to blinded expert readers and quantitative coronary angiography. However, it is unclear whether CCTA screening parameters related to scanner parameters, scan technique, contrast volume and rate, radiation dose, or a patient's BMI or heart rate at time of scan affect the software's diagnostic measures for detection of moderate to high grade stenosis. AI performance measures were unaffected across a broad range of commonly encountered scanner, patient preparation, scan technique, intravenous contrast and patient parameters.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

This study aimed to determine whether levetiracetam combined with valproic acid (LEV + VPA), a commonly prescribed duotherapy, is more effective than other duotherapy combinations including either LEV or VPA in patients with glioma.In this multicenter retrospective observational cohort study, treatment failure (i.e., replacement by, addition of, or withdrawal of an ASM) for any reason was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included (1) treatment failure due to uncontrolled seizures and (2) treatment failure due to adverse effects. Time to treatment failure was estimated from the moment of ASM duotherapy initiation. Multivariable cause-specific Cox proportional hazard models were estimated to study the association between risk factors and treatment failure. The maximum duration of follow-up was 36 months.A total of 1,435 patients were treated with first-line monotherapy LEV or VPA, of which 355 patients received ASM duotherapy after they had treatment failure due to uncontrolled seizures on monotherapy. LEV + VPA was prescribed in 66% (236/355) and other ASM duotherapy combinations including LEV or VPA in 34% (119/355) of patients. Patients using other duotherapy vs LEV + VPA had a higher risk of treatment failure for any reason (cause-specific adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.50 [95% CI 1.07-2.12], p = 0.020), due to uncontrolled seizures (cause-specific aHR 1.73 [95% CI 1.10-2.73], p = 0.018), but not due to adverse effects (cause-specific aHR 0.88 [95% CI 0.47-1.67], p = 0.703).This observational cohort study suggests that LEV + VPA has better efficacy than other ASM combinations. Similar toxicities were experienced in the 2 groups.This study provides Class III evidence that for patients with glioma with uncontrolled seizures on ASM monotherapy, LEV + VPA has better efficacy than other ASM combinations.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Here, potential prognosticators of cancer-specific survival (CSS) were identified based on the contemporary literature and were comprehensively validated in an independent cohort of patients treated for mRCC.Data were collected from 478 patients treated with TT for mRCC between January 1999 and July 2013 at a single institution. The analysis included 25 clinicopathological covariates that included both traditional and contemporary prognosticators. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to quantify the effect of covariates on CSS.Median survival from the initial diagnosis of metastasis was 24.5 (IQR, 11.5-55.7) months. There were 303 (63.4 %) cancer-specific deaths, yielding a 2-year CSS rate of 62.5 %. Low Karnofsky performance status (KPS), hypercalcemia, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the number of metastatic sites (≥2), and the presence of brain metastases were independent adverse prognosticators of CSS. The C-index of the model was 0.78. Patients with at least one adverse prognosticator demonstrated lower 2-year CSS rates compared to those with no prognosticators (53.9 vs. 70.6 %; log rank p < 0.001).Together with traditional prognosticators such as KPS, hypercalcemia, and the number and location of metastases, the NLR was an independent predictor of CSS in patients with mRCC treated with TT.

Among anti-cytokine therapies, interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors have been the most used and studied since the beginning of the pandemic. Going through previous observational studies, subsequent randomised controlled trials, and meta-analyses, we focused on the baseline characteristics of the patients recruited, identifying the most favourable features in the light of positive or negative study outcomes; taking into account the biological significance and predictivity of IL-6 and other biomarkers according to specific thresholds, we ultimately attempted to delineate precise windows for therapeutic intervention. By stimulating scavenger macrophages and T-cell responsivity, IL-6 seems protective against viral replication during asymptomatic infection; still protective on early tissue damage by modulating the release of granzymes and lymphokines in mild-moderate disease; importantly pathogenic in severe disease by inducing the proinflammatory activation of immune and endothelial cells (through trans-signalling and trans-presentation); and again protective in critical disease by exerting homeostatic roles for tissue repair (through cis-signalling), while IL-1 still drives hyperinflammation. IL-6 inhibitors, particularly anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies (e.g., tocilizumab, sarilumab), are effective in severe disease, characterised by baseline IL-6 concentrations ranging from 35 to 90 ng/mL (reached in the circulation within 6 days of hospital admission), a ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen (PaO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) between 100 and 200 mmHg, requirement of high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation, C-reactive protein levels between 120 and 160 mg/L, ferritin levels between 800 and 1600 ng/mL, D-dimer levels between 750 and 3000 ng/mL, and lactate dehydrogenase levels between 350 and 500 U/L. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor inhibitors might have similar windows of opportunity but different age preferences compared to IL-6 inhibitors (over or under 70 years old, respectively). Janus kinase inhibitors (e.g., baricitinib) may also be effective in moderate disease, whereas IL-1 inhibitors (e.g., anakinra) may also be effective in critical disease. Correct use of biologics based on therapeutic windows is essential for successful outcomes and could inform future new trials with more appropriate recruiting criteria.Copyright © 2022 Zizzo, Tamburello, Castelnovo, Laria, Mumoli, Faggioli, Stefani and Mazzone.",NA,29/03/2022,D016428;D016454,10.3389/fimmu.2022.795315,NA,1,1,,

Numerous observational studies, failure analyses, and ""incidence of death"" studies have confirmed that screening reduces deaths in the general population. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) which collects mammographic images from different angles and uses them to synthesize planes through the breast is simply another advance in mammography among others that have been made over the years. DBT ""absolutely"" detects more cancers at a time when cure is more likely while also having the advantage of reducing recall rates. The Tomosynthesis Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (TMIST) has been designed to compare DBT with 2-Dimensional Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM), but it's major design issues may provide misleading results. Instead of using a reduction in deaths as the endpoint, benefit in TMIST is predicated on a reduction in advanced cancers in the DBT group. This is a questionable ""endpoint"" (a reduction in advanced cancers is not necessary as proof of benefit). In addition, the trial may be underpowered so that even if DBT shows a benefit it may not be able to achieve ""statistical significance"". The six CISNET models of the National Cancer Institute have shown that annual mammography beginning at the age of 40 will save the most lives. Yet TMIST will only include women ages 45 and over and will screen postmenopausal women every two years instead of annually. Consequently, TMIST results may be used, inappropriately, to limit access to breast cancer screening starting at the age of 45, and only offer biennial screening for post-menopausal women.Copyright © 2021.

Majority of the physicians use sepsis as a prototype to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 as there are similarities. Heat-killed Mycobacterium w (Mw) (Inj. Mw®) is a known immunomodulator, which is approved for the treatment of gram-negative sepsis. This observational study was aimed to evaluate the role of Mw along with standard of care (SOC) in critically ill COVID-19 patients.Total 448 patients' data (intervention group: 298 in Mw plus SOC vs 150 in SOC alone) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed critically ill COVID-19 patients who were admitted at five tertiary care centers were evaluated. They were observed for changes in laboratory [C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] parameters, hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and discharge status after giving 0.3 mL intradermal Mw for 3 consecutive days along with SOC during hospitalization. Standard of care included injectable steroids, remdesivir, and heparin. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.2 (StataCorp., College Station, Texas, USA).In baseline characteristics, Mw plus SOC arm had more critically ill patients as seen by higher high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) score, higher lab values [CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, LDH, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)], and more oxygen requirement as compared to SOC alone. Mycobacterium w arm had significantly higher mortality rate in ICU and hospital. Both hospital stay and ICU stay were longer in Mw arm. However, subgroup analysis found that early initiation of Mw (<3 days vs >3 days) was associated with significantly lesser odds of mortality and lesser odds of intubation requirement. Early initiation of Mw (<3 days vs >3 days) also resulted in significantly lesser duration of stay in the ICU along with reduction of CRP, D-dimer, and LDH. Moreover, further analysis of early initiation of Mw (<3 days vs control) resulted in significant reduction in lab values (procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer).Mw when added to SOC was found to associate with significantly increased risk of mortality and increased length of hospital stay. However, time since admission to administration of Mw was a significant predictor of in-ICU deaths in multivariate analysis. Early initiation of Mw (<3 days) was observed to be a protective factor against ICU deaths from the multivariate logistic regression model. However, large randomized controlled trials are required to support the same.© Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.",NA,15/07/2022,D016428;D064888,10.5005/japi-11001-0044,NA,1,1,,

This study investigates the clinical course of CCA and subtypes (intrahepatic [iCCA], perihilar [pCCA], and distal [dCCA]) in a pan-European cohort.The ENSCCA Registry is a multicenter observational study. Patients were included if they had a histologically proven diagnosis of CCA between 2010-2019. Demographic, histomorphological, biochemical, and clinical studies were performed.Overall, 2,234 patients were enrolled (male/female=1.29). iCCA (n = 1,243) was associated with overweight/obesity and chronic liver diseases involving cirrhosis and/or viral hepatitis; pCCA (n = 592) with primary sclerosing cholangitis; and dCCA (n = 399) with choledocholithiasis. At diagnosis, 42.2% of patients had local disease, 29.4% locally advanced disease (LAD), and 28.4% metastatic disease (MD). Serum CEA and CA19-9 showed low diagnostic sensitivity, but their concomitant elevation was associated with increased risk of presenting with LAD (odds ratio 2.16; 95% CI 1.43-3.27) or MD (odds ratio 5.88; 95% CI 3.69-9.25). Patients undergoing resection (50.3%) had the best outcomes, particularly with negative-resection margin (R0) (median overall survival [mOS] = 45.1 months); however, margin involvement (R1) (hazard ratio 1.92; 95% CI 1.53-2.41; mOS = 24.7 months) and lymph node invasion (hazard ratio 2.13; 95% CI 1.55-2.94; mOS = 23.3 months) compromised prognosis. Among patients with unresectable disease (49.6%), the mOS was 10.6 months for those receiving active palliative therapies, mostly chemotherapy (26.2%), and 4.0 months for those receiving best supportive care (20.6%). iCCAs were associated with worse outcomes than p/dCCAs.

A Cox proportional hazards model with lasso regularization was used to build a prognostic model for OS using 18 baseline demographic and clinical factors based on the real-world data cohort. The risk-increasing prognostic factors were abnormally low albumin and chloride levels, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score ≥ 2, and abnormally high levels of alkaline phosphatase and white blood cells. The risk-decreasing prognostic factors were PD-L1 positivity, longer time from advanced diagnosis to start of first-line therapy, and higher systolic blood pressure.

Clinicians therefore are faced with the conundrum of synergizing evidence from observational studies, expert opinion, and extrapolation from the general population to provide care to this complex and clinically distinct patient population. In this review, we address clinical risk stratification of patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease using traditional cardiovascular risk factors, noninvasive functional and structural cardiac imaging, invasive coronary angiography, and cardiovascular biomarkers. We highlight the unique characteristics of this population, including the high competing risk of all-cause mortality relative to the risk of major adverse cardiac events, likely owing to important contributions from nonatherosclerotic mechanisms. We further discuss the management of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease, including evidence pertaining to medical management, coronary revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Our discussion includes considerations of drug-eluting versus bare metal stents for percutaneous coronary intervention and off-pump versus on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Finally, we address currently ongoing randomized trials, from which clinicians are optimistic about receiving guidance regarding the best strategies to incorporate into their practice for the evaluation and management of coronary artery disease in this high-risk population.Copyright © 2018.

Data were analyzed at 3 years according to the percutaneous coronary intervention strategy: culprit-only revascularization (COR), 1-stage multivessel revascularization (MVR), and multistage MVR. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE: a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal spontaneous myocardial infarction, or any repeat revascularization). The COR group had a higher risk of MACE than those involving other strategies (COR versus 1-stage MVR; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.77; P<0.001; and COR versus multistage MVR; hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.97; P=0.027).

Models showed an improvement over the interobserver benchmark (multi-delineation dataset; VD 0·91 [IQR 0·83-0·92], p=0·0062; SD 0·86 [0·71-0·91], p=0·0005), and were within the intraobserver benchmark. For primary validation, AI performance on internal Harvard-RT1 data (segmented by the same expert who segmented the discovery data) was VD 0·83 (IQR 0·76-0·88) and SD 0·79 (0·68-0·88), within the interobserver benchmark. Performance on internal Harvard-RT2 data segmented by other experts was VD 0·70 (0·56-0·80) and SD 0·50 (0·34-0·71). Performance on RTOG-0617 clinical trial data was VD 0·71 (0·60-0·81) and SD 0·47 (0·35-0·59), with similar results on diagnostic radiology datasets NSCLC-radiogenomics and Lung-PET-CT-Dx. Despite these geometric overlap results, models yielded target volumes with equivalent radiation dose coverage to those of experts. We also found non-significant differences between de novo expert and AI-assisted segmentations. AI assistance led to a 65% reduction in segmentation time (5·4 min; p<0·0001) and a 32% reduction in interobserver variability (SD; p=0·013).We present a clinical validation strategy for AI models. We found that in silico geometric segmentation metrics might not correlate with clinical utility of the models. Experts' segmentation style and preference might affect model performance.US National Institutes of Health and EU European Research Council.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The efficacy measures were the weighted mean differences (WMDs) for intraocular pressure reduction (IOPR), the reduction in glaucoma medications, and the relative risks (RRs) for success rates. Tolerability estimates were measured by RR for adverse events. The pooled effects were calculated using the random effects model.Sixteen controlled clinical trials meeting the predefined criteria were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 1,825 eyes from 1,392 patients with medically uncontrolled glaucoma were included. The WMD of the IOPR from baseline was 1.12 (95% CI: -0.88 to 3.12) when comparing LBCF with FBCF. LBCF was associated with numerically greater but non-significant IOP lowering efficacy than FBCF (P = 0.270). LBCF was comparable with FBCF in the reduction of glaucoma medication, with a WMD of 0.15 (-0.05 to 0.36) at the follow-up endpoint (P = 0.141).

Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by comparing the App-diagnoses with the final discharge diagnoses. Timing of diagnosis and time to treatment were correlated with complications, overall survival, and length of hospital stay.In this prospective, double-blinded study, 450 patients were enrolled and followed up until day 90. Ada suggested the final discharge diagnosis in 52.0% (95% CI [0.47, 0.57]) of patients compared with the classic doctor-patient interaction, which was significantly superior with 80.9% (95% CI [0.77, 0.84], P <0.001). However, when diagnostic accuracy of both were assessed together, Ada significantly increased the accuracy rate (87.3%, P <0.001), when compared with the ER physician alone. Patients with an early time point of diagnosis and rapid treatment allocation exhibited significantly reduced complications ( P< 0.001) and length of hospital stay ( P< 0.001).Currently, the classic patient-physician interaction is superior to an AI-based diagnostic tool applied by patients. However, AI tools have the potential to additionally benefit the diagnostic efficacy of clinicians and improve quality of care.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The current study was designed to investigate the feasibility of using computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) techniques to extract EUS image parameters for the differential diagnosis of PC and chronic pancreatitis (CP).This study recruited 262 patients with PC and 126 patients with CP. Typical EUS images were selected from the sample sets. Texture features were extracted from the region of interest using computer-based techniques. Then the distance between class algorithm and sequential forward selection (SFS) algorithm were used for a better combination of features; and, later, a support vector machine (SVM) predictive model was built, trained, and validated. Overall, 105 features of 9 categories were extracted from the EUS images for pattern classification. Of these features, the 16 were selected as a better combination of features. Then, SVM predictive model was built and trained. The total cases were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set. The training set was used to train the SVM, and the testing set was used to evaluate the performance of the SVM.

Whether histology adds incremental value beyond usual donor attributes in assessing allograft quality is unknown.This population-based study included patients who received a deceased donor kidney that had been biopsied before implantation according to a prespecified protocol in France and Belgium, where preimplantation biopsy findings are generally not used for decision making in the allocation process. We also studied kidneys that had been acquired from deceased United States donors for transplantation that were biopsied during allocation and discarded because of low organ quality. Using donor and recipient characteristics, we fit multivariable Cox models for death-censored graft failure and examined whether predictive accuracy (C index) improved after adding donor histology. We matched the discarded United States kidneys to similar kidneys transplanted in Europe and calculated predicted allograft survival.In the development cohort of 1629 kidney recipients at two French centers, adding donor histology to the model did not significantly improve prediction of long-term allograft failure. Analyses using an external validation cohort from two Belgian centers confirmed the lack of improved accuracy from adding histology. About 45% of 1103 United States kidneys discarded because of histologic findings could be accurately matched to very similar kidneys that had been transplanted in France; these discarded kidneys would be expected to have allograft survival of 93.1% at 1 year, 80.7% at 5 years, and 68.9% at 10 years.In this multicenter study, donor kidney histology assessment during allocation did not provide substantial incremental value in ascertaining organ quality.

A comparison group of 5057 siblings of cancer survivors were also included.Cumulative incidence and 95% confidence intervals of reported heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, and arrhythmias by treatment decade. Events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Multivariable subdistribution hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios by decade, and mediation analysis examined risks with and without exposure to cardiotoxic treatments.The 20 year cumulative incidence of heart failure (0.69% for those treated in the 1970s, 0.74% for those treated in the 1980s, 0.54% for those treated in the 1990s) and coronary artery disease (0.38%, 0.24%, 0.19%, respectively), decreased in more recent eras (P<0.01), though not for valvular disease (0.06%, 0.06%, 0.05%), pericardial disease (0.04%, 0.02%, 0.03%), or arrhythmias (0.08%, 0.09%, 0.13%). Compared with survivors with a diagnosis in the 1970s, the risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease decreased in the 1980s and 1990s but only significantly for coronary artery disease (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.92 and 0.53, 0.36 to 0.77, respectively).

Early identification and prediction of patients at risk of sepsis and adverse outcomes associated with sepsis are critical. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm that can predict sepsis early. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of an observational cohort study from the Intensive Care Unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. A total of 4,449 infected patients were randomly assigned to the development and validation data set at a ratio of 4:1. After extracting electronic medical record data, a set of 55 features (variables) was calculated and passed to the random forest algorithm to predict the onset of sepsis. Results: The pre-procedure clinical variables were used to build a prediction model from the training data set using the random forest machine learning method; a 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model. Finally, we tested the model using the validation data set. The area obtained by the model under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.91, the sensitivity was 87%, and the specificity was 89%. Conclusions: This newly established machine learning-based model has shown good predictive ability in Chinese sepsis patients.

However, there is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) systematic review that evaluates the impact of vaccination on all-cause mortality compared to no vaccination in this particular population. Our objective is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of pneumococcal vaccination in the referred population.We searched CENTRAL and MEDLINE for relevant RCTs and observational studies. Data were screened, extracted, and appraised by two independent reviewers. We pooled results using a random effects model, and used hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess measure of effect. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and we assessed the confidence in the evidence using the GRADE framework. No RCTs were found. Seven observational studies were included for analyses. Pooled results from five studies enrolling a total of 163 756 participants showed a significant decrease in all-cause mortality (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73-0.83, very low confidence), without statistically significant heterogeneity (χ2 test P = 0.21; I2 = 32%).Pneumococcal vaccination was associated with a 22% decrease of all-cause mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease or at a very high cardiovascular risk. However, limitations due to study design and the serious risk of bias in three of the included studies leads to a decreased level of result confidence.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The aim of this exploratory study was to compare the time to treatment discontinuation between patients with schizophrenia prescribed brexpiprazole (BRX group) and those prescribed other atypical antipsychotics (OAA group) in clinical settings in Japan using health insurance claims data.De-identified data of working individuals with schizophrenia aged < 75 years and their dependents were assessed from April 2017 to May 2020 using a nationwide claims database. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for baseline patient variables, were used to compare the time to treatment discontinuation (primary outcome) for 180 days between BRX and OAA groups and to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The cumulative treatment continuation rates at 180 days were also estimated. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted for the primary outcome.The analysis included 978 and 4898 patients in the BRX and OAA groups, respectively. Patients in the BRX group were significantly less likely to discontinue treatment than those in the OAA group (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.95; p = 0.0024). The cumulative treatment continuation rates were higher in the BRX group (45.9%, 95% CI 42.5-49.2]) than in the OAA group (39.5%, 95% CI 38.1-41.0; log-rank test, p < 0.0001). Based on patients matched by propensity score, the BRX group was significantly less likely to discontinue treatment than the OAA group (log-rank test, p = 0.0466). Similar results were obtained in sensitivity and subgroup analyses.This real-world study showed that patients in the BRX group were less likely to discontinue treatments than those in the OAA group.

Prospective comparison (200 nodules) showed that the AUC of the PKU-M model [0.871 (0.815-0.915)] was higher than that of surgeons [0.790 (0.711-0.852), 0.741 (0.662-0.804), and 0.727 (0.650-0.788)], radiologist [0.748 (0.671-0.814)], and the CADx system [0.757 (0.682-0.818)]. Furthermore, the model outperformed the clinicians with an increase of 14.3% in sensitivity and 7.8% in specificity.After its development using machine learning algorithms, validation using transnational multicentric cohorts, and prospective comparison with clinicians and the CADx system, this novel prediction model for MPNs presented solid performance as a convenient reference to help decision-making.©2021 American Association for Cancer Research.",NA,26/02/2021,D016428;D016448;D013485;D023361,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-4007,NA,1,1,1,

Results from a tertiary cancer center with 288 treated patients.,"Accompanied by the demographic change, the number of octogenarian cancer patients with bone metastases will increase in the future. Palliative radiotherapy constitutes an effective analgesic treatment; however, as pain perception and bone metabolism change with increasing age, the analgesic efficacy of radiotherapy may be altered in elderly patients. We therefore investigated the treatment outcomes of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases in octogenarians.Patients between 80 and 89 years undergoing radiotherapy for bone metastases between 2009 and 2019 at a tertiary cancer center were analyzed for patterns-of-care, pain response and overall survival (OS). Logistic regression analyses were carried out to examine parameters associated with pain response, and Cox analyses were conducted to reveal prognostic parameters for OS.A total of 288 patients with 516 irradiated lesions were included in the analysis. The majority (n = 249, 86%) completed all courses of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy led to pain reduction in 176 patients (61%) at the end of treatment. Complete pain relief at the first follow-up was achieved in 84 patients (29%). Bisphosphonate administration was significantly associated with higher rates of pain response at the first follow-up (p < 0.05). Median OS amounted to 9 months, and 1-year, 2-year and 3-year OS were 43%, 28% and 17%. In the multivariate analysis, ECOG (p < 0.001), Mizumoto score (p < 0.01) and Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) (p < 0.001) were independent prognosticators for OS.Palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases constitutes a feasible and effective analgesic treatment in octogenarian patients. ECOG, Mizumoto score and SINS are prognosic variables for survival and may aid treatment decisions regarding radiotherapy fractionation in this patient group. Single-fraction radiotherapy with 8 Gy should be applied for patients with uncomplicated bone metastases and poor prognosis. Prospective trials focusing on quality of life of these very old cancer patients with bone metastases are warranted to reveal the optimal radiotherapeutic management for this vulnerable population.© 2022.

This problem is compounded in neurosurgical patients, in whom postoperative intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) may be catastrophic, compared to non-neuraxial bleeding in other types of surgery. Current major guidelines recommend caution when using pharmacological prophylaxis in elective cranial surgery, but incorporate low-quality evidence and lack precise guidance on timing and duration of anticoagulation.We aimed to answer the following questions for patients undergoing elective cranial surgery: (1) when is the optimal time to initiate postoperative anticoagulation, and (2) how long should postoperative anticoagulation be continued for? In this systematic review, we screened randomised and non-randomised studies reporting original data on pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in elective cranial surgery. Outcomes of interest were VTE and ICH.Three retrospective, single-centre observational studies met eligibility criteria, with a total of 923 participants. Meta-analysis was not performed due to a high risk of bias across all studies. Through narrative synthesis, we found that patients who developed VTE were significantly more likely to receive their first postoperative dose at a later time (mean: 144 vs. 29 h, p = .04). Shorter courses of anticoagulation (<7 days) were associated with significantly lower ICH rates (p = .03) compared to longer courses (>21 days).The limited evidence favours earlier initiation and shorter courses of thromboprophylactic anticoagulation. These findings are specific to patients undergoing surgery for meningioma or glioma and may not apply to other populations.

Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), including oleic acid, are associated with lower CVD risk. Measurement of flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery (FMD) is the gold standard for measuring endothelial function and predicts CVD risk. This study examined the effect of partially replacing SFA with MUFA from conventional canola oil and high-oleic acid canola oil on FMD. Participants (n = 31) with an elevated waist circumference plus ≥1 additional metabolic syndrome criterion completed FMD measures as part of the Canola Oil Multi-Centre Intervention Trial 2 (COMIT-2), a multi-center, double-blind, three-period crossover, controlled feeding randomized trial. Diet periods were 6 weeks, separated by ≥4-week washouts. Experimental diets were provided during all feeding periods. Diets only differed by the fatty acid profile of the oils: canola oil (CO; 17.5% energy from MUFA, 9.2% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), 6.6% SFA), high-oleic acid canola oil (HOCO; 19.1% MUFA, 7.0% PUFA, 6.4% SFA), and a control oil blend (CON; 11% MUFA, 10% PUFA, 12% SFA). Multilevel models were used to examine the effect of the diets on FMD.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using provincial health administrative data to evaluate whether the combined presence of opioid use and OSA increases the risk of adverse health consequences, such as mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits; and if it does, whether this co-occurrence has synergistic clinical relevance.We included all adults who underwent a diagnostic sleep study in Ontario, Canada, between 2013 and 2016. Individuals were considered exposed to opioids if they filled a prescription that overlapped with the date of their sleep study (Opioid+). Individuals with at least a 50% probability of having a diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA (OSA+) were identified using a previously externally validated case-ascertainment model. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were all-cause or ischemic heart disease hospitalizations, all-cause ED visits, and motor vehicle collisions (MVC) requiring hospital or ED visit. We used multivariable Cox regression models to compare hazards between four mutually exclusive groups: (1) Opioid+ OSA+; (2) Opioid+ OSA-; (3) Opioid- OSA+, and (4) OSA- Opioid- (reference for comparison). Relative excess risks due to interaction (RERI) were calculated to test for additive interaction.Of 300,663 adults who underwent a sleep study, 15,713 (5.2%) were considered as Opioid+ and 128,351 (42.7%) as OSA+. Over a median of two years, 6,223 (2.1%) died from any cause. Regardless of OSA status, opioid use at the date of the sleep study was associated with an increased hazard for all-cause mortality with the greatest hazard associated with Opioid+ OSA- (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.75, 95% CI 1.57-1.94), but not Opioid+ OSA+ (aHR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.27) as hypothesized. Regardless of OSA status, opioid use at the date of the sleep study was associated with an increased hazard for all secondary outcomes. Opioid+ OSA+ was associated with the greatest hazards of all-cause hospitalizations (aHR 1.55, 95% CI 1.49-1.61) and MVC (aHR of 1.39; 95% CI 1.09-1.77); however, no statistically significant synergistic effects were observed.Adults referred for sleep disorder assessment who used opioids had a significantly increased hazard of adverse health outcomes than those who did not, regardless of whether they had a high probability of moderate to severe OSA. The use of opioids and OSA was associated with the greatest hazard of all-cause hospitalizations and MVC requiring hospital or ED visit. The interaction of opioids and OSA did not confer a synergistic risk for poor outcomes.",NA,29/06/2022,D016428;D013485;D052061,10.1371/journal.pone.0269112,NA,1,1,,

The authors formulated 10 questions regarding organization of care. The questions were focused on guidance, multidisciplinary decision-making, and data storage. A digital questionnaire was synthesized and included quality control. The digital questionnaire was sent to 54 representative members of EMSOS. We did not receive responses from 29 representative countries (53.7%) after one digital invitation and two digital reminders.We received data from 25 representatives of bone sarcoma centers from 17 countries across Europe (46.3%).

In 64.7% of the countries, a national bone tumor guideline regarding for diagnosis and treatment is used in oncological care. A national bone tumor board for extensive case evaluation including classification and advice for treatment is available for 47.1% of the countries. All participating bone sarcoma centers have a mandatory local multidisciplinary meeting before the start of treatment; in 84.0% this meeting takes place once a week. During this multidisciplinary meeting a median of 15 cases (range, 4-40 cases) are discussed. In terms of storage of oncological data, a local registry is used in eight countries (47.1%). A national registry is used in eight countries (47.1%).A national bone tumor board gives bone sarcoma centers with little adherence the opportunity to gain knowledge from a more experienced team.

Cholestasis is a presenting feature of BA, as well as other diagnoses (Non-BA). Identification of clinical features of neonatal cholestasis that would expedite decisions to pursue subsequent invasive testing to correctly diagnose or exclude BA would enhance outcomes. The analytical goal was to develop a predictive model for BA using data available at initial presentation.Infants at presentation with neonatal cholestasis (direct/conjugated bilirubin >2 mg/dl [34.2 μM]) were enrolled prior to surgical exploration in a prospective observational multi-centered study (PROBE-NCT00061828). Clinical features (physical findings, laboratory results, gallbladder sonography) at enrollment were analyzed. Initially, 19 features were selected as candidate predictors. Two approaches were used to build models for diagnosis prediction: a hierarchical classification and regression decision tree (CART) and a logistic regression model using a stepwise selection strategy.In PROBE April 2004-February 2014, 401 infants met criteria for BA and 259 for Non-BA. Univariate analysis identified 13 features that were significantly different between BA and Non-BA. Using a CART predictive model of BA versus Non-BA (significant factors: gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, acholic stools, weight), the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) was 0.83. Twelve percent of BA infants were misclassified as Non-BA; 17% of Non-BA infants were misclassified as BA. Stepwise logistic regression identified seven factors in a predictive model (ROC AUC 0.89). Using this model, a predicted probability of >0.8 (n = 357) yielded an 81% true positive rate for BA; <0.2 (n = 120) yielded an 11% false negative rate.Despite the relatively good accuracy of our optimized prediction models, the high precision required for differentiating BA from Non-BA was not achieved. Accurate identification of BA in infants with neonatal cholestasis requires further evaluation, and BA should not be excluded based only on presenting clinical features.",U01 DK062481|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|U01 DK103140|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|P30 DK078392|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|U01 DK062436|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|UL1 TR001108|NCATS NIH HHS|United States|U01 DK062466|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|U01 DK084575|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|UL1 TR000454|NCATS NIH HHS|United States|U01 DK084536|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|U01 DK062456|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|U01 DK103149|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|U01 DK062500|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|U01 DK062497|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States,12/05/2017,D016430;D016428;D016448,10.1371/journal.pone.0176275,NA,1,0,,

Therefore, it was the aim of this study to develop an easy-to-perform score distinguishing F3 and F4 fibrosis in NAFLD. A derivation cohort comprising 251 NAFLD patients with F3 or F4 was used to develop the NAFLD Cirrhosis Score (NCS). The NCS was validated in three independent cohorts with liver histology comprising 1666 participants from the STELLAR trials, 47 patients from China and 2058 patients from the European NAFLD Registry. A model including INR, gGT, ALT, platelets and age discriminated best between patients with bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.733 (95%CI 0.671-0.795). The diagnostic performance of the NCS was similar in the STELLAR studies (AUC 0.700; 95%CI 0.680-0.730) and a smaller cohort from China (AUC 0.727; 95%CI 0.533-0.921). In the European NAFLD Registry, spanning all histological fibrosis stages, the NCS exhibited an AUC of 0.798 (95%CI 0.766-0.830) to detect cirrhosis. We derived two NCS cut-off values (<64.5 and >79.17) to classify patients at low, intermediate, or high risk for the presence of cirrhosis. Using these cut-offs, further diagnostic workup could be avoided by ruling in or ruling out cirrhosis in approximately half of the patients. Furthermore, NCS identified patients at risk for progression to cirrhosis in the F3 cohort and liver-related outcomes in the F4 cohort. CONCLUSION: The NCS is a simple tool to improve the identification of compensated cirrhosis within the large group of advanced disease stage and provides prognostic information. Overall, the differentiation of F3 from F4 disease using standard laboratory remains difficult and does not exceed moderate accuracy.Copyright © 2022.

Outcome prediction and therapy are challenging due to the scarcity of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or well-designed observational studies focused on this population.Narrative review with a focus on the contributions provided by the ongoing multinational INCREMENT-SOT consortium (ClinicalTrials identifier NCT02852902) in the fields of epidemiology and clinical management.The Spanish Society of Transplantation (SET), the Group for Study of Infection in Transplantation of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (GESITRA-SEIMC), and the Spanish Network for Research in Infectious Diseases (REIPI) recently published their recommendations for the management of MDR GNB infections in SOT recipients. We revisit the SET/GESITRA-SEIMC/REIPI document taking into consideration new evidence that emerged on the molecular epidemiology, prognostic stratification, and treatment of post-transplant ESBL-E and CRE infections. Results derived from the INCREMENT-SOT consortium may support the therapeutic approach to post-transplant bloodstream infection (BSI). The initiatives devoted to sparing the use of carbapenems in low-risk ESBL-E BSI or to repurposing existing non-β-lactam antibiotics for CRE in both non-transplant and transplant patients are reviewed, as well as the eventual positioning in the specific SOT setting of recently approved antibiotics.Due to the clinical complexity and relative rarity of ESBL-E and CRE infections in SOT recipients, multinational cooperative efforts such as the INCREMENT-SOT Project should be encouraged.

This study aims to explore the potential causal relationship between circulating vitamin C and risk of five most common cancers in Europe.We used summary-level data for genetic variants associated with plasma vitamin C in a large vitamin C genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis on 52,018 Europeans, and the corresponding associations with lung, breast, prostate, colon, and rectal cancer from GWAS consortia including up to 870,984 participants of European ancestry. We performed two-sample, bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using inverse-variance-weighted method as the primary approach, while using 6 additional methods (e.g., MR-Egger, weighted median-based, and mode-based methods) as sensitivity analysis to detect and adjust for pleiotropy. We also conducted a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials to examine the association of vitamin C intakes with cancer outcomes.The MR analysis showed no evidence of a causal association of circulating vitamin C concentration with any examined cancer. Although the odds ratio (OR) per one standard deviation increase in genetically predicted circulating vitamin C concentration was 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.57) for breast cancer in the UK Biobank, this association could not be replicated in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium with an OR of 1.05 (0.94 to 1.17). Smoking initiation, as a positive control for our reverse MR analysis, showed a negative association with circulating vitamin C concentration. However, there was no strong evidence of a causal association of any examined cancer with circulating vitamin C. Sensitivity analysis using 6 different analytical approaches yielded similar results. Moreover, our MR results were consistent with the null findings from the meta-analysis exploring prospective associations of dietary or supplemental vitamin C intakes with cancer risk, except that higher dietary vitamin C intake, but not vitamin C supplement, was associated with a lower risk of lung cancer (risk ratio: 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.99).These findings provide no evidence to support that physiological-level circulating vitamin C has a large effect on risk of the five most common cancers in European populations, but we cannot rule out very small effect sizes.© 2021.

The primary outcome was the composite of revascularization, myocardial infarction, or cardiac death at 5 years.The mean FFR was 0.88 ± 0.08, and PCI was performed in 239 vessels. The primary outcome occurred in 54 vessels (6.2%). All high-risk morphological attributes were associated with the increased risk of adverse outcomes after adjustment for FFR ≤0.8 and demonstrated direct prognostic effect not mediated by FFR ≤0.8. The 5-year event risk proportionally increased as the number of HRA increased (p for trend <0.001) with lower risk in the PCI group than the medical treatment group in vessels with 1 or 2 HRA (9.7% vs. 14.7%), but not in vessels with either 0 or ≥3 HRA. Of the vessels with pre-procedural FFR ≤0.8, ischemia relief by PCI (pre-PCI FFR ≤0.8 and post-PCI FFR >0.8) significantly reduced vessel-oriented composite outcome risk compared with medical treatment alone in vessels with 0 or 1 high-risk morphological attributes (hazard ratio: 0.33; 95% confidence interval: 0.12 to 0.93; p = 0.035), but the risk reduction was attenuated in vessels with ≥2 high-risk morphological attributes.High-risk morphological attributes offered additive prognostic value to coronary physiology and may optimize selection of treatment strategies by adding to FFR-based risk predictions (CCTA-FFR Registry for Development of Comprehensive Risk Prediction Model; NCT04037163).Copyright © 2021 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Having cardiac rehabilitation and a secondary prevention program in place is a class IA recommendation for individuals with coronary artery disease. WeChat-based interventions seem to be feasible and efficient for the follow-up and management of chronic diseases.This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a tertiary A-level hospital, WeChat-based telemedicine intervention in comparison with conventional community hospital follow-up on medication adherence and risk factor control in individuals with stable coronary artery disease.In this multicenter prospective study, 1424 patients with stable coronary artery disease in Beijing, China, were consecutively enrolled between September 2018 and September 2019 from the Fuwai Hospital and 4 community hospitals. At 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, participants received healthy lifestyle recommendations and medication advice. Subsequently, the control group attended an offline outpatient clinic at 4 separate community hospitals. The intervention group had follow-up visits through WeChat-based telemedicine management. The main end point was medication adherence, which was defined as participant compliance in taking all 4 cardioprotective medications that would improve the patient's outcome (therapies included antiplatelet therapy, β-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers). Multivariable generalized estimating equations were used to compare the primary and secondary outcomes between the 2 groups and to calculate the relative risk (RR) at 12 months. Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting were performed as sensitivity analyses, and propensity scores were calculated using a multivariable logistic regression model.At 1 year, 88% (565/642) of patients in the intervention group and 91.8% (518/564) of patients in the control group had successful follow-up data. We matched 257 pairs of patients between the intervention and control groups. There was no obvious advantage in medication adherence with the 4 cardioprotective drugs in the intervention group (172/565, 30.4%, vs 142/518, 27.4%; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-1.02; P=.65). The intervention measures improved smoking cessation (44/565, 7.8%, vs 118/518, 22.8%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.44-0.53; P<.001) and alcohol restriction (33/565, 5.8%, vs 91/518, 17.6%; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.42-0.54; P<.001).The tertiary A-level hospital, WeChat-based intervention did not improve adherence to the 4 cardioprotective medications compared with the traditional method. Tertiary A-level hospital, WeChat-based interventions have a positive effect on improving lifestyle, such as quitting drinking and smoking, in patients with stable coronary artery disease and can be tried as a supplement to community hospital follow-up.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04795505; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04795505.©Boqun Shi, Xi Liu, Qiuting Dong, Yuxiu Yang, Zhongxing Cai, Haoyu Wang, Dong Yin, Hongjian Wang, Kefei Dou, Weihua Song.

This multicenter cohort study aims to evaluate time on the waiting list, dropout rate, and graft survival before and after introducing the macro-area sharing policy.A total of 4,238 patients registered from 2010 to 2018 were enrolled and categorized into an ERA-1 Group (n = 2,013; before August 2014) and an ERA-2 Group (n = 2,225; during and after August 2014). A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of receiving a LT or death between the two eras. The Fine-Gray model was used to estimate the HR for dropout from the waiting list and graft loss, considering death as a competing risk event. A Fine-Gray model was also used to estimate risk factors of graft loss.Patients with MELD ≥30 had a lower median time on the waiting list (4 vs.12 days, p <0.001) and a higher probability of being transplanted (HR 2.27; 95% CI 1.78-2.90; p = 0.001) in ERA-2 compared to ERA-1. The subgroup analysis on 3,515 LTs confirmed ERA-2 (odds ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.46-0.68; p = 0.001) as a protective factor for better graft survival rate. The protective variables for lower dropouts on the waiting list were: ERA-2, high-volume centers, no competition centers, male recipients, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The protective variables for graft loss were high-volume center and ERA-2, while MELD ≥30 remained related to a higher risk of graft loss.The national MELD ≥30 priority allocation was associated with improved patient outcomes, although MELD ≥30 was associated with a higher risk of graft loss. Transplant center volumes and competition among centers may have a role in recipient prioritization and outcomes.NCT04530240 LAY SUMMARY: Italy introduced a new policy in 2014 to give national allocation priority to patients with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥30 (i.e. very sick patients). This policy has led to more liver transplants, fewer dropouts, and shorter waiting times for patients with MELD ≥30. However, a higher risk of graft loss still burdens these cases. Transplant center volumes and competition among centers may have a role in recipient prioritization and outcomes.Copyright © 2021 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Previous studies have shown that astragaloside IV plays an important role in the control of early- and mid-stage diabetes and late diabetic nephropathy. However, it is disappointing that the in vivo solubility of astragaloside IV and its bioavailability after oral administration are very low. We recently obtained a new water-soluble derivative of astragaloside IV-astragaloside formic acid (LS-102), which has higher bioavailability than the parent compound. In our previous study, we found that there was a significant inflammatory response in the perirenal adipose tissue of mice with obesity-related nephropathy induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), which was related to macrophage infiltration. We hypothesized that in model mice with obesity-related nephropathy, LS-102 effectively regulated the inflammatory response and pathological changes in obesity-related nephropathy through macrophages in perirenal adipose tissue. If this hypothesis is true, the effects of LS-102 and astragaloside IV on TGF-β1/Smad signal transduction will be further investigated.In this study, adipose stem cells and an HFD-induced obesity-related nephropathy mouse model were used to observe the regulatory effect of LS-102 on perirenal fat inflammation and the mechanism. Adipose mesenchymal stem cells were extracted from mice that were fed a normal diet and those with obesity-related nephropathy. The effects of LS-102 on the proliferation of two kinds of cells were measured by the CCK-8 method. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-a) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured by ELISA. Obesity-related nephropathy mice were randomly divided into five groups: the HFD group, the LAS group (HFD+low concentration of astragaloside IV [10 mg/kg], intragastrically [ig]), the HAS group (HFD+high concentration of astragaloside IV [40 mg/kg], ig), the L102 group (HFD+low concentration of LS-102 [10 mg/kg], ig) and the H102 group (HFD+high concentration of LS-102 [40 mg/kg], ig). Body weight was measured, and the levels of serum glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), serum creatinine (Crea) and blood urea were measured. The kidneys were stained with HE, PAS and Masson's trichrome. Perirenal adipose tissue was harvested to examine the expression of CD68, LCA, CD11C, TNF-a, TGF-β1, Fn1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 by immunohistochemical staining, and F4/80 was examined by immunofluorescence staining.LS-102 significantly inhibited the in vitro secretion of TNF-a and PAI-1 by adipose stem cells in a concentration-dependent manner (P < 0.05). In vivo, the body weights in the LAS group, HAS group, L102 group and H102 group were significantly lower than those in the HFD group (P < 0.05). Except for that in the HFD group, the volume of perirenal adipocytes in the other groups was small and uniform (P < 0.05). Compared with the LAS, HAS, L102 and H102 groups, the HFD group had a larger glomerular cross-sectional area, proliferation of mesangial cells and the mesangial matrix, and increased matrix area/glomerular area (P < 0.05). The effect of LS-102 was better than that of astragaloside IV at the same concentration (P < 0.05). Compared with those in the HFD group, glucose, HDL-C, LDL-C and urea levels in the LAS group, HAS group, L102 group and H102 group were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The expression of F4/80, CD68, LCA, TNF-a, CD11C, and PAI-1 in perirenal adipose tissue in the HFD group was significantly higher than that in the LAS group, HAS group, L102 group and H102 group (P < 0.05). Compared with those in the HFD group, the expression levels of TGF-β1 and Fn1 in the HAS group, L102 group and H102 group were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Compared with the HFD group, the HAS group, L102 group and H102 group had decreased immunopositive rates of Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 (P < 0.05). At the same concentration, the effect of LS-102 was better than that of astragaloside IV (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression of Smad7 among the different experimental groups (P > 0.05).Astragaloside IV and LS-102 improved the inflammatory reaction in perirenal adipose tissue and renal pathological changes in obesity-related nephropathy model mice and inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad signaling cascade. At the same concentration, the effect of LS-102 was better than that of astragaloside IV. These results suggest that LS-102 has a better protective effect against obesity-related nephropathy. LS-102 may be a new type of traditional Chinese medicine for the clinical treatment of obesity and its related metabolic diseases.© 2022 Li et al.",NA,22/03/2022,D016428;D000081262,10.2147/DDDT.S346546,NA,1,1,,

The outcomes of clinical trials may underestimate treatment-related adverse events due to restrictive eligibility, limited sample size, and failure to anticipate selected toxicities. We evaluated the incidence and clinical determinants of CVAEs in real-world population on ICI therapy.Among 2 687 301 patients diagnosed with cancer from 2011 to 2018, 16 574 received ICIs for any cancer. Patients in the ICI and non-ICI cohorts were matched in a 1 : 1 ratio according to age, sex, National Cancer Institute comorbidity score, and primary cancer. The non-ICI cohort was stratified into patients who received chemotherapy (N = 2875) or targeted agents (N = 4611). All CVAEs, non-cardiac immune-related adverse events occurring after treatment initiation, baseline comorbidities, and treatment details were identified and analyzed using diagnosis and billing codes.Median age was 61 and 65 years in the ICI and non-ICI cohorts, respectively (P < 0.001). ICI patients were predominantly male (P < 0.001). Lung cancer (43.1%), melanoma (30.4%), and renal cell carcinoma (9.9%) were the most common cancer types. CVAE diagnoses in our dataset by incidence proportion (ICI cohort) were stroke (4.6%), heart failure (3.5%), atrial fibrillation (2.1%), conduction disorders (1.5%), myocardial infarction (0.9%), myocarditis (0.05%), vasculitis (0.05%), and pericarditis (0.2%). Anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 increased the risk of heart failure [versus anti-programmed cell death protein 1; hazard ratio (HR), 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-2.84] and stroke (HR, 1.7; 95% CI 1.3-2.22). Pneumonitis was associated with heart failure (HR, 2.61; 95% CI 1.23-5.52) and encephalitis with conduction disorders (HR, 4.35; 95% CI 1.6-11.87) in patients on ICIs. Advanced age, primary cancer, nephritis, and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 therapy were commonly associated with CVAEs in the adjusted Cox proportional hazards model.Our findings underscore the importance of risk stratification and cardiovascular monitoring for patients on ICI therapy.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) study population included participants with a diagnosis of suspected acute stroke, (2) intervention included the use of telemedicine systems to aid assessment, diagnosis, or treatment in acute stroke, and (3) outcomes measured related to feasibility in clinical practice, acceptability to patients, carers, and staff, reliability of telemedicine systems, and effectiveness in delivering treatment, especially tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Overall, 17 relevant non-randomised studies reported that telemedicine systems were feasible and acceptable. Interrater reliability was excellent for global clinical assessments and decisions on radiological exclusion criteria although agreement for individual assessment items was more variable.

Evidence have shown urine microscopy could help early detection, differentiating the causes and predicting the progression of AKI. However, little evidence is available on AKI after non-cardiac surgery. Thus, we investigated the association between urine microscopy and severe AKI in critically ill patients after non-cardiac surgery.This was a single-center prospective cohort study. The primary outcome was severe AKI, defined as stage 2 or 3 according to maximal KDIGO criteria within 7 days following non-cardiac surgery. Urine microscopy immediately, 6 and 12 hours after surgical intensive care unit (SICU) admission were examined and graded by a urine microscopy score (UMS) based on the observed quantification of renal tubular cells and casts in the sediment. Then, multivariate Logistic regression models were used to analyze the associations between UMS and postoperative severe AKI.From May 20, 2019 to November 24, 2020, 661 patients were enrolled with 147 patients (22.2%) developing postoperative severe AKI. Multivariate Logistic regression model showed elevated UMS (≥1) 6 and 12 hours after SICU admission were independently associated with postoperative severe AKI (OR 2.200, 95% CI: 1.182-4.095, P=0.013 and OR 2.949, 95% CI: 1.657-5.248, P<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, higher UMS 6 hours after SICU admission demonstrated correlation with greater risk of severe AKI with OR 3.887 (95% CI: 1.430-10.563) for UMS ≥3 and OR 2.429 (95% CI: 1.237-4.770) for UMS =1-2.

This study evaluates the actual 2-year progression within the IMI-APPROACH, in relation to the predicted-progression scores.Actual structural progression was measured using minimum joint space width (minJSW). Actual pain (progression) was evaluated using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) pain questionnaire. Progression was presented as actual change (Δ) after 2 years, and as progression over 2 years based on a per patient fitted regression line using 0, 0.5, 1 and 2-year values. Differences in predicted-progression scores between actual progressors and non-progressors were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) reported. Using Youden's index, optimal cut-offs were chosen to enable evaluation of both predicted-progression scores to identify actual progressors.Actual structural progressors were initially assigned higher S predicted-progression scores compared with structural non-progressors. Likewise, actual pain progressors were assigned higher P predicted-progression scores compared with pain non-progressors.

We also highlighted the role of left ventricular assist devices in the management of this condition. The benefits and limitations of each intervention are highlighted.There is currently no unanimous and shared strategy for the optimal treatment of patients with secondary IMR.

Our goal was to investigate the predictive value of the clinical findings and establish a scoring system to predict chemotherapy response.We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study and reviewed 322 patients with primary high-grade bone sarcomas. Patients who routinely received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent primary tumor resection with an assessment of tumor necrosis rate (TNR) were enrolled in this study. The medical records of patients were collected from November 1, 2011, to March 1, 2018, at Peking University People's Hospital (PKUPH) and Peking University Shougang Hospital (PKUSH). The mean age of the patients was 16.2 years (range 3-52 years), of whom 65.5% were male. The clinical data collected before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy included the degree of pain, laboratory inspection, X-ray, CT, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR), and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). Several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, were used to classify the chemotherapy responses. Area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system to predict chemotherapy response is the primary outcome measure.For patients without events, a minimum follow-up of 24 months was achieved. The median follow-up time was 43.3 months, and it ranged from 24 to 84 months. The 5 years progression-free survival (PFS) of the included patients was 54.1%. The 5 years PFS rate was 39.7% for poor responders and 74.9% for good responders. Features such as longest diameter reduction ratio (up to three points), clear bone boundary formation (up to two points), tumor necrosis measured by magnetic resonance (up to two points), maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax ) decrease (up to three points), and significant alkaline phosphatase decrease (up to 1 point) were identified as significant predictors of good histological response and constituted the scoring system. A score ≥4 predicts a good response to chemotherapy. The scoring system based on the above factors performed well, achieving an AUC of 0.893. For nonmeasurable lesions (classified by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST 1.1]), the AUC was 0.901.We first devised a well-performing comprehensive scoring system to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in primary high-grade bone sarcomas.© 2022 The Authors.

We evaluated the effects of serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR on parameters and outcomes. The main outcome measures were anthropometric, biometric and ultrasound parameters at baseline and the clinical outcomes of ovulation, conception, pregnancy, live birth and pregnancy loss.The relevant analysis between hyperinsulinaemia and IR and clinical characteristics showed that weight, waist and hip circumference, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, acanthosis nigricans score and menstrual period were significantly correlated with fasting insulin (FIN) and HOMA-IR. There was no significant correlation between the hirsutism score or acne score with FIN or HOMA-IR. The relevant analysis between hyperinsulinaemia and IR and circulating sex steroids and gonadotrophins showed that FAI was significantly correlated with FIN and HOMA-IR (r = 0.240, P < 0.001 and r = 0.191, P < 0.001, respectively). Free testosterone was significantly correlated with FIN after adjusting for the influence of age. LH and LH/FSH were not related to FIN or HOMA-IR after statistical correction for differences in BMI. The relevant analysis between hyperinsulinaemia and IR and metabolic profile showed that FIN and HOMA-IR were positively associated with fasting glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, Apo B, and the incidence of metabolic syndrome and were negatively associated with high-density lipoprotein. The predictive analysis between hyperinsulinaemia and IR with fertility showed that the levels of FIN and HOMA-IR were related to the fertility outcome (ovulation, pregnancy, conception or live birth) in patients with PCOS. After adjustments for age, total testosterone and free testosterone, increasing serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR were significantly associated with decreased cycle ovulation, conception, pregnancy and live birth rates.Hyperinsulinaemia and IR are associated with reproductive and metabolic disorders and can predict the fertility outcomes in PCOS patients.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",NA,22/06/2019,D016428;D016448;D016449;D013485,10.1111/cen.14050,NCT01573858,1,1,,

Initial ECG patterns included lead-specific ST-segment elevation (STE) or depression (STD), T-wave inversion (TWI), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), sinus tachycardia, and right bundle branch block as complete (cRBBB) or incomplete (iRBBB). We defined CD as respiratory failure, hypotension, dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest, escalated PE intervention, or death within 5 days. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for CD and abnlRV with univariate and full multivariate models in the presence of other variables.Of 1676 patients, 1629 (97.2%) had both ECG and GDE; 415/1676 (24.7%) had CD, and 529/1629 (32.4%) had abnlRV. AbnlRV had an OR for CD of 4.25 (3.35, 5.38). By univariable analysis, the absence of abnormal ECG patterns had OR for CD and abnlRV of 0.34 (0.26, 0.44; p < 0.001) and 0.24 (0.18, 0.31; p < 0.001), respectively. By multivariable analyses, one ECG pattern had a significant OR for CD: SVT 2.87 (1.66, 5.00). Significant ORS for abnlRV were: TWI V2-4 4.0 (2.64, 6.12), iRBBB 2.63 (1.59, 4.38), STE aVR 2.42 (1.58, 3.74), S1-Q3-T3 2.42 (1.70, 3.47), and sinus tachycardia 1.68 (1.14, 2.49).SVT was an independent predictor of CD. TWI V2-4 , iRBBB, STE aVR, sinus tachycardia, and S1-Q3-T3 were independent predictors of abnlRV.

Here, using data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative study that includes longitudinal and comprehensive evaluations of many clinical parameters, we examined the long-term effects of regular physical activity and exercise habits on the course of PD.In this retrospective, observational cohort study, we primarily used the multivariate linear mixed-effects models to analyze the interaction effects of their regular physical activity and moderate to vigorous exercise levels, measured with the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly questionnaire, on the progression of clinical parameters, after adjusting for age, sex, levodopa equivalent dose, and disease duration. We also calculated bootstrapping 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and conducted sensitivity analyses using the multiple imputation method and subgroup analyses using propensity score matching to match for all baseline background factors.Two hundred thirty-seven patients with early PD (median [interquartile range] age, 63.0 [56.0-70.0] years, male 69.2%, follow-up duration 5.0 [4.0-6.0] years) were included. Regular physical activity and moderate to vigorous exercise levels at baseline did not significantly affect the subsequent clinical progression of PD. However, average regular overall physical activity levels over time were significantly associated with slower deterioration of postural and gait stability (standardized fixed-effects coefficients of the interaction term [βinteraction] = -0.10 [95% CI -0.14 to -0.06]), activities of daily living (βinteraction = 0.08 [95% CI 0.04-0.12]), and processing speed (βinteraction = 0.05 [95% CI 0.03-0.08]) in patients with PD. Moderate to vigorous exercise levels were preferentially associated with slower decline of postural and gait stability (βinteraction = -0.09 [95% CI -0.13 to -0.05]), and work-related activity levels were primarily associated with slower deterioration of processing speed (βinteraction = 0.07 [95% CI 0.04-0.09]). Multiple imputation and propensity score matching confirmed the robustness of our results.In the long term, the maintenance of high regular physical activity levels and exercise habits was robustly associated with better clinical course of PD, with each type of physical activity having different effects.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01176565.This study provides Class II evidence that sustained increase in overall regular physical activity levels in patients with early PD was associated with slower decline of several clinical parameters.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

The objective of this study was to systematically review the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of these devices for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+).In accordance with our protocol (Prospero CRD42018104286), we searched Embase, Medline and the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials up to 9/2019. We included DTA studies, which investigated portable devices with moderate-to-high optical magnification (≥ 6×) for colposcopy, as described in the manual for Colposcopy and Treatment by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a histopathological reference standard. We used the QUADAS-2 tool to assess study quality. We examined results for sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, stratified by stages in the clinical pathway. We pooled estimates of test accuracy for the index test, used as an add-on to other tests, using a bivariate random-effect model.We screened 1737 references and assessed 239 full-text articles for eligibility.

Identifying the patients at risk of early mortality (within 24 hour of hospital arrival) is essential for triage. A bilateral Government Australia-India Trauma System Collaboration generated a trauma registry in the context of India, which yielded a cohort of trauma patients for systematic observation and interventions. The aim of this study was to determine the independent association of on-arrival vital signs and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) with 24-hour mortality among adult trauma patients admitted at four university public hospitals in urban India.We performed an analysis of a prospective multicentre observational study of trauma patients across four urban public university hospitals in India, between April 2016 and February 2018. The primary outcome was 24-hour in-hospital mortality. We used logistic regression to determine mutually independent associations of the vital signs and GCS with 24-hour mortality.A total of 7497 adult patients (18 years and above) were included. The 24-hour mortality was 1.9%. In univariable logistic regression, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and the vital signs systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) had statistically significant associations with 24-hour mortality. These relationships held in multivariable analysis with hypotension (SBP<90mm Hg), tachycardia (HR>100bpm) and bradycardia (HR<60bpm), hypoxia (SpO2<90%), Tachypnoea (RR>20brpm) and severe (3-8) and moderate (9-12) GCS having strong association with 24-hour mortality. Notably, the patients with missing values for SBP, HR and RR also demonstrated higher odds of 24-hour mortality. The Injury Severity Scores (ISS) did not corelate with 24-hour mortality.The routinely measured GCS and vital signs including SBP, HR, SpO2 and RR are independently associated with 24-hour in-hospital mortality in the context of university hospitals of urban India. These easily measured parameters in the emergency setting may help improve decision-making and guide further management in the trauma victims.

Peripheral tissue perfusion signs, simple and reliable markers of tissue hypoperfusion have never been extensively assessed during cardiogenic shock. Objectives: To assess the correlation of capillary refill time values with 90-day mortality in cardiogenic shock patients or the need for venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) support. Also to assess the correlation between capillary refill time and hemodynamic parameters. Methods: All consecutive patients with cardiogenic shock admitted to the intensive care unit of two tertiary teaching hospitals were included in a prospective observational study. Macro-hemodynamic parameters (such as heart rate, blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, and cardiac index) and peripheral tissue perfusion signs, such as capillary refill time on the index fingertip, mottling, and Pv-aCO2 (the difference between partial pressure of CO2 between venous and arterial blood) were recorded at inclusion (0 hour), 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours. The composite primary endpoint was the association between 90-day mortality or the need for VA-ECMO support. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 61 patients were included; at inclusion, simplified acute physiology score II was 64 (52-77) points. The primary endpoint was met by 42% of patients. Capillary refill time values were significantly higher at all time points in nonsurvivors or patients needing VA-ECMO support. In univariate analysis, capillary refill time > 3 seconds at inclusion was associated with 90-day all-cause mortality or VA-ECMO support (hazard ratio, 12.38; 95% confidence interval, 2.91-52.71). Capillary refill time at inclusion was poorly associated with macrocirculatory parameters but significantly correlated with microcirculatory parameters. Further, capillary refill time added incremental value to Cardshock score, with an AUC combination at 0.93. Conclusions: In patients with cardiogenic shock admitted to the ICU, our preliminary data suggest that a prolonged capillary refill time >3 seconds was associated with an early prediction of 90-day mortality or the need for VA-ECMO support.",NA,19/07/2022,D064888;D016448;D016428,10.1164/rccm.202204-0687OC,NA,1,1,,

Non-English-language articles were excluded.Observational and interventional studies deriving or validating an LGIB risk score for the prediction of a clinical outcome were included. Studies including patients younger than 16 years or limited to a specific patient population or a specific cause of bleeding were excluded. Two investigators independently screened the studies, and disagreements were resolved by consensus.Data were abstracted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline independently by 2 investigators and pooled using random-effects models.Summary diagnostic performance measures (sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]) determined a priori were calculated for each risk score and outcome combination.A total of 3268 citations were identified, of which 9 studies encompassing 12 independent cohorts and 4 risk scores (Oakland, Strate, NOBLADS [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, no diarrhea, no abdominal tenderness, blood pressure ≤100 mm Hg, antiplatelet drug use (nonaspirin), albumin <3.0 g/dL, disease score ≥2 (according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index), and syncope], and BLEED [ongoing bleeding, low systolic blood pressure, elevated prothrombin time, erratic mental status, and unstable comorbid disease]) were included in the meta-analysis. For the prediction of safe discharge, the AUROC for the Oakland score was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.88).

The interplay of several factors including the radiation wavelengths and the nanoparticle characteristics underlie the thermal outcome. However, a quantitative thermal analysis in in vivo models embedding nanoparticles and under different near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths is missing.We evaluate the thermal effects induced by different combinations of NIR laser wavelengths and gold nanorods (GNRs) in breast cancer tumor models in mice.Four laser wavelengths within the therapeutic window, i.e., 808, 940, 975, and 1064 nm were employed, and corresponding GNRs were intratumorally injected. The tissue thermal response was evaluated in terms of temperature profile and time constants, considering the step response of a first-order system as a model.The 808 nm and 1064 nm lasers experienced the highest temperature enhancements (>24%) in presence of GNRs compared to controls; conversely, 975 nm and 940 nm lasers showed high temperatures in controls due to significant tissue absorption and the lowest temperature difference with and without GNRs (temperature enhancement <10%). The presence of GNRs resulted in small time constants, thus quicker laser-induced thermal response (from 67 s to 33 s at 808 nm).The thermal responses of different GNR-laser wavelength combinations quantitatively validate the widespread usage of 808 nm laser for nanoparticle-assisted photothermal procedures.

Patients in the experimental group will be treated with ""Xing-Nao Kai-Qiao"" acupuncture therapy plus language training, and those in the control group will be treated with sham-acupoint (1 cun next to the acupoints) acupuncture therapy plus language training. All the patients will be given acupuncture and language training for 6 weeks, with a follow-up evaluation 6 weeks after the end of the treatment and 6 months after the onset time. The patients will mainly be evaluated using the Western Aphasia Battery and Chinese Functional Communication Profile, and the incidence of treatment-related adverse events at the 2nd, 4th, and 6th weeks of treatment will be recorded. The baseline characteristics of the patients will be summarized by group, the chi-squared test will be used to compare categorical variables, and repeated measures of analysis of variance or a linear mixed model will be applied to analyze the changes measured at different time points.The present study is designed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of traditional acupuncture therapy and language training in ischemic motor aphasia after stroke and explore the correlation between the treatment time and clinical effect of acupuncture. We hope our results will help doctors understand and utilize acupuncture combined with language training.ChiCTR ChiCTR1900026740 . Registered on 20 October 2019.© 2022.

It has been reported that levosimendan may facilitate VA-ECMO weaning and improve survival. The primary objective of this review was to examine the effect of levosimendan use on VA-ECMO weaning and mortality in critically ill patients on VA-ECMO.MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched. A pair of reviewers identified eligible clinical trials. Two reviewers extracted data and independently assessed the risk of bias. A random-effect model was used to combine data. The primary outcome was the success of weaning from VA-ECMO.Seven studies of observational design, including a total of 630 patients, were selected in the final analysis. The sample size ranged from ten-to-240 patients, with a mean age between 53 and 65 years, and more than half of them underwent cardiac surgeries. The VA-ECMO durations varied between four and 11.6 days. Overall, levosimendan use was significantly associated with successful weaning compared with control (odds ratio [OR] 2.89, 95% CI, 1.53-5.46; poverall effect = 0.001); I2 = 49%). For survival, six studies (n = 617) were included in the meta-analysis involving 326 patients in the levosimendan group and 291 in the comparator group. Pooled results showed a significantly higher survival rate in the levosimendan group (OR 0.46, 95% CI, 0.30-0.71; poverall effect = 0.0004; I2 = 20%).Levosimendan therapy was significantly associated with successful weaning and survival benefit in patients with cardiogenic or postcardiotomy shock needing VA-ECMO support for severe cardiocirculatory compromise. To date, there is limited literature and absence of evidence from randomized trials addressing the use of levosimendan in VA-ECMO weaning. This study may be considered a hypothesis-generating research for randomized controlled trials to confirm its findings.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need6,7. Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8+PD1+ T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8+PD1+ T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8+PD1+CXCR6+, TOX+, and TNF+ T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8+ T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8+ T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8+PD1+ T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment.","c(""26813"", ""Cancer Research UK"", ""United Kingdom"")|c(""UL1 TR001863"", ""NCATS NIH HHS"", ""United States"")|c(""P30 CA008748"", ""NCI NIH HHS"", ""United States"")|c(""R37 CA230636"", ""NCI NIH HHS"", ""United States"")|c(""Wellcome Trust"", ""United Kingdom"")|c(""P30 CA196521"", ""NCI NIH HHS"", ""United States"")",26/03/2021,D016428;D013485,10.1038/s41586-021-03362-0,NA,1,1,,

As a fall is associated with a high risk of functional decline and further falls and many falls do not receive medical attention, the ED is ideal to initiate secondary prevention, an opportunity generally not taken. Data on trajectories to identify patients, who would profit the most form early intervention and to examine the impact of a fall event, are lacking. To tailor interventions to the individual's needs and preferences, and to address the whole scope of fall risks, we developed this longitudinal study using an extensive assessment battery including dynamic balance and aerobic fitness, but also sensor-based data. Additionally, participative research will contribute valuable qualitative data, and machine learning will be used to identify trips, slips, and falls in sensor data during daily life.This is a mixed-methods study consisting of four parts: (1) an observational prospective study, (2) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to explore whether a diagnostic to measure reactive dynamic balance influences fall risk, (3) machine learning approaches and (4) a qualitative study to explore patients' and their caregivers' views. We will target a sample size of 450 adults of 60 years and older, who presented to the ED of the Klinikum Oldenburg after a fall and are not hospitalized. The participants will be followed up over 24 months (within four weeks after the ED, after 6, 12 and 24 months). We will assess functional abilities, fall risk factors, participation, quality of life, falls incidence, and physical activity using validated instruments, including sensor-data. Additionally, two thirds of the patients will undergo intensive testing in the gait laboratory and 72 participants will partake in focus group interviews.The results of the SeFallED study will be used to identify risk factors with high predictive value for functional outcome after a sentinel fall. This will help to (1) establish a protocol adapted to the situation in the ED to identify patients at risk and (2) to initiate an appropriate care pathway, which will be developed based on the results of this study.DRKS (Deutsches Register für klinische Studien, DRKS00025949 ).

Nearly half the patients (48%) completing 1 L received 2 L therapy. Among these patients, there was no consistent 2 L treatment of choice. Overall median time to treatment discontinuation was 3.5 months from 1 L treatment initiation, and median overall treatment-free interval was 2.1 months from 1 L discontinuation. Besides elevated serum creatinine, abnormal BMI indicated a directional trend for lower likelihood of receiving 2 L. Other predictors may include no prior bevacizumab, worse ECOG, and earlier disease prevention.>50% of the patients who initiated 1 L treatment did not receive 2 L therapy, highlighting the need for novel and effective treatment options.

Medical history, clinical data and laboratory data were collected at enrolment and during 90-day follow-up, with particular attention given to the following characteristics of precipitants: induction of organ dysfunction or failure, systemic inflammation, chronology, intensity, and relationship to outcome.Among various clinical events, 4 distinct events were precipitants consistently related to AD: proven bacterial infections, severe alcoholic hepatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding with shock and toxic encephalopathy. Among patients with precipitants in the AD-No ACLF cohort and the AD-ACLF cohort (38% and 71%, respectively), almost all (96% and 97%, respectively) showed proven bacterial infection and severe alcoholic hepatitis, either alone or in combination with other events. Survival was similar in patients with proven bacterial infections or severe alcoholic hepatitis in both AD phenotypes. The number of precipitants was associated with significantly increased 90-day mortality and was paralleled by increasing levels of surrogates for systemic inflammation. Importantly, adequate first-line antibiotic treatment of proven bacterial infections was associated with a lower ACLF development rate and lower 90-day mortality.This study identified precipitants that are significantly associated with a distinct clinical course and prognosis in patients with AD.

NETs are composed of neutrophil-derived circulating free DNA (cf-DNA) and neutrophil cytoplasm-derived proteins such as proteases. In this study, we analyzed the putative diagnostic value of synovial cf-DNA/NETs for identification of septic arthritis. Forty-two patients with a joint effusion who had undergone arthrocentesis were included. From synovial fluid, cf-DNA/NETs (j-cf-DNA) levels were directly quantified. Diagnostic value of j-cf-DNA was compared with white blood cells (WBC), synovial white blood cells (j-WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), j-IL-6, j-TNF alpha, j-IL-1 beta, and myeloperoxidase (j-MPO). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, as well as ROC-curves for each parameter were calculated. Synovial fluid cf-DNA/NETs values from patients with septic arthritis (3,286 +/- 386 ng/ml, n = 9) were significantly increased compared to patients with noninfectious joint inflammation (1,040 +/- 208 ng/ml, n = 17) or osteoarthritis (278 +/- 34 ng/ml, n = 16, p < 0.01). In conjunction with j-cf-DNA, j-IL-6 and j-IL-1 beta were significantly elevated (p < 0.01), but WBC, CRP, and j-WBC were not.

However, ligand RNA assays have not been adopted into routine practice due to issues with analytic precision and practicality. We investigated whether AREG/EREG IHC could predict benefit from the anti-EGFR agent panitumumab.Artificial intelligence algorithms were developed to assess AREG/EREG IHC in 274 patients from the PICCOLO trial of irinotecan with or without panitumumab (Ir vs. IrPan) in RAS wild-type mCRC. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were RECIST response rate (RR) and overall survival (OS). Models were repeated adjusting separately for BRAF mutation status and primary tumor location (PTL).High ligand expression was associated with significant PFS benefit from IrPan compared with Ir [8.0 vs. 3.2 months; HR, 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-0.79; P = 0.001]; whereas low ligand expression was not (3.4 vs. 4.4 months; HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74-1.49; P = 0.78). The ligand-treatment interaction was significant (P interaction = 0.02) and remained significant after adjustment for BRAF-mutation status and PTL.

The use of HFNC involved a minimum reduction (5%) in admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in our hospital. Our main aim was to evaluate its safety and effectiveness as respiratory support for patients with bronchiolitis in a pediatric general ward. A secondary goal was to compare the admissions to PICU and the invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) rate of patients treated with HFNC and those treated with HFNC/b-CPAP during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 epidemic seasons, respectively. Two prospective single-centre observational studies were performed. For the main aim, a cohort study (CS1) was carried out from 1st of November 2019 to 15th of January 2020. Inclusion criteria were children aged up to 3 months with bronchiolitis treated with b-CPAP support when HFNC failed. Epidemiological and clinical parameters were collected before and 60 min after the onset of CPAP and compared between the responder (R) and non-responders (NR) groups. NR was the group that required PICU admission. One hundred fifty-eight patients were admitted to the ward with bronchiolitis and HFNC. Fifty-seven out of one hundred fifty-eight required b-CPAP. No adverse events were observed. Thirty-two out of fifty-seven remained in the general ward (R-group), and 25/57 were admitted to PICU (NR-group). There were statistically significant differences in respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) between both groups before and after the initiation of b-CPAP, but the multivariable models showed that the main differences were observed after 60 min of therapy (lower HR, RR, BROSJOD score and FiO2 in the R-group). For the secondary aim, another cohort study (CS2) was performed comparing data from a pre-b-CPAP bronchiolitis season (1st of November 2018 to 15th January 2019) and the b-CPAP season (2019-2020). Inclusion criteria in pre-b-CPAP season were children aged up to 3 months admitted to the same general ward with moderate-severe bronchiolitis and with HFNC support. Admissions to PICU during the CPAP season were significantly reduced, without entailing an increase in the rate of IMV.The implementation of b-CPAP for patients with bronchiolitis in a pediatric ward, in whom HFNC fails, is safe and effective and results in a reduction in PICU admissions.• Bronchiolitis is one of the most frequent respiratory infections in children and one of the leading causes of hospitalization in infants. • Several studies suggest that the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for acute bronchiolitis can be more effective than the high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). CPAP is a non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy used in patients admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with progressive moderate-severe bronchiolitis. There is little experience in the literature on the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for acute bronchiolitis in a general ward.• CPAP could be safely and effectively used as respiratory support in young infants with moderate-severe bronchiolitis in a general ward and it reduced the rate of patients who required PICU admission. • Patients' heart and respiratory rate and their FiO2 needs in the first 60 minutes may help to decide whether or not to continue the CPAP therapy in a general ward.© 2022.

A decision support tool (Collaboration for the Diagnosis and Evaluation of Heart Failure (CoDE-HF)) that combines NT-proBNP with clinical variables to report the probability of acute heart failure for an individual patient was developed and validated.Adjudicated diagnosis of acute heart failure.Overall, 43.9% (4549/10 369) of patients had an adjudicated diagnosis of acute heart failure (73.3% (2286/3119) and 29.0% (1802/6208) in those with and without previous heart failure, respectively). The negative predictive value of the guideline recommended rule-out threshold of 300 pg/mL was 94.6% (95% confidence interval 91.9% to 96.4%); despite use of age specific rule-in thresholds, the positive predictive value varied at 61.0% (55.3% to 66.4%), 73.5% (62.3% to 82.3%), and 80.2% (70.9% to 87.1%), in patients aged <50 years, 50-75 years, and >75 years, respectively. Performance varied in most subgroups, particularly patients with obesity, renal impairment, or previous heart failure. CoDE-HF was well calibrated, with excellent discrimination in patients with and without previous heart failure (area under the receiver operator curve 0.846 (0.830 to 0.862) and 0.925 (0.919 to 0.932) and Brier scores of 0.130 and 0.099, respectively). In patients without previous heart failure, the diagnostic performance was consistent across all subgroups, with 40.3% (2502/6208) identified at low probability (negative predictive value of 98.6%, 97.8% to 99.1%) and 28.0% (1737/6208) at high probability (positive predictive value of 75.0%, 65.7% to 82.5%) of having acute heart failure.In an international, collaborative evaluation of the diagnostic performance of NT-proBNP, guideline recommended thresholds to diagnose acute heart failure varied substantially in important patient subgroups.

We first aimed to validate the BEST-J score at four hospitals not specialized in performing ESD and then aimed to identify other risk factors for post-ESD bleeding.We evaluated the incidence of post-ESD bleeding in 791 cases of early gastric cancer (EGC) between October 2013 and December 2020 as a retrospective, multi-center observational study conducted at four hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression models to examine the effect of independent variables on post-ESD bleeding firstly included ten possible factors raised by the BEST-J score and secondly included statistically significant (p < 0.01) in univariate analysis. The prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic analysis and the areas under the curve (AUC).The incidence of post-ESD bleeding was 4.8% (38/791, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4-6.5%). On multivariate analysis, the risk factors were P2Y12 receptor antagonist (odds ratio [OR]: 5.870, 95% CI 1.624-21.219), warfarin (8.382, 1.658-42.322), direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (8.980, 1.603-50.322), and tumor location in lower third of stomach (2.151, 1.012-4.571), respectively. When we categorized cases into low-risk by BEST-J score, intermediate-risk, high-risk, and very high-risk groups, the bleeding rates were 2.8%, 7.3%, 12.8%, and 19.0%, respectively. The AUC for our cohort was 0.713 (95% CI 0.625-0.802) for the BEST-J score. In the multivariate analysis in our cohort, the risks were age, body mass index, P2Y12 receptor antagonist, warfarin, DOAC, respectively.The BEST-J score is equally accurate in risk stratification of patients with EGC for post-ESD bleeding at non-specialized facilities for ESD as in specialized hospitals.

This study aimed to determine the impact of cardiac rehabilitation on microRNA-423-5p in hypertensive patients with heart failure with a moderately reduced ejection fraction.Sixty hypertensive patients with heart failure with a moderately reduced ejec-tion fraction were randomly divided into cardiac rehabilitation group and positive control group with 30 cases per group, while 30 hypertensive patients without heart failure were recruited as negative control group. The cardiac rehabilitation group and positive control group were treated with 1-month cardiac rehabilitation combined with the routine treat-ment and routine treatment only, respectively. The New York Heart Association classi-fication, 6-minute walking test, and color Doppler echocardiography were adopted to detect cardiac function. Meanwhile, the expression of microRNA-423-5p and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was determined via Real-Time Fluorescence Quantitative PCR and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The diagnostic potential of microR- 423-5p and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was assessed by ROC curve analy- sis and multivariate linear regression model.Patients in cardiac rehabilitation group displayed significantly lower expression of microR-423-5p and better results of New York Heart Association classification, 6-min-ute walking test, and color Doppler echocardiography than those in positive controlgroup (P < .05).

These data indicate that a myriad of people may be affected by pulmonary sequelae of the infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate pulmonary sequelae in patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia according to severity 1 year after hospital discharge.COVID-FIBROTIC is a multicenter prospective observational cohort study for admitted patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. Pulmonary functional outcomes and chest computed tomography sequelae were analyzed 12 months after hospital discharge and we classified patients into three groups according to severity. A post hoc analysis model was designed to establish how functional test changed between groups and over time. A multivariable logistic regression model was created to study prognostic factors for lung diffusion impairment and radiological fibrotic-like changes at 12 months.Among 488 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 284 patients had completed the entire evaluation at 12 months. Median age was 60.5 ± 11.9 and 55.3% were men. We found between-group differences in male sex, length of hospital stay, radiological involvement and inflammatory laboratory parameters. The functional evaluation of pulmonary sequelae showed that severe patients had statistically worse levels of lung diffusion at 2 months but no between group differences were found in subsequent controls. At 12-month follow up, however, we found impaired lung diffusion in 39.8% unrelated to severity. Radiological fibrotic-like changes at 12 months were reported in 22.7% of patients (102/448), only associated with radiological involvement at admission (OR: 1.55, 95% CI 1.06-2.38; p = 0.02) and LDH (OR: 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-0.99; p = 0.046).Our data suggest that a significant percentage of individuals would develop pulmonary sequelae after COVID 19 pneumonia, regardless of severity of the acute process.

Pooling data from seven studies incorporating 842 cases identifies two genomic locations associated with time from diagnosis to treatment, including 10q26.13 (rs736456, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.47-2.15; P = 2.71 × 10-9) and 6p (rs3778076, HR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.55-2.55; P = 5.08 × 10-8), which are particularly powerful prognostic markers in patients with early stage CLL otherwise characterized by low-risk features. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis identifies putative functional genes implicated in modulating B-cell receptor or innate immune responses, key pathways in CLL pathogenesis. In this work we identify rs736456 and rs3778076 as prognostic in CLL, demonstrating that disease progression is determined by constitutional genetic variation as well as known somatic drivers.","c(""MC_U132670597"", ""Medical Research Council"", ""United Kingdom"")|c(""C2115/A21421"", ""Cancer Research UK"", ""United Kingdom"")|c(""Department of Health"", ""United Kingdom"")",30/01/2021,D016428;D016448;D013485,10.1038/s41467-020-20822-9,NA,1,1,,

Enrolled patients underwent anatomical pulmonary resection including lobectomy, bilobectomy, pneumonectomy, left upper trisegmentectomy or lingular segmentectomy. Postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed in the early period after the pulmonary resection to evaluate the incidence of PVST. Furthermore, univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with PVST using a logistic regression model.The status of PVST based on postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans was prospectively evaluated for 1040 patients. Postoperative computed tomography evaluation was performed for 3 (range: 1-84) days on average after the pulmonary resection. PVST was found in 127 (12.2%) patients with left-sided (23.3%) predominance compared to the right side (4.9%) (P < 0.001). Furthermore, left upper lobectomy was the most frequent operative procedure (30.8%). Multivariable analyses demonstrated that left upper lobectomy (P = 0.001) and left-sided pulmonary resection (P < 0.001) were independent significant predictors of PVST. Cerebral infarction was observed in 9 (0.87%) patients during this period and included 6 (1.46%) in whom it developed after the operation was performed on the left side. Especially in the early postoperative phase, left pulmonary resection was significantly associated with the incidence of cerebral infarction (0.16% vs 1.21%; P = 0.028).PVST is an early postoperative event that is frequently observed in patients undergoing left anatomical pulmonary resection, especially a left upper lobectomy.16-205, Clinical trial registry: UMIN000027118.© The Author(s) 2021.

The term ACS refers to a spectrum of acute life-threatening disorders that includes: unstable angina (UA), non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The pathophysiology is similar: coronary atherosclerosis plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation. Such plaques usually are lesions with <50% stenosis severity prior to ACS, but are lipid-rich soft plaques (vulnerable plaques). The clinical presentation depends on the degree of partial (UA/NSTEMI) or complete lumen obstruction of the culprit coronary artery (STEMI). This article reviews the UA/NSTEMI ACS, since these two entities are closely related and usually, it is not possible to distinguish them upon presentation at the emergency department (ED). It presents the latest advancement on the pathophysiology, clinical presentations, diagnosis, risk stratification and management. It emphasizes on the selection of the optimal management approach which includes early invasive versus initial conservative strategies. Besides, it discusses the different approaches being used in the light of the information provided by the latest clinical trials. Although, at the present time, the optimal management approach remains unsettled, ACSs are usually managed using an early invasive strategy in tertiary care hospitals in the USA. The application of clinical practice guidelines developed by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) has confirmed definite improvement of patient care. Part of the information presented in this article, particularly in its management, is based on these guidelines (3). Evidence base scientific data insists upon using aggressive medical therapy (statins, anti-platelets, beta blockers [BBs], angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-Is], and control of coronary risk factors) as well as mechanical reperfusion, whether by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or by coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).

Recently, sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) scoring was developed as a new criterion for coagulopathy-associated sepsis. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the SIC score for predicting the prognosis of septic shock. We analyzed data from a multicenter observational study conducted from 2011 to 2013. We grouped the participants into those who did and did not use vasopressors, and compared the in-hospital mortality rates of SIC and non-SIC patients. Patients who needed vasopressors were considered to have septic shock. We performed survival analysis adjusted by factors independently associated with mortality. SIC developed in 66.4% of patients who used vasopressors and 42.2% of patients who did not. The in-hospital mortality difference between the SIC and non-SIC groups was statistically significant in those who needed vasopressors (35.8% vs 27.9%, p < 0.01). Cox regression analysis indicated that SIC was significantly correlated with mortality risk in patients who used vasopressors (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.70; p < 0.01), but not in those who did not (HR 1.38; 95% CI 0.81-2.34; p = 0.23).

This study investigated the accuracy and clinical utility of the simplified Edinburgh CT criteria to identify underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).This external validation analyzed 210 consecutive patients with lobar ICH and available CT and MRI studies from a prospective single-center observational cohort study (2006-2015, Longitudinal Cohort Study on ICH Care [UKER-ICH,] NCT03183167). We investigated the interrater variability and diagnostic accuracy of the simplified Edinburgh CT-based criteria for identification of ICH associated with probable CAA according to MRI-based modified Boston criteria as a reference standard. We evaluated the utility of the simplified Edinburgh criteria by decision curve analysis, comparing the theoretical clinical net benefit (weighted benefit-harm at varying threshold probabilities) of the high-risk category (finger-like projections and subarachnoid hemorrhage) for ruling in and the low-risk category (neither finger-like projections nor subarachnoid hemorrhage) for ruling out with the assumptions of no or all patients having CAA (default strategies).Of 210 patients, 70 (33.3%) had high risk, 67 (31.9%) had medium risk, and 73 (34.8%) had low risk for CAA-associated ICH according to simplified Edinburgh CT criteria, showing moderate interrater variability. Discrimination was good (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.81) without evidence of poor calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow, p = 0.54) for validation of MRI-based diagnosis of probable CAA (n = 94 of 210, 44.8%).

The search was limited by the following key words: quality of life, survival, and colorectal cancer. We then performed a second search limited to studies of randomized and Phase III design in mCRC to identify studies that used QOL assessments as their primary end points. A manual search was also performed to include additional studies of potential relevance.There is increasing evidence to support that symptom control and QOL measures are predictors of survival in treatment-refractory mCRC and can serve as an alternative but equally as important end point to survival in this population. A recent large, randomized Phase III trial using a composite primary end point of lean body mass, pain, anorexia, and fatigue reported the feasibility in evaluating benefit in mCRC beyond conventional clinical trial end points.Future studies in treatment-refractory mCRC may be better served by evaluating improvement in symptom control and QOL, which may otherwise serve as the best predictor of survival in last-line treatment settings.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

They reported on outcomes of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, final A1C among patients with gestational diabetes mellitus, and postpartum hemorrhage. None reported on racial disparities for minoritized populations. Among all reported maternal outcomes, results were mixed, providing inconclusive evidence.Outcomes from group prenatal care focus more on neonatal outcomes than maternal outcomes. More studies are needed with stronger designs. Given pervasive racial disparities in U.S. maternal mortality, future studies should assess how group prenatal care participation may contribute to fewer experiences of racial discrimination and implicit bias for Black women in maternity care.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Deep learning systems with real-time computer-aided polyp detection (CADe) showed high accuracy in artificial settings, and preliminary randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported favorable outcomes in the clinical setting. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize available RCTs on the performance of CADe systems in colorectal neoplasia detection.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases until March 2020 for RCTs reporting diagnostic accuracy of CADe systems in the detection of colorectal neoplasia. The primary outcome was pooled adenoma detection rate (ADR), and secondary outcomes were adenoma per colonoscopy (APC) according to size, morphology, and location; advanced APC; polyp detection rate; polyps per colonoscopy; and sessile serrated lesions per colonoscopy. We calculated risk ratios (RRs), performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias.Overall, 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) were included in the final analysis. Pooled ADR was significantly higher in the CADe group than in the control group (791/2163 [36.6%] vs 558/2191 [25.2%]; RR, 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.62; P < .01; I2 = 42%). APC was also higher in the CADe group compared with control (1249/2163 [.58] vs 779/2191 [.36]; RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.53-1.89; P < .01; I2 = 33%). APC was higher for ≤5-mm (RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.48-1.84), 6- to 9-mm (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.75), and ≥10-mm adenomas (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.04-2.06) and for proximal (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.34-1.88), distal (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.50-1.88), flat (RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.47-2.15), and polypoid morphology (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.40-1.68). Regarding histology, CADe resulted in a higher sessile serrated lesion per colonoscopy (RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.14-2.02), whereas a nonsignificant trend for advanced ADR was found (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, .74-2.47; P = .33; I2 = 69%). Level of evidence for RCTs was graded as moderate.According to available evidence, the incorporation of artificial intelligence as aid for detection of colorectal neoplasia results in a significant increase in the detection of colorectal neoplasia, and such effect is independent from main adenoma characteristics.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

This pilot and feasibility trial assessed thoracolumbar shear strain in persons with chronic low back pain following spinal manipulation and over an 8-week course of multimodal chiropractic care.Adults self-reporting chronic low back pain ≥ 1 year participated between September 2019 and April 2021 in a trial using ultrasound imaging to measure thoracolumbar shear strain. Ultrasound imaging occurred 2-3 cm lateral to L2-3 while participants relaxed prone on an automated table moving the lower extremities downward 15 degrees, for 5 cycles at 0.5 Hz. Pain intensity on an 11-point numerical rating scale, disability, pain interference, and global improvement were also collected. Participants received 8-weeks of twice-weekly chiropractic care including spinal manipulation, education, exercise, self-management advice and myofascial therapies. Shear strain was computed using 2 methods. The highest shear strain from movement cycles 2, 3, or 4 was averaged over right and left sides for each participant. Alternately, the highest shear strain from movement cycle 3 was used. All data were analyzed over time using mixed-effects models. Estimated mean changes are reported.Of 20 participants completing 8-weeks of chiropractic care (female n = 11), mean (SD) age was 41 years (12.6); mean BMI was 28.5 (6.2). All clinical outcomes improved at 8-weeks. Mean (95% confidence interval) pain intensity decreased 2.7 points (- 4.1 to - 1.4) for females and 2.1 points (- 3.7 to 0.4) for males. Mean Roland-Morris disability score decreased by 5 points (- 7.2 to - 2.8) for females, 2.3 points (- 4.9 to 0.2) for males. Mean PROMIS pain interference T-score decreased by 8.7 points (- 11.8 to - 5.5) for females, 5.6 points (- 9.5 to - 1.6) for males. Mean shear strain at 8-weeks increased in females 5.4% (- 9.9 to 20.8) or 15% (- 0.5 to 30.6), decreasing in males 6.0% (- 24.2 to 12.2) or 2% (- 21.0 to 16.8) depending on computational method.Spinal manipulation does not likely disrupt adhesions or relax paraspinal muscles enough to immediately affect shear strain. Clinical outcomes improved in both groups, however, shear strain only increased in females following 8-weeks of multimodal chiropractic care.

Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by comparing the App-diagnoses with the final discharge diagnoses. Timing of diagnosis and time to treatment were correlated with complications, overall survival, and length of hospital stay.In this prospective, double-blinded study, 450 patients were enrolled and followed up until day 90. Ada suggested the final discharge diagnosis in 52.0% (95% CI [0.47, 0.57]) of patients compared with the classic doctor-patient interaction, which was significantly superior with 80.9% (95% CI [0.77, 0.84], P <0.001). However, when diagnostic accuracy of both were assessed together, Ada significantly increased the accuracy rate (87.3%, P <0.001), when compared with the ER physician alone. Patients with an early time point of diagnosis and rapid treatment allocation exhibited significantly reduced complications ( P< 0.001) and length of hospital stay ( P< 0.001).Currently, the classic patient-physician interaction is superior to an AI-based diagnostic tool applied by patients. However, AI tools have the potential to additionally benefit the diagnostic efficacy of clinicians and improve quality of care.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This study aimed to provide an updated estimation of the prevalence of NASH fibrosis in Spain.This was an observational, retrospective, cross-sectional, population-based study with merged data from two Spanish datasets: a large (N = 12 246) population-based cohort (ETHON), including transient elastography (TE) data, and a contemporary multi-centric biopsy-proven NASH cohort with paired TE data from tertiary centres (N = 501). Prevalence for each NASH fibrosis stage was estimated by crossing TE data from ETHON dataset with histology data from the biopsy-proven cohort.From the patients with valid TE in ETHON dataset (N = 11 440), 5.61% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.53-11.97) had a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥ 8 kPa. The proportion attributable to NAFLD (using clinical variables and Controlled Attenuation Parameter) was 57.3% and thus, the estimated prevalence of population with LSM ≥ 8 kPa because of NAFLD was 3.21% (95% CI 1.13-8.75). In the biopsy-proven NASH cohort, 389 patients had LSM ≥ 8 kPa. Among these, 37% did not have significant fibrosis (F2-4). The estimated prevalence of NASH F2-3 and cirrhosis in Spain's adult population were 1.33% (95% CI 0.29-5.98) and 0.70% (95% CI 0.10-4.95) respectively.These estimations provide an accurate picture of the current prevalence of NASH-related fibrosis in Spain and can serve as reference point for dimensioning the therapeutic efforts that will be required as NASH therapies become available.© 2022 The Authors.

The NHS recommends weight loss advice by general practitioners and/or a referral to a practice nurse. Although this is helpful for some, more effective approaches that can be disseminated economically on a large scale are needed.To assess whether or not a task-based weight management programme [Weight Action Programme (WAP)] has better long-term effects than a 'best practice' intervention provided in primary care by practice nurses.Randomised controlled trial with cost-effectiveness analysis.General practices in east London, UK.Three hundred and thirty adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2 or a BMI of ≥ 28 kg/m2 plus comorbidities were recruited from local general practices and via media publicity. Those who had a BMI of > 45 kg/m2, had lost > 5% of their body weight in the previous 6 months, were currently pregnant or taking psychiatric medications were excluded. Participants were randomised (2 : 1) to the WAP or nurse arms.The WAP intervention was delivered in eight weekly group sessions that combined dietary and physical activity, advice and self-monitoring in a group-oriented intervention. The initial course was followed by 10 monthly group maintenance sessions open to all participants in this study arm. The practice nurse intervention (best usual care) consisted of four one-to-one sessions delivered over 8 weeks, and included standard advice on diet and physical activity based on NHS 'Change4Life' materials and motivational support.The primary outcome measure was weight change at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included change in BMI, waist circumference and blood pressure, and proportion of participants losing at least 5% and 10% of baseline body weight. Staff collecting measurements at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups were blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle, and included all participants with at least one recorded outcome at either 1, 2, 6 or 12 months. The analysis employed a mixed-effects linear regression model, adjusted for baseline weight, age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status and general practice. The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels questionnaire was completed and used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) within the cost-effectiveness analysis.There were 330 participants (WAP arm, n = 221; nurse arm, n = 109; 72% women). A total of 291 (88%) participants (WAP arm, n = 194; nurse arm, n = 97) were included in the main analysis for the primary outcome. Weight loss at 12 months was greater in the WAP arm than in the nurse intervention arm [-4.2 kg vs. -2.3 kg; difference -1.9 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.7 to -0.1 kg; p = 0.04]. Participants in the WAP arm were more likely than participants in the nurse arm to have lost at least 5% of their baseline body weight at 12 months (41% vs. 27%; odds ratio 14.61, 95% CI 2.32 to 91.96; p = 0.004). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for WAP over and above the nurse arm is £7742 per QALY.A WAP delivered in general practice better promotes weight loss over 12 months than a best usual practice nurse-led weight loss programme.The trial recruited mostly women.

A comprehensive report on the incidence, clinical characteristics, and evolving management of sepsis is important. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with severe sepsis in Japan.This is a cohort study of the Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis, and Trauma (FORECAST) study, which was a multicenter, prospective cohort study conducted at 59 intensive care units (ICUs) from January 2016 to March 2017. We included adult patients with severe sepsis based on the sepsis-2 criteria.In total, 1184 patients (median age 73 years, interquartile range (IQR) 64-81) with severe sepsis were admitted to the ICU during the study period. The most common comorbidity was diabetes mellitus (23%). Moreover, approximately 63% of patients had septic shock. The median Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 9 (IQR 6-11). The most common site of infection was the lung (31%). Approximately 54% of the participants had positive blood cultures. The compliance rates for the entire 3-h bundle, measurement of central venous pressure, and assessment of central venous oxygen saturation were 64%, 26%, and 7%, respectively. A multilevel logistic regression model showed that closed ICUs and non-university hospitals were more compliant with the entire 3-h bundle. The in-hospital mortality rate of patients with severe sepsis was 23% (21-26%). Older age, multiple comorbidities, suspected site of infection, and increasing SOFA scores correlated with in-hospital mortality, based on the generalized estimating equation model. The length of hospital stay was 24 (12-46) days. Approximately 37% of the patients were discharged home after recovery.Our prospective study showed that sepsis management in Japan was characterized by a high compliance rate for the 3-h bundle and low compliance rate for central venous catheter measurements. The in-hospital mortality rate in Japan was comparable to that of other developed countries.

There is, however, no robust evidence on costs of social care provided for community-dwelling older people living with frailty in their own homes. The main objective of this study was to examine the relationship between community-dwelling older people living with frailty, defined using the cumulative deficit model, and annual formal social care costs for the 2012-2018 period. A secondary objective was to estimate formal social care spending for every 1% reduction in the number of older people who develop frailty over 1 year. Secondary analysis of prospective cohort data from two large nationally representative community-based cohort studies in England was performed. Respondents aged ≥75 were used in the main analysis and respondents aged 65-74 in sensitivity testing. We used regression tree modelling for formal social care cost analysis including frailty, age, gender, age at completing education and living with partner as key covariates. We employed a minimum node size stopping criteria to limit tree complexity and overfitting and applied 'bootstrap aggregating' to improve robustness. We assessed the impact of an intervention for every 1% decrease in the number of individuals who become frail over 1 year in England. Results show that frailty is the strongest predictor of formal social care costs. Mean social care costs for people who are not frail are £321, compared with £2,895 for individuals with frailty. For every 1% of nonfrail people not transitioning to frailty savings of £4.4 million in annual expenditures on formal social care in England are expected, not including expenditure on care homes. Given considerably higher costs for individuals classed as frail compared to nonfrail, a successful intervention avoiding or postponing the onset of frailty has the potential to considerably reduce social care costs.© 2021 The Authors.

We included case-control and cohort studies or randomized trials reporting the associations of individual thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics use with skin cancers. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma were analysed separately. A random-effects model meta-analysis was conducted for pooled odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) for skin cancers related to individual thiazide use.We included 15, 5, and 5 case-control or cohort studies reporting the risk for skin cancers associated with hydrochlorothiazide, bendroflumethiazide, and indapamide use, respectively, with 17,848,313 participants. The meta-analysis showed associations of hydrochlorothiazide use with increased risk of NMSC (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08-1.24; HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.54), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06-1.65; HR 1.61, 95% CI 0.97-2.67), and melanoma (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93-1.14). The increased risks for SCC were associated with high cumulative doses of hydrochlorothiazide (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.43-4.57; HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00-1.45). Hydrochlorothiazide use was associated with different subtypes of melanoma including superficial spreading (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.33), nodular (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.08-1.39), and lentigo maligna melanoma (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08-1.65). Various cumulative doses of hydrochlorothiazide were associated with increased odds for melanoma. However, the associations of hydrochlorothiazide use with increased risk of NMSC and melanoma only appeared in non-Asian countries. No meaningful increase in the risk for skin cancers was associated with bendroflumethiazide and indapamide.Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk for NMSC (especially SCC) and melanoma in non-Asian countries, whereas bendroflumethiazide and indapamide are not associated with a meaningful risk for skin cancers.

We aimed at investigating the performance of composite respiratory indexes as possible predictors of CPAP failure in ARF due to COVID-19.This was a multicenter, prospective, observational, and cohort study conducted in the respiratory units of three University hospitals in Milan and in a secondary care hospital in Codogno (Italy), on consecutive adult patients with ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia that underwent CPAP between March 2020 and March 2021. ETI transfer to the intensive care unit or death is defined CPAP failure. Predictors of CPAP failure were assessed before T0 and 1 hour after T1 CPAP initiation and included mROX index (ratio of PaO2/FiO2 to respiratory rate), alveolar-to-arterial (A-a) O2 gradient, and the HACOR (heart rate, acidosis, consciousness, oxygenation, and respiratory rate) score.Three hundred and fifty four patients (mean age 64 years, 73% males) were included in the study; 136 (38.4%) satisfied criteria for CPAP failure. A-a O2 gradient, mROX, and HACOR scores were worse in patients who failed CPAP, both at T0 and T1 (p < 0.001 for all parameters).

Patients were included if they had regular clinical follow-up and at least 2 brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans suitable for volumetric analysis. Data were analyzed between January 2020 and March 2021.According to the clinical evolution during the entire observation, patients were classified as those presenting (1) relapse activity only, (2) PIRA episodes only, (3) mixed activity, or (4) clinical stability.Mean difference in annual percentage change (MD-APC) in brain volume/cortical thickness between groups, calculated after propensity score matching. Brain atrophy rates, and their association with the variables of interest, were explored with linear mixed-effect models.Included were 1904 brain MRI scans from 516 patients with RMS (67.4% female; mean [SD] age, 41.4 [11.1] years; median [IQR] Expanded Disability Status Scale score, 2.0 [1.5-3.0]). Scans with insufficient quality were excluded (n = 19). Radiological inflammatory activity was associated with increased atrophy rates in several brain compartments, while an increased annualized relapse rate was linked to accelerated deep gray matter (GM) volume loss. When compared with clinically stable patients, patients with PIRA had an increased rate of brain volume loss (MD-APC, -0.36; 95% CI, -0.60 to -0.12; P = .02), mainly driven by GM loss in the cerebral cortex. Patients who were relapsing presented increased whole brain atrophy (MD-APC, -0.18; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.02; P = .04) with respect to clinically stable patients, with accelerated GM loss in both cerebral cortex and deep GM. No differences in brain atrophy rates were measured between patients with PIRA and those presenting relapse activity.Our study shows that patients with RMS and PIRA exhibit accelerated brain atrophy, especially in the cerebral cortex. These results point to the need to recognize the insidious manifestations of PIRA in clinical practice and to further evaluate treatment strategies for patients with PIRA in clinical trials.",NA,17/05/2022,D016428;D064888;D013485,10.1001/jamaneurol.2022.1025,NA,1,1,,

However, it is not clear whether the protein also plays similar roles in breast cancer. Here, the expression of DCLK1 was analyzed in a large cohort of invasive breast cancers (IBC) by immunohistochemistry. DCKL1 was associated with favorable clinico-pathologic features, namely lower histologic grade, absence of lymphovascular invasion, fibrotic focus, necrosis and lower pN stage (p≤0.045). Additionally, independent significant correlations were found with estrogen receptor and neuroendocrine markers (p ≤0.019), implicating its relationship with IBC with neuroendocrine differentiation (IBC-NED). In the current cohort, IBC-NED showed worse outcome than luminal cancers without NED (hazard ratio=1.756, p=0.041). Interestingly, within the IBC-NED group, DCLK1 was found to be a good prognostic factor (hazard ratio =0.288, p=0.011). These findings were in contrast to those in gastrointestinal cancers, suggesting different functional roles of DCLK1 in different types of cancers. In clinical practice, NED is not routinely assessed; thus IBC-NED are not well studied. Its poor outcome and significant heterogeneity warrants more attention. DCLK1 expression could aid in the prognostication and management of this special cancer subtype.",NA,2/12/2015,D016428;D016448;D013485,10.18632/oncotarget.6386,NA,0,0,,

Postoperative platelet elevation is considered the foremost reason for PVT. However, the value of postoperative platelet elevation rate (PPER) in predicting PVT has never been studied.To investigate the predictive value of PPER for PVT and establish PPER-based prediction models to early identify individuals at high risk of PVT after splenectomy.We retrospectively reviewed 483 patients with PH related to hepatitis B virus who underwent splenectomy between July 2011 and September 2018, and they were randomized into either a training (n = 338) or a validation (n = 145) cohort. The generalized linear (GL) method, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and random forest (RF) were used to construct models. The receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curve (CIC) were used to evaluate the robustness and clinical practicability of the GL model (GLM), LASSO model (LSM), and RF model (RFM).Multivariate analysis exhibited that the first and third days for PPER (PPER1, PPER3) were strongly associated with PVT [odds ratio (OR): 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24-2.62, P = 0.002; OR: 1.43, 95%CI: 1.16-1.77, P < 0.001, respectively]. The areas under the ROC curves of the GLM, LSM, and RFM in the training cohort were 0.83 (95%CI: 0.79-0.88), 0.84 (95%CI: 0.79-0.88), and 0.84 (95%CI: 0.79-0.88), respectively; and were 0.77 (95%CI: 0.69-0.85), 0.83 (95%CI: 0.76-0.90), and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.70-0.85) in the validation cohort, respectively. The calibration curves showed satisfactory agreement between prediction by models and actual observation. DCA and CIC indicated that all models conferred high clinical net benefits.PPER1 and PPER3 are effective indicators for postoperative prediction of PVT. We have successfully developed PPER-based practical models to accurately predict PVT, which would conveniently help clinicians rapidly differentiate individuals at high risk of PVT, and thus guide the adoption of timely interventions.©The Author(s) 2022.

Its diagnosis can be challenging in primary care. Based on the SCOFF example, we aim to determine whether a quicker and simpler screening tool for FA in people with obesity could be developed, using artificial intelligence (machine learning).The first step was to look for the most discriminating items, among 152 different ones, to differentiate between FA-positive and FA-negative populations of patients with obesity. Items were ranked using the Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF). Retained items were used to test the performance of nine different predictive algorithms. Then, the construction of a graphic tool was proposed.Data were available for 176 patients. Only three items had a FCBF score > 0.1: ""I eat to forget my problems""; ""I eat more when I'm alone""; and ""I eat sweets or comfort foods"". Naive Bayes classification obtained best predictive performance. Then, we created a 3-item nomogram to predict a positive scoring on the YFAS.A simple and fast screening tool for detecting high-disordered eating risk is proposed. The next step will be a validation study of the FAST nomogram to ensure its relevance for emotional eating diagnosis.Level V, cross-sectional descriptive study.NCT02857179 at clinicaltrials.gov.© 2021.

Our objective was to determine the incidence and risk factors associated with post-cesarean delivery (CD) readmissions or unexpected visits, defined as unexpected office or emergency room visits.This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of adjunctive azithromycin prophylaxis for CD performed in laboring patients with viable pregnancies. Patients were followed up to 6 weeks postpartum. Our primary outcome was a composite of hospital readmission or unexpected visit, defined as unscheduled clinic or emergency department visits. Data of hospital readmissions, unexpected visits, and their reasons were collected. Demographics, antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum risk factors were evaluated in bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression modeling.A total of 1,019 women were randomized to azithromycin and 994 to placebo. The prevalence of readmission or unexpected visit was 10.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.9-11.6), with rates of 3.8% (95% CI: 3.0-4.7%) hospital readmissions, 6.9% (95% CI: 5.8-8.0%) emergency room visits, and 4.2% (95% CI: 3.4-5.2%) unexpected clinic visits. The most common causes were infectious disease and hypertensive disorder. Women with readmissions or unexpected visits were more likely to be obese and diabetic, as well as experience longer length of ruptured membranes, intrauterine pressure catheter placement, and postpartum fevers. On multivariable analysis, diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1-2.4), prolonged ruptured membranes (aOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.8), and postpartum fevers (aOR: 4.6, 95% CI: 3.0-7.0) were significantly positively associated with readmission or unscheduled visit, while azithromycin was a protective (aOR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9).Women who had postpartum fever were at especially high risk for readmission or unexpected visits. Diabetes, prolonged ruptured membranes, and postpartum fevers were significantly associated with the adverse outcome, and azithromycin was associated with lower rates of readmission and unexpected visits.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.",NA,17/03/2019,D016428;D016448;D016449;D013485,10.1055/s-0039-1683391,NA,0,0,,

Early identification and prediction of patients at risk of sepsis and adverse outcomes associated with sepsis are critical. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm that can predict sepsis early. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of an observational cohort study from the Intensive Care Unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. A total of 4,449 infected patients were randomly assigned to the development and validation data set at a ratio of 4:1. After extracting electronic medical record data, a set of 55 features (variables) was calculated and passed to the random forest algorithm to predict the onset of sepsis. Results: The pre-procedure clinical variables were used to build a prediction model from the training data set using the random forest machine learning method; a 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model. Finally, we tested the model using the validation data set. The area obtained by the model under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.91, the sensitivity was 87%, and the specificity was 89%. Conclusions: This newly established machine learning-based model has shown good predictive ability in Chinese sepsis patients. External validation studies are necessary to confirm the universality of our method in the population and treatment practice.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Li, Sun, Ding, Zhang, Liu, Han, Wang, Duan and Sun.",NA,2/11/2021,D016428;D064888;D016449;D013485,10.3389/fpubh.2021.754348,NA,1,1,,

Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by comparing the App-diagnoses with the final discharge diagnoses. Timing of diagnosis and time to treatment were correlated with complications, overall survival, and length of hospital stay.In this prospective, double-blinded study, 450 patients were enrolled and followed up until day 90. Ada suggested the final discharge diagnosis in 52.0% (95% CI [0.47, 0.57]) of patients compared with the classic doctor-patient interaction, which was significantly superior with 80.9% (95% CI [0.77, 0.84], P <0.001). However, when diagnostic accuracy of both were assessed together, Ada significantly increased the accuracy rate (87.3%, P <0.001), when compared with the ER physician alone. Patients with an early time point of diagnosis and rapid treatment allocation exhibited significantly reduced complications ( P< 0.001) and length of hospital stay ( P< 0.001).Currently, the classic patient-physician interaction is superior to an AI-based diagnostic tool applied by patients.

Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) which collects mammographic images from different angles and uses them to synthesize planes through the breast is simply another advance in mammography among others that have been made over the years. DBT ""absolutely"" detects more cancers at a time when cure is more likely while also having the advantage of reducing recall rates. The Tomosynthesis Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (TMIST) has been designed to compare DBT with 2-Dimensional Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM), but it's major design issues may provide misleading results. Instead of using a reduction in deaths as the endpoint, benefit in TMIST is predicated on a reduction in advanced cancers in the DBT group. This is a questionable ""endpoint"" (a reduction in advanced cancers is not necessary as proof of benefit). In addition, the trial may be underpowered so that even if DBT shows a benefit it may not be able to achieve ""statistical significance"". The six CISNET models of the National Cancer Institute have shown that annual mammography beginning at the age of 40 will save the most lives. Yet TMIST will only include women ages 45 and over and will screen postmenopausal women every two years instead of annually. Consequently, TMIST results may be used, inappropriately, to limit access to breast cancer screening starting at the age of 45, and only offer biennial screening for post-menopausal women.Copyright © 2021.

Improved EDQOL, disordered eating cognitions, and anxiety symptoms predicted less frequent binge eating and purging. Previous CBT and being employed predicted more frequent binge eating and purging at both assessments. Higher self-transcendence and self-directedness predicted less frequent binge eating. More severe binge eating and purging at baseline and end-treatment predicted more frequent binge eating and purging at subsequent assessments.

Mobocertinib (TAK-788) is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) designed to target human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ERBB2) exon 20 insertion mutations. However, the function of mobocertinib on HER2 exon 20 insertion-mutant lung cancer is still unclear. Here we conducted systematic characterization of preclinical models to understand the activity profile of mobocertinib against HER2 exon 20 insertions. In HER2 exon 20 insertion-mutant cell lines, the IC50 of mobocertinib was higher than poziotinib and comparable with or slightly lower than afatinib, neratinib, and pyrotinib. Mobocertinib had the lowest HER2 exon 20 insertion IC50/wild-type (WT) EGFR IC50 ratio, indicating that mobocertinib displayed the best selectivity profile in these models. Also, mobocertinib showed strong inhibitory activity in HER2 exon 20YVMA allograft and patient-derived xenograft models. In genetically engineered mouse models, HER2 exon 20G776>VC lung tumors exhibited a sustained complete response to mobocertinib, whereas HER2 exon 20YVMA tumors showed only partial and transient response. Combined treatment with a second antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) against HER2, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), synergized with mobocertinib in HER2 exon 20YVMA tumors. In addition to the tumor cell autonomous effect, sustained tumor growth control derived from M1 macrophage infiltration and CD4+ T-cell activation. These findings support the ongoing clinical development of mobocertinib (NCT02716116) and provide a rationale for future clinical evaluation of T-DM1 combinational therapy in HER2 exon 20YVMA insertion-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients. SIGNIFICANCE: This study elucidates the potent inhibitory activity of mobocertinib against HER2 exon 20 insertion-mutant lung cancer and the synergic effect of combined mobocertinib and T-DM1, providing a strong rationale for clinical investigation.©2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.",P01 CA098101|NCI NIH HHS|United States|P01 CA154303|NCI NIH HHS|United States|R01 CA219670|NCI NIH HHS|United States|R01 CA234183|NCI NIH HHS|United States,13/08/2021,D016428;D052061;D013485,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-1526,NCT02716116,1,1,,

In the second paper of this Series on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we considered important issues in the prehospital management of cardiac arrest. Successful resuscitation relies on a strong chain of survival with the community, dispatch centre, ambulance, and hospital working together. Early cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation has the greatest impact on survival. If the community response does not restart the heart, resuscitation is continued by emergency medical services' staff. However, the best approaches for airway management and the effectiveness of currently used drug treatments are uncertain. Prognostic factors and rules for termination of resuscitation could guide the duration of a resuscitation attempt and decision to transport to hospital. If return of spontaneous circulation is achieved, the focus of treatment shifts to stabilisation, restoration of normal physiological parameters, and transportation to hospital for ongoing care.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Treatment failure may be due to transplant complications or relapse. To identify predictive factors for transplantation outcome, we studied 519 patients with MDS or oligoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (AML, <30% marrow blasts) who received an allogeneic HSCT and were reported to the Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo registry between 2000 and 2011. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. High-risk category, as defined by the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), and monosomal karyotype were independently associated with relapse and lower overall survival after transplantation. On the other hand, older recipient age and high hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) were independent predictors of nonrelapse mortality. Accounting for various combinations of patient's age, IPSS-R category, monosomal karyotype, and HCT-CI, the 5-year probability of survival after allogeneic HSCT ranged from 0% to 94%. This study indicates that IPSS-R risk category and monosomal karyotype are important factors predicting transplantation failure both in MDS and oligoblastic AML. In addition, it reinforces the concept that allogeneic HSCT offers optimal eradication of myelodysplastic hematopoiesis when the procedure is performed before MDS patients progress to advanced disease stages.",NA,22/02/2014,D016428;D013485,10.1182/blood-2013-12-542720,NA,0,0,,

The consequences of inappropriate early or late delivery are potentially important yet practice varies widely around the world, with abnormal findings from fetal heart rate monitoring invariably leading to delivery. Indices derived from fetal cerebral Doppler examination may guide such decisions although there are few studies in this area. We propose a randomised, controlled trial to establish the optimum method of timing delivery between 32 weeks and 36 weeks 6 days of gestation. We hypothesise that delivery on evidence of cerebral blood flow redistribution reduces a composite of perinatal poor outcome, death and short-term hypoxia-related morbidity, with no worsening of neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years.Women with non-anomalous singleton pregnancies 32+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation in whom the estimated fetal weight or abdominal circumference is <10th percentile or has decreased by 50 percentiles since 18-32 weeks will be included for observational data collection. Participants will be randomised if cerebral blood flow redistribution is identified, based on umbilical to middle cerebral artery pulsatility index ratio values. Computerised cardiotocography (cCTG) must show normal fetal heart rate short term variation (≥4.5 msec) and absence of decelerations at randomisation. Randomisation will be 1:1 to immediate delivery or delayed delivery (based on cCTG abnormalities or other worsening fetal condition). The primary outcome is poor condition at birth and/or fetal or neonatal death and/or major neonatal morbidity, the secondary non-inferiority outcome is 2-year infant general health and neurodevelopmental outcome based on the Parent Report of Children's Abilities-Revised questionnaire.The Study Coordination Centre has obtained approval from London-Riverside Research Ethics Committee (REC) and Health Regulatory Authority (HRA).

Afterwards, we compared the estimated risks of ischemic and bleeding events between the patients in whom anticoagulant therapy was changed to those who continued the original treatment.After a mean follow-up time of 15.0±10.9 months, 192 out of 1240 patients (15.5%) had 207 ischemic or bleeding events corresponding to an annual rate of 13.4%. Among the events, 111 were ischemic strokes, 15 systemic embolisms, 24 intracranial bleedings, and 57 major extracranial bleedings. Predictive factors of recurrent ischemic events (strokes and systemic embolisms) included CHA2DS2-VASc score after the index event (odds ratio [OR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.3] for each point increase; P=0.05) and hypertension (OR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.0-5.1]; P=0.04). Predictive factors of bleeding events (intracranial and major extracranial bleedings) included age (OR, 1.1 [95% CI, 1.0-1.2] for each year increase; P=0.002), history of major bleeding (OR, 6.9 [95% CI, 3.4-14.2]; P=0.0001) and the concomitant administration of an antiplatelet agent (OR, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.4-5.5]; P=0.003). Rates of ischemic and bleeding events were no different in patients who changed or not changed the original nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants treatment (OR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.8-1.7]).Patients suffering a stroke despite being on nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant therapy are at high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke and bleeding.

Compliance with the homework in the different treatment components in TAIL, each aimed at a specific condition, was rated for 207 participants by independent assessors. Six subgroups (n = 34-131) were constructed consisting of participants with co-occurring symptoms of worry, panic, social anxiety, stress, insomnia, or pain. For each group, hierarchical regression was used to investigate whether the total sum of compliance points, Overall Compliance, predicted reductions in depression and in condition-specific symptoms. Also, in each subgroup, it was tested whether working with specific treatment components, Specific Compliance, predicted reduction of the targeted symptoms. Overall Compliance predicted 15% of the reduction in depression symptoms. For participants with worry, panic, social anxiety, stress, or insomnia, Overall Compliance also predicted symptom reductions in that specific condition. Specific Compliance predicted reduction in the targeted symptoms for participants with social anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Specific Compliance with stress and insomnia components also predicted reductions in depression. Our results strengthen the importance of compliance in internet-based treatments. Because compliance with stress and insomnia components was particularly important for broad symptom reductions, these conditions should not be ignored when treating patients with co-morbid symptoms.© 2019 The Authors Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Stockholms Läns Landsting|,17/01/2019,D016428;D016449,10.1002/cpp.2351,NA,0,0,,

In recent years, novel knowledge has emerged linking serum uric acid with a variety of conditions and related risk factors, from hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes, to fatal/nonfatal cardiovascular diseases and all-cause death, with the underlying mechanisms involving disrupted neurohormonal and metabolic signaling as well as oxidative stress and inflammation. Importantly, the cut-off value of serum uric acid that predicts the risk of incident events is within the range of normality and below the threshold for increased risk of gout. A large contribution to the advancement in knowledge in the cardiovascular implications of uric acid derives from the Italian study URic acid Right for heArt Health (URRAH).The URRAH study is an Italian nationwide, multicenter retrospective, observational cohort study combining data from outpatients attending hypertension clinics, as well as individuals recruited in prospective observational cohort studies with a follow-up period of at least 20 years up to July 31st, 2017. Data were retrospectively collected from different databases. At the end of the follow-up, the following hard endpoints were evaluated: fatal myocardial infarction; non-fatal acute myocardial infarction; heart failure; fatal stroke; non-fatal stroke; coronary revascularization.A total of 22,714 subjects were included in the analysis. During a median follow-up time of 134 months, a total of 3279 deaths were recorded, of which 1571 were due to cardiovascular causes. Multivariate Cox regression analyses identified an independent association between serum uric acid concentrations and both total (HR=1.53, 95% CI 1.21-1.93, P<0.001) and cardiovascular deaths (HR=2.08, 95% CI 1.146-2.97; P<0.001). Of note, the cut-off values of serum uric acid that were identified as those able to predict total mortality were largely within the normal range (4.7 mg/dL, 95% CI 4.3-5.1 mg/dL). Similarly, the cut-off value that better predicted cardiovascular death was within the normal range (5.6 mg/dL, 95% CI 4.99-6.21 mg/dL). The information on serum uric acid levels provided a significant net reclassification improvement of 0.26 and 0.27 over the Heart Score risk chart for total and cardiovascular mortality, respectively (P<0.001). Serum uric acid levels ≥4.7 or <4.7 mg/dL incrementally predicted all-cause mortality over the Heart Score.The results of studies from the URRAH database further strengthen the role of uric acid in cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, and total mortality. The identified cut-off values support clinicians in investigating serum uric acid levels in their patients and to consider uric acid as an additional cardiovascular risk factor. Taken together, the published papers deriving from the URRAH database emphasize the role of uric acid in favoring cardiovascular events, and strongly suggest the existence of ""grey"" areas, i.e. close but lower than the ""traditional"" threshold for hyperuricemia, which deserve further characterization.",NA,27/03/2021,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.23736/S0031-0808.21.04357-3,NA,1,1,,

Alvarado and RIPASA scores are the most commonly used and the purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of these two scoring systems.We searched MEDLINE (1966-2017), Scopus (2004-2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (2008-2017), Google Scholar (2004-2017) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL (1999-2017) databases. We selected all observational cohort studies that reported diagnostic parameters of Alvarado and RIPASA diagnostic scores on patients with clinical status of acute appendicitis. Statistical meta-analysis was performed with Meta Disc 1.4 software.Twelve studies were included in our meta-analysis which enrolled 2161 patients. The sensitivity of RIPASA score was 94% (95% CI, 92%-95%) and the specificity was 55% (95% CI, 51%-55%). In addition, the area under the Roc Curve (AUC) was 0.9431 and the diagnostic Odds Ratio was 24.66 (95% CI, 8.06 to 75.43). The sensitivity of Alvarado score was 69% (95% CI, 67%-71%) and the specificity was 77% (95% CI, 74%-80%). Moreover, the AUC was 0.7944 and the diagnostic Odds Ratio was 7.99 (95% CI, 4.75 to 13.43).RIPASA scoring system is more sensitive than Alvarado one, but the low specificity forms the need of a supplementary mean to provide the accurate diagnosis.

Exclusion criteria were any other psychiatric, neurological, or neurosurgical comorbidities, substance use or addictive disorders, and recreational ketamine consumption. Data were collected from January to February 2019 and from May to December 2019, and data were analyzed from January 2020 to July 2021.Patients with TRD were observed 24 hours before single ketamine infusion, 4 hours after the infusion, and 4 hours after the third infusion, which was 1 week after the first infusion. Healthy control participants were observed twice 1 week apart without ketamine exposure.Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score and belief updating after belief updating when patients received good news and bad news measured by a cognitive belief-updating task and mathematically formalized by a computational reinforcement learning model.Of 56 included participants, 29 (52%) were male, and the mean (SEM) age was 52.3 (1.2) years. A total of 26 patients with TRD and 30 control participants were included. A significant group × testing time point × news valence interaction showed that patients with TRD updated their beliefs more after good than bad news following a single ketamine infusion (controlled for age and education: β = -0.91; 95% CI, -1.58 to -0.24; t216 = -2.67; P = .008) than controls.

We evaluated the ability of this algorithm to predict incident AF in an emergency department (ED) cohort of patients presenting with palpitations without concurrent AF.This retrospective study included patients 18 years and older who presented with palpitations to one of 15 ED sites and had a 12‑lead ECG performed. Patients with prior AF or newly diagnosed AF during the ED visit were excluded. Of the remaining patients, those with a follow up ECG or Holter monitor in the subsequent year were included. We evaluated the performance of the AI-ECG output to predict incident AF within one year of the index ECG by estimating an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined at the optimum threshold (maximizing sensitivity and specificity), and thresholds by output decile for the sample.A total of 1403 patients were included. Forty-three (3.1%) patients were diagnosed with new AF during the following year.

The secondary aim was to develop and validate radiomics models for differentiating low-risk endometrial cancer from other endometrial cancers.This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study. From two participating centers, we identified consecutive patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometrial cancer who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination by an experienced examiner between 2016 and 2019. Patients recruited in Center 1 (Rome) were included as the training set and patients enrolled in Center 2 (Milan) formed the external validation set. Radiomics analysis (extraction of a high number of quantitative features from medical images) was applied to the ultrasound images. Clinical (including preoperative biopsy), ultrasound and radiomics features that were statistically significantly different in the high-risk group vs the other groups and in the low-risk group vs the other groups on univariate analysis in the training set were considered for multivariate analysis and for developing ultrasound-based machine-learning risk-prediction models. For discriminating between the high-risk group and the other groups, a random forest model from the radiomics features (radiomics model), a binary logistic regression model from clinical and ultrasound features (clinical-ultrasound model) and another binary logistic regression model from clinical, ultrasound and previously selected radiomics features (mixed model) were created. Similar models were created for discriminating between the low-risk group and the other groups. The models developed in the training set were tested in the validation set. The performance of the models in discriminating between the high-risk group and the other groups, and between the low-risk group and the other risk groups for both validation and training sets was compared.The training set comprised 396 patients and the validation set 102 patients. In the validation set, for predicting high-risk endometrial cancer, the radiomics model had an area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.80, sensitivity of 58.7% and specificity of 85.7% (using the optimal risk cut-off of 0.41); the clinical-ultrasound model had an AUC of 0.90, sensitivity of 80.4% and specificity of 83.9% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.32); and the mixed model had an AUC of 0.88, sensitivity of 67.3% and specificity of 91.0% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.42). For the prediction of low-risk endometrial cancer, the radiomics model had an AUC of 0.71, sensitivity of 65.0% and specificity of 64.5% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.38); the clinical-ultrasound model had an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 70.0% and specificity of 80.6% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.46); and the mixed model had an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 72.5% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.36).Radiomics seems to have some ability to discriminate between low-risk endometrial cancer and other endometrial cancers and better ability to discriminate between high-risk endometrial cancer and other endometrial cancers.

Systolic and diastolic BP measurements (SBP, DBP) were taken at ED presentation. Final diagnosis was consensus adjudication by stroke neurologists; patients were diagnosed as either TIA/MS or stroke-mimic (non-cerebrovascular conditions). Conditional inference trees were used to define age cut-points for predicting binary diagnosis (TIA/MS or stroke-mimic). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of BP, age, sex, and the age-BP interaction on predicting TIA/MS diagnosis.Over a 28-month period, 768 (71%) patients were diagnosed with TIA/MS: these patients were older (mean 71.6 years) and more likely to be male (58%) than stroke-mimics (61.4 years, 41%; each p < 0.001). TIA/MS patients had higher SBP than stroke-mimics (p < 0.001). DBP did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.191). SBP was predictive of TIA/MS diagnosis in younger patients, after accounting for age and sex; an increase of 10 mmHg systolic increased the odds of TIA/MS 18% (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.39) in patients < 60 years, and 23% (OR 1.23, 95% CI 11.12-1.35) in those 60-79 years, while not affecting the odds of TIA/MS in patients ≥80 years (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89-1.07).Raised SBP in patients younger than 80 with suspected TIA/MS may be a useful clinical indicator upon initial presentation to help increase clinicians' suspicion of TIA/MS.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03050099 (10-Feb-2017) and NCT03070067 (3-Mar-2017).

Therefore, we carried out an umbrella review to systematically summarize existing evidence on this topic. Methods: This study had been registered at PROSPERO (no. CRD42021262011). Relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies were identified by searching PubMed, Web of science, and Embase databases from inception up to March 15, 2021. Observational studies investigating the association between CV intake and multiple health outcomes in humans were eligible for inclusion. The validated AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) instrument was utilized for assessing the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews. For each meta-analysis, we assessed the summary effect size by using fixed and random effects models, 95% prediction intervals, heterogeneity, evidence of small-study effects, and excess significance bias. Results: Our umbrella review included 41 meta-analyses of 303 individual studies involving 13 394 722 participants. Twenty-four health outcomes including cancers (n = 23), cardiovascular disease (n = 12), mortality (n = 5), and metabolic diseases (n = 1) were evaluated. The summary random effects estimates were significant at P < 0.05 in 24 meta-analyses - all of which reported decreased risks of health outcomes. All were of moderate methodological quality in our study. Of the 41 meta-analyses, we observed suggestive evidence for beneficial associations between gastric cancer, lung cancer, endometrial cancer, and all-cause mortality. Moreover, 16 associations were supported by weak evidence, including breast cancer, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, colon cancer, colorectal adenoma, colorectal neoplasm, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and total cancer. Conclusions: It revealed that CV intake might be associated with beneficial effects on several health-related outcomes (gastric cancer, lung cancer, endometrial cancer, and all-cause mortality). Other associations could be genuine, but substantial uncertainty remains.

Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by comparing the App-diagnoses with the final discharge diagnoses. Timing of diagnosis and time to treatment were correlated with complications, overall survival, and length of hospital stay.In this prospective, double-blinded study, 450 patients were enrolled and followed up until day 90.

Myopia was defined as non-cycloplegic objective spherical equivalent refraction ≤ -0.50 diopters. Structural equation modeling and multiple linear regression models were used to analyze the associations between baseline choroidal and retinal thickness with axial elongation.Out of 1307 students examined at baseline in 2017, 1197 (91.58%) returned for follow-up examination in 2018, with a median age of 12.00 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.00) and included 667 boys (55.72%).

All of the data were entered in electronic format and the data was analysed in detail. Of the 1324 women studied, the VBAC rate was 65.3% and the incidence of scar rupture was 0.5%. The composite adverse maternal (postpartum haemorrhage and intensive care admission) and foetal outcome (still birth, 5-minute APGAR <7 and NICU admission) was more in the failed TOLAC group. Various demographic, clinical and obstetric factors were studied in detail between the successful and failed TOLAC groups. The favourable Bishop Score (>4) was independently associated with successful TOLAC (OR 4.3; 95% CI 3.3-5.6 p < .001). Maternal age of >30 years, (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.41-0.79; p = .001), labour induction (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.33-0.56; p < .001) and estimated foetal weight of >3500 g (0.31; 95% CI 0.14-0.6; p = .002) were the factors independently associated with failed TOLAC. Previous indication for a Caesarean Section and previous vaginal delivery were not found to be independently associated with the outcome of TOLAC. The predictive models for TOLAC need to be used cautiously and the risk assessment should be done on an individual basis.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? TOLAC is a reasonable strategy in Obstetrics especially after one Caesarean Section to minimise the morbidity associated with rising Caesarean Section. However, the maternal and foetal morbidity are more following unsuccessful TOLAC. The factors which predict the outcome of TOLAC are multifactorial which include maternal demographic factors, previous obstetric factors like indication for Caesarean Section, intraoperative complications, inter-pregnancy interval, current obstetric factors such as gestational age, Bishop Score before delivery, labour factors and foetal factors, e.g. sex and foetal size.What do the results of this study add? We tried to include all the possible factors which probably influence TOLAC and found only Bishop Score, maternal age, foetal size and labour induction were the factors independently associated with the outcome of TOLAC. A Bishop Score of >4 admission was the greatest predictor of successful TOLAC (OR 4.3). Similarly, labour induction and foetal size of >3.5 kg were associated with 60% and 70% less chance of VBAC, respectively.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The factors found to be associated with successful and failed TOLAC may be utilised to develop a predictive model. More so, prospective studies are needed to test such predictive models.",NA,22/06/2021,D016428;D064888,10.1080/01443615.2021.1916451,NA,1,1,,

Further analysis with a higher number of high-quality studies is needed to verify the conclusions.© 2022. The Author(s).",NA,11/10/2022,D016428;D017418,10.1186/s12876-022-02511-7,NA,1,1,,

Ischemia of cerebral tissue elicits an immune response in stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). This response, as detected by RNA expressed in immune cells, could potentially distinguish ischemic from nonischemic TNE.Analysis of 208 TIAs, ischemic strokes, controls, and TNE was performed. RNA from blood was processed on microarrays. TIAs (n=26) and ischemic strokes (n=94) were compared with controls (n=44) to identify differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate <0.05, fold change ≥1.2). Genes common to TIA and stroke were used predict ischemia in TIA diffusion-weighted imaging-positive/minor stroke (n=17), nonischemic TNE (n=13), and TNE of unclear etiology (n=14).Seventy-four genes expressed in TIA were common to those in ischemic stroke. Functional pathways common to TIA and stroke related to activation of innate and adaptive immune systems, involving granulocytes and B cells. A prediction model using 26 of the 74 ischemia genes distinguished TIA and stroke subjects from control subjects with 89% sensitivity and specificity. In the validation cohort, 17 of 17 TIA diffusion-weighted imaging-positive/minor strokes were predicted to be ischemic, and 10 of 13 nonischemic TNE were predicted to be nonischemic. In TNE of unclear etiology, 71% were predicted to be ischemic. These subjects had higher ABCD(2) scores.A common molecular response to ischemia in TIA and stroke was identified, relating to activation of innate and adaptive immune systems. TNE of ischemic etiology was identified based on gene profiles that may be of clinical use once validated.","c("" CIHR"", ""Canada"")|c(""R01 NS056302-04"", ""NINDS NIH HHS"", ""United States"")|c(""R01 NS056302"", ""NINDS NIH HHS"", ""United States"")|c(""NS056302"", ""NINDS NIH HHS"", ""United States"")|c(""R01 NS079153"", ""NINDS NIH HHS"", ""United States"")|c(""R01 NS075035"", ""NINDS NIH HHS"", ""United States"")|c(""R01 NS056302-05"", ""NINDS NIH HHS"", ""United States"")|c(""R01 NS097000"", ""NINDS NIH HHS"", ""United States"")",7/02/2012,D016430;D016428;D052061;D013485,10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.638577,NA,0,0,,

This review is framed around the 8 best practice advice points agreed upon by the authors, based on the results of randomized controlled trials, observational studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as well expert consensus in this field. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: After an unrevealing initial evaluation, endoscopic ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic test for unexplained acute and recurrent pancreatitis. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast and cholangiopancreatography is a reasonable complementary or alternative test to endoscopic ultrasound, based on local expertise and availability. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: The role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for reducing the frequency of acute pancreatitis episodes in patients with pancreas divisum is controversial, but minor papilla endotherapy may be considered, particularly for those with objective signs of outflow obstruction, such as a dilated dorsal pancreatic duct and/or santorinicele. There is no role for ERCP to treat pain alone in patients with pancreas divisum. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: The role of ERCP for reducing the frequency of pancreatitis episodes in patients with unexplained recurrent acute pancreatitis and standard pancreatic ductal anatomy is controversial and should only be considered after a comprehensive discussion of the uncertain benefits and potentially severe procedure-related adverse events. When pursued, ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy alone may be preferable to dual sphincterotomy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Surgical intervention should be considered over endoscopic therapy for long-term treatment of patients with painful obstructive chronic pancreatitis. Endoscopic intervention is a reasonable alternative to surgery for suboptimal operative candidates or those who favor a less invasive approach, assuming they are clearly informed that the best practice advice primarily favors surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: When ERCP is pursued, small (≤5mm) main pancreatic duct stones can be treated with pancreatography and conventional stone extraction maneuvers. For larger stones, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy and/or pancreatoscopy with intraductal lithotripsy may be required. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When ERCP is pursued, prolonged stent therapy (6-12 months) is effective for treating symptoms and remodeling main pancreatic duct strictures. The preferred approach is to place and sequentially add multiple plastic stents in parallel (upsizing); emerging evidence suggests that fully covered self-expanding metal stents may have a role for this indication, but additional research is necessary. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: ERCP with stent insertion is the preferred treatment for benign biliary stricture due to chronic pancreatitis. FCSEMS placement is favored over multiple plastic stents whenever feasible, given similar efficacy but significantly reduced need for stent exchange procedures during the treatment course. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Celiac plexus block should not be routinely performed for the management of pain due to chronic pancreatitis. The decision to proceed with celiac plexus block in selected patients with debilitating pain in whom other therapeutic measures have failed can be considered on a case-by-case basis, but only after discussion of the unclear outcomes of this intervention and its procedural risks.Copyright © 2022 AGA Institute.

However, current scores are not validated for variceal bleeding and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential parameters for the prediction of UGIB and patient outcomes.In this monocenter retrospective observational study, data from all esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) between November 2014 and February 2020 with suspected hemorrhage in our ICU were evaluated.Out of 345 included EGD, 42.3% of UGIB was diagnosed. 51.9% needed endoscopic intervention. Overall, 52.3% of included patients with UGIB died. Logistic regression showed that preceding variceal or non-variceal UGIB (p < .001), serum lactate (p = .001), heart rate (HR) (p = .005), and blood transfusions (p = .001) were significant predictors of UGIB. Previous UGIB (p < .001), male sex (p = .015), known varices (p < .001), serum albumin (p = .19) and use of catecholamines (p = .040) were significant predictors for the need of endoscopic intervention. Higher mortality was significantly associated with the usage of steroids (p < .001), malignant preconditions (p = .021), serum albumin (p = .020) and prolonged PTT (partial thromboplastin time) (p = .001).We were able to identify additional parameters that had previously not been included in existing scores to predict the risk of UGIB, the need for therapeutic endoscopy and mortality in ICU patients. Therefore, an extension of these scores is necessary. Further validation of identified parameters in multicenter trials is needed to improve risk scores for ICU patients.",NA,1/07/2022,D064888;D016428,10.1080/00365521.2022.2089860,NA,1,1,,

Beta blockers are well-established drugs widely used to treat cardiovascular conditions. Observational studies consistently report that beta blocker use in people with COPD is associated with a reduced risk of COPD exacerbations. The bisoprolol in COPD study (BICS) investigates whether adding bisoprolol to routine COPD treatment has clinical and cost-effective benefits. A sub-study will risk stratify participants for heart failure to investigate whether any beneficial effect of bisoprolol is restricted to those with unrecognised heart disease.BICS is a pragmatic randomised parallel group double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted in UK primary and secondary care sites. The major inclusion criteria are an established predominant respiratory diagnosis of COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV1 < 80% predicted, FEV1/FVC < 0.7), a self-reported history of ≥ 2 exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids in a 12-month period since March 2019, age ≥ 40 years and a smoking history ≥ 10 pack years. A computerised randomisation system will allocate 1574 participants with equal probability to intervention or control groups, stratified by centre and recruitment in primary/secondary care. The intervention is bisoprolol (1.25 mg tablets) or identical placebo. The dose of bisoprolol/placebo is titrated up to a maximum of 4 tablets a day (5 mg bisoprolol) over 4-7 weeks depending on tolerance to up-dosing of bisoprolol/placebo-these titration assessments are completed by telephone or video call. Participants complete the remainder of the 52-week treatment period on the final titrated dose (1, 2, 3, 4 tablets) and during that time are followed up at 26 and 52 weeks by telephone or video call. The primary outcome is the total number of participant reported COPD exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics during the 52-week treatment period. A sub-study will risk stratify participants for heart failure by echocardiography and measurement of blood biomarkers.The demonstration that bisoprolol reduces the incidence of exacerbations would be relevant not only to patients and clinicians but also to healthcare providers, in the UK and globally.Current controlled trials ISRCTN10497306 .

However, findings have been inconsistent possibly due to lack of consistent adjustment for confounding factors, small samples size and other sources of bias.Massachusetts deliveries among women ≥18 years old during 2013-2017 from state vital records linked to hospital discharges, observational stays and emergency department visits were linked to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System (SART CORS) and the Massachusetts All-Payers Claims Database (APCD).PCOS was identified by ICD9 and ICD10 codes in APCD prior to index delivery. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CI for pregnancy and delivery complications were modeled using generalized estimating equations with a log link and a Poisson distribution to take multiple cycles into account and were adjusted a priori for maternal age, BMI, race/ethnicity, education, plurality, birth year, chronic hypertension and chronic diabetes. Tests for homogeneity investigated differences between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI categories (<30, ≥30, <25 and ≥25 kg/m2) and between non-infertile deliveries and deliveries that used ART or had a history of subfertility (defined by birth certificates, SART CORS records, APCD or hospital records).Among 91 825 deliveries, 3.9% had a history of PCOS. Women with a history of PCOS had a 51% greater risk of gestational diabetes (CI: 1.38-1.65) and a 25% greater risk of preeclampsia (CI: 1.15-1.35) compared to women without a diagnosis of PCOS. Neonates born to women with a history of PCOS were more likely to be born preterm (RR: 1.17, CI: 1.06-1.29) and more likely to have a prolonged delivery hospitalization after additionally adjusting for gestational age (RR: 1.23, CI: 1.09-1.40) compared to those of women without a diagnosis of PCOS. The risk for gestational diabetes for women with PCOS was greater among women with a pre-pregnancy BMI <30 kg/m2.PCOS was defined by ICD documentation prior to delivery so there may be women with undiagnosed PCOS or PCOS diagnosed after delivery included in the unexposed group. The study population is limited to deliveries within Massachusetts among most private insurance payers and inpatient or observational hospitalization in Massachusetts during the follow-up window, therefore there may be diagnoses and or deliveries outside of the state or outside of our sample that were not captured.In this population-based study, women with a history of PCOS were at greater risk of pregnancy complications associated with cardiometabolic function and preterm birth. Obstetricians should be aware of patients' PCOS status and closely monitor for potential pregnancy complications to improve maternal and infant perinatal health outcomes.This work was supported by the NIH (R01HD067270).

Thus, we aimed to investigate thresholds of [-2] proPSA (p2PSA)-related parameters to predict reclassification of the first-year protocol biopsy (1-year PBx) and evaluate the influence of clinical decision-making.This was an observational, prospective cohort study conducted at 19 Japanese institutes. The inclusion criteria included clinical stage T1c/T2, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels ≤10 ng/mL, PSA density <0.2 ng/ml/cc, one or two positive biopsy cores, and Gleason score (GS) ≤6 (GS ≦7 for patients aged ≥70 years) at diagnostic biopsy. All participants were required to receive a blood-sampling test on a protocol visit at inclusion and at the 1-year PBx. PSA and PSA isoforms (free PSA, p2PSA) were measured, and parameters (%free PSA, %p2PSA, phi) were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to predict the reclassification risk. To assess the predictive power and thresholds for reclassification, we plotted Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the variables that yielded a net clinical benefit.A total of 135 patients were included, and 36 patients were reclassified on the 1-year PBx. Multivariate analyses showed that %p2PSA and phi at inclusion and p2PSA, %p2PSA, and phi before the 1-year PBx were significant predictors of reclassification at the 1-year PBx. The ROC analysis showed an optimal cutoff point, sensitivity, and specificity of %p2PSA and phi before the 1-year PBx of 1.64, 86%, 49% and 35.92, 89%, 47%, respectively. The DCA showed that phi before the 1-year PBx had the highest net benefit. The study limitation was its single-arm observational design.%p2PSA and phi before the 1-year PBx had a good prediction power. phi is the most useful indicator for clinical decision-making on active surveillance.This study is registered atthe Japan Trial Register with ID UMIN000009876 ( https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000011573 ).© 2021.

The aims of this study were to identify modifiable prognostic factors for high costs related to healthcare utilization among older people seeking primary care with a new episode of back pain; and to replicate the identified associations in a similar cohort, in a different country.Data from two cohort studies within the BACE consortium were used, including 452 and 675 people aged ≥55 years seeking primary care with a new episode of back pain. High costs were defined as costs in the top 25th percentile. Healthcare utilization was self-reported, aggregated for one-year of follow-up and included: primary care consultations, medications, examinations, hospitalization, rehabilitation stay and operations. Costs were estimated based on unit costs collected from national pricelists. Nine potential modifiable prognostic factors were selected based on previous literature. Univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to identify and replicate associations (crude and adjusted for selected covariates) between each modifiable prognostic factor and high costs related to healthcare utilization.Four modifiable prognostic factors associated with high costs related to healthcare utilization were identified and replicated: a higher degree of pain severity, disability, depression, and a lower degree of physical health-related quality of life. Kinesiophobia and recovery expectations showed no prognostic value. There were inconsistent results across the two cohorts with regards to comorbidity, radiating pain below the knee and mental health-related quality of life.The factors identified in this study may be future targets for intervention with the potential to reduce high costs related to healthcare utilization among older back pain patients.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04261309, 07 February 2020.

We designed the Prospective Observational Study of Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (PROSE-ICD) to identify risk factors and enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms that predispose to arrhythmic death in patients undergoing ICD implantation for primary prevention of sudden death.This is a multicenter prospective cohort study with a target enrollment of 1200 patients. The primary end point is ICD shocks for adjudicated ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The secondary end point is total mortality. All patients undergo a comprehensive evaluation including history and physical examination, signal-averaged electrocardiograms, and blood sampling for genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses. Patients are evaluated every 6 months and after every known ICD shock for additional electrocardiographic and blood sampling. As of December 2011, a total of 1177 patients have been enrolled with more nonwhite and female patients compared to previous randomized trials. A total of 143 patients have reached the primary end point, whereas a total of 260 patients died over an average follow-up of 59 months.

Using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), we compared outcomes using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation method with Cox regression models estimating the hazard ratio for time-to-event endpoints between groups.The sample included 538 patients treated at 18 centers in 1 state in the United States, of whom 307 received conventionally fractionated whole-breast irradiation and 231 received moderately hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation. The median follow-up time was 5.0 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.77-5.15 years). The 5-year IPTW estimates for freedom from local recurrence were 93.6% (95% CI, 87.8%-96.7%) in the moderate hypofractionation group and 94.4% (95% CI, 90.3%-96.8%) in the conventional fractionation group. The hazard ratio was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.51-2.17; P = .89). The 5-year IPTW estimates for recurrence-free survival were 87.8% (95% CI, 81.0%-92.4%) in the moderate hypofractionation group and 88.4% (95% CI 83.2%-92.1%) in the conventional fractionation group. The hazard ratio was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.62-1.67; P = .95). The 5-year IPTW estimates for overall survival were 96.6% (95% CI, 92.0%-98.5%) in the moderate hypofractionation group and 93.4% (95% CI, 88.7%-96.1%) in the conventional fractionation group. The hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.30-1.42; P = .28).Analysis of outcomes in this large observational cohort of patients with triple-negative, node-negative breast cancer treated with whole-breast irradiation revealed no differences by dose fractionation. This adds evidence to support the use of moderate hypofractionation in patients with triple-negative disease.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Patients with a known or previous urological malignancy were excluded.The primary outcomes were the presence or absence of urinary tract cancer (bladder cancer, upper tract urothelial cancer [UTUC], and renal cancer). Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression was performed with site and country as random effects and clinically important patient-level candidate predictors, chosen a priori, as fixed effects. Predictors were selected primarily using clinical reasoning, in addition to backward stepwise selection. Calibration and discrimination were calculated, and bootstrap validation was performed to calculate optimism.The unadjusted prevalence was 17.2% (n = 1763) for bladder cancer, 1.20% (n = 123) for UTUC, and 1.00% (n = 103) for renal cancer. The final model included predictors of increased risk (visible haematuria, age, smoking history, male sex, and family history) and reduced risk (previous haematuria investigations, urinary tract infection, dysuria/suprapubic pain, anticoagulation, catheter use, and previous pelvic radiotherapy). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the final model was 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.85-0.87). The model is limited to patients without previous urological malignancy.This cancer prediction model is the first to consider established and novel urinary tract cancer diagnostic markers. It can be used in secondary care for risk stratifying patients and aid the clinician's decision-making process in prioritising patients for investigation.We have developed a tool that uses a person's characteristics to determine the risk of cancer if that person develops blood in the urine (haematuria). This can be used to help prioritise patients for further investigation.Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our purpose was to assess whether adequacy of protein/energy intake impacts mortality in patients with BMI <20 in Western/Eastern intensive care units (ICUs) and high/low NUTRIC groups.Data from the International Nutrition Survey 2013-2014 were dichotomized into Western/Eastern ICU settings; BMI <20 or ≥20; and high (≥5)/low (<5) NUTRIC groups. Association of BMI <20 with 60-day mortality was compared in unadjusted and adjusted (Western/Eastern, age, medical/surgical admission, high/low NUTRIC group) logistic regression models. The impact of adequacy of protein/energy on 60-day mortality relationship was tested using general estimating equations in high/low NUTRIC groups, in unadjusted and adjusted models.Western (n = 4274) patients had higher mean BMI (27.9 ± 7.7 versus (vs) 23.4 ± 4.9, P < 0.0001) than Eastern (n = 1375), respectively.

Within 12 weeks, all residents admitted periodontal patients 5 days a week and participated in a case-based learning course using PCDS once a week. Two online case-based examinations were used to evaluate their diagnostic and therapeutic performance before and after training. The total accuracy rate of examinations and the accuracy rate of subitems were analyzed using paired samples T-test. The Bonferroni correction is used for multiple testing adjustments, and p < 0.05 was considered statistical significance.After training, the total accuracy rate of SRT exams raised from 65 to 76%. There was a significant difference in the accuracy rate before and after training (Mean = 0.103, SD = 0.141, p < 0.001). The accuracy of radiographic examination (type of alveolar bone absorption and hard tissue lesion of tooth) and making treatment plan was significantly improved after training (p < 0.005). However, residents' performance in diagnosing periodontitis and predicting the prognosis of affected teeth was not improved.The PCDS and CBL method effectively improved the residents' achievement in SRT examination, especially in identifying the type of resorption of alveolar bone and the hard tissue lesion of a tooth by radiographic examination and making an appropriate treatment plan for a periodontitis patient.

Hypoxaemia predicts disease severity in such patients but is poorly detected by clinical examination. Therefore, including pulse oximetry in the assessment of acutely febrile patients may improve clinical outcomes in LMIC settings.We systematically reviewed studies of any design comparing one group where pulse oximetry was used and at least one group where it was not. The target population was patients of any age presenting with acute febrile illness or associated syndromes in LMICs. Studies were obtained from searching PubMed, EMBASE, CABI Global Health, Global Index Medicus, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science and DARE. Further studies were identified through searches of non-governmental organisation websites, snowballing and input from a Technical Advisory Panel. Outcomes of interest were diagnosis, management and patient outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for Cluster Randomised Trials and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tools, as appropriate.Ten of 4898 studies were eligible for inclusion. Their small number and heterogeneity prevented formal meta-analysis. All studies were in children, eight only recruited patients with pneumonia, and nine were conducted in Africa or Australasia. Six were at serious risk of bias. There was moderately strong evidence for the utility of pulse oximetry in diagnosing pneumonia and identifying severe disease requiring hospital referral. Pulse oximetry used as part of a quality-assured facility-wide package of interventions may reduce pneumonia mortality, but studies assessing this endpoint were at serious risk of bias.Very few studies addressed this important question. In LMICs, pulse oximetry may assist clinicians in diagnosing and managing paediatric pneumonia, but for the greatest impact on patient outcomes should be implemented as part of a health systems approach. The evidence for these conclusions is not widely generalisable and is of poor quality.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

Discovery of robust prognostic markers separating patients who recover from patients with persistent pain and disability is critical for developing patient-specific treatment strategies and conceiving novel approaches that benefit all patients. Given that chronic pain is a biopsychosocial process, this study aims to discover and validate a robust prognostic signature that measures across multiple dimensions in the same adolescent patient cohort with a computational analysis pipeline. This will facilitate risk stratification in adolescent patients with chronic MSK pain and more resourceful allocation of patients to costly and potentially burdensome multidisciplinary pain treatment approaches.Here we describe a multi-institutional effort to collect, curate and analyse a high dimensional data set including epidemiological, psychometric, quantitative sensory, brain imaging and biological information collected over the course of 12 months. The aim of this effort is to derive a multivariate model with strong prognostic power regarding the clinical course of adolescent MSK pain and function.The study complies with the National Institutes of Health policy on the use of a single internal review board (sIRB) for multisite research, with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Review Board as the reviewing IRB. Stanford's IRB is a relying IRB within the sIRB. As foreign institutions, the University of Toronto and The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) are overseen by their respective ethics boards.

Median (Q1; Q3) TSF and SSF z-scores were respectively -0.01 (-0.8; 0.9) and 0.27 (-0.3; 0.9). All anthropometric indices tended to decrease with increasing GMFCS (p < 0.001). At t1 42.1% had at least one nutritional red flag, at t2 40.3% and at t3 41.4%. Of those with at least one nutritional red flag at t1 or t2, respectively 14.7% and 18.8% suffered weight loss 6 months later. A GMFCS >2 and dysphagia were associated with a higher risk for lower scores of nearly all nutritional indices.Underweight was detected in almost three quarters of CP patients with GMFCS 5 classification, whereas deficits in subcutaneous fat and arm muscle reserve were observed in one fifth. Nutritional red flags, present in about 40% of the Flemish CP children, were apparently not successfully addressed in clinical practice, since up to one-fifth of CP patients with warning signs lost even further weight in the following 6 months. Beside a GMFCS >2, dysphagia was one of the most common conditions influencing the presence of low nutritional indices.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

A sensitive and reliable breath test has the potential to greatly facilitate diagnoses and therapeutic monitoring of lung cancer.To investigate whether the breath test is able to detect lung cancer using the highly sensitive high-pressure photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPPI-TOFMS).This diagnostic study was conducted with a prospective-specimen collection, retrospective-blinded evaluation design. Exhaled breath samples were collected before surgery and detected by HPPI-TOFMS. The detection model was constructed by support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Patients with pathologically confirmed lung cancer were recruited from Peking University People's Hospital, and healthy adults without pulmonary noncalcified nodules were recruited from Aerospace 731 Hospital. Data analysis was performed from August to October 2020.Breath testing and SVM algorithm.The detection performance of the breath test was measured by sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).Exhaled breath samples were from 139 patients with lung cancer and 289 healthy adults, and all breath samples were collected and tested. Of all participants, 228 (53.27%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 57.0 (11.4) years. After clinical outcomes were ascertained, all participants were randomly assigned into the discovery data set (381 participants) and the blinded validation data set (47 participants). The discovery data set was further broken into a training set (286 participants) and a test set (95 participants) to construct and test the detection model. The detection model reached a mean (SD) of 92.97% (4.64%) for sensitivity, 96.68% (2.21%) for specificity, and 95.51% (1.93%) for accuracy in the test set after 500 iterations. In the blinded validation data set (47 participants), the model revealed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 92.86%, an accuracy of 95.74%, and an AUC of 0.9586.This diagnostic study's results suggest that a breath test with HPPI-TOFMS is feasible and accurate for lung cancer detection, which may be useful for future lung cancer screenings.",NA,31/03/2021,D016428,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.3486,NA,1,1,,

This study aims to investigate the actual long-term survival and its associated prognostic factors after LR for HCC patients with MVI.This study was conducted on HCC patients with MVI who underwent LR from January 2009 to December 2012 at five major hospitals in China. The patients were divided into the 'long-term survivor group' and the 'short-term survivor group'. The clinicopathologic characteristics, perioperative data and survival outcomes were compared between these two groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify predictive factors associated with long-term survival outcomes.The study included 1517 patients with an actual 5-year survival rate of 33.3%. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that HBV DNA > 104 IU/mL, alanine aminotransferase > 44 U/L, alpha-fetoprotein > 400 ng/ml, anatomical hepatectomy, varices, intraoperative blood loss > 400 ml, tumor diameter > 5 cm, tumor number, satellite nodules, tumor encapsulation, wide resection margin and adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) were independent prognostic factors associated with actual long-term survival.One-third of HCC patients with MVI reached the long-term survival milestone of 5 years after resection. Anatomical hepatectomy, controlling intraoperative blood loss, a wide resection margin, and postoperative adjuvant TACE should be considered for patients to achieve better long-term survival outcomes.© 2021.

This analysis aimed to describe national RPS treatment trends and explore potential variability among low-/high-volume hospitals (LVH/HVHs).In total, 5992 patients who underwent resection for primary RPS were retrospectively identified in the National Cancer Database (2004-2017). Time trend analyses examined rates of multivisceral resection (MVR), radiation, and chemotherapy use. LVHs were defined as those carrying out fewer than ten resections per year (N = 5433), whereas HVHs were defined as those carrying out ten or more (N = 559). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models compared trends between groups.MVR was more frequent at HVHs (63.7% versus 43.5%, p < 0.001). Use of radiation varied widely by hospital volume. HVHs more frequently employed preoperative radiation as compared with LVHs (14.7% versus 8.1%, p < 0.001). Throughout the study period, LVHs increased utilization of preoperative radiation (2.6% to 12.0%, p < 0.001) whereas rates at HVHs remained stable. Overall, LVHs utilized postoperative radiation significantly more frequently as compared with HVHs (14.7% versus 2.7%, respectively, p < 0.001). Postoperative radiation at LVHs remained stable until 2013 and sharply declined thereafter (16.7% to 6.9%, p < 0.001). Rates of postoperative radiation use at HVHs remained lower than those at LVHs at all time points.Strategies for resection and radiation use at LVHs have trended towards those of HVHs. Current national implementation of preoperative radiation, MVR, and chemotherapy remains heterogeneous. These findings inform future trial design and support standardization of care.© 2021.

We aimed to determine whether blood biomarkers of inflammation were associated with the evolution of brain lesions, persistent venous occlusion or functional outcome in patients with CVT.Pathophysiology of Venous Infarction-Prediction of Infarction and Recanalization in CVT (PRIORITy-CVT) was a multicenter prospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed CVT. Evaluation of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in peripheral blood samples was performed at admission in 62 patients. Additional quantification of interleukin (IL)-6 was performed at day 1, 3 and 8 in 35 patients and 22 healthy controls. Standardized magnetic resonance imaging was performed at day 1, 8 and 90. Primary outcomes were early evolution of brain lesion, early recanalization and functional outcome at 90 days.Interleukin-6 levels were increased in patients with CVT with a peak at baseline. IL-6, NLR and CRP levels were not related with brain lesion outcomes or early recanalization but had a significant association with unfavourable functional outcome at 90 days (IL-6: OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.05-1.56, P = 0.046; NLR: OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.4-1.87, P = 0.014; CRP: OR = 1.756, 95% CI: 1.010-3.051, P = 0.029).

This study was registered in the PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021248013).The combined effects were synthesized with the relative risks (RR) or standard mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).6 trials with a total of 51,657 participants were included, of which 6,175 were men with migraine. The pooled analysis indicated that migraine was associated with a significantly higher risk of ED as compared to the non-migraine general population (RR = 1.63, 95%CI: 1.34 to 2.0, P < .001). Consistently, men with migraine have a significantly lower IIEF-5 score than healthy controls (SMD = -3.64, 95%CI: -6.4 to -0.89, P = .01). Stratification analysis on the mean age indicated that the association between migraine and ED was much stronger in the migraine patients with age < 40 years (RR = 32.29, 95% CI: 6.41-162.64, P < .001; I2 = 0.0 %, P = .837) than in those with age > 40 years (RR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.11-2.78, P = .017; I2 = 89.2%, P = .002). Sensitivity analysis indicated that no single study had dominated the combined RR and the heterogeneity.ED is a common disease among migraine men, especially those patients whose age is under 40 years old. It shows a 32-fold increased risk of ED compared to the healthy controls. Migraine-induced ED may be correlated with multiple factors, that is, chronic illnesses, chronic pain, and psychosocial causes (like anxiety and depression). Since phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (ie, sildenafil) might induce or exacerbate migraine, thus it is not recommended to prescribe these drugs for patients with migraine-mediated ED.The present study provides evidence that migraine is associated with a significantly high risk of ED, especially in those aged < 40 years.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether LACE+ scores predict unplanned readmissions and adverse outcomes following orthopedic surgery. Use of the LACE1 index to proactively identify at-risk patients may enable actions to reduce preventable readmissions.LACE+ scores were retrospectively calculated at the time of discharge for all consecutive orthopedic surgery patients (n = 18,893) at a multicenter health system over 3 years (2016-2018). Coarsened exact matching was used to match patients based on characteristics not assessed in the LACE+ index. Outcome differences between matched patients in different LACE quartiles (i.e. Q4 vs. Q3, Q2, and Q1) were analyzed.Higher LACE+ scores significantly predicted readmission and emergency department visits within 90 days of discharge and for 30-90 days after discharge for all studied quartiles. Higher LACE+ scores also significantly predicted reoperations, but only between Q4 and Q3 quartiles.The results suggest that the LACE+ risk-prediction tool may accurately predict patients with a high likelihood of adverse outcomes after a broad array of orthopedic procedures.Copyright © 2020 National Association for Healthcare Quality.",NA,11/08/2020,D016428;D016448;D013485,10.1097/JHQ.0000000000000280,NA,1,1,,

The 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines suggest that apoB can be an alternative to non-HDL-C or LDL-C in patients with high triglyceride levels, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or very low LDL-C levels. This study explores whether apoB can also serve as predictive value for long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in normal people and specific coronary atherosclerosis patients.A total of 826 patients were followed up over 10 years, and the risk factors for MACEs were retrospectively analyzed in patients with CHD and particular subpopulations. All statistical analyses were performed in R software. Cox regressions were performed to assess independent risk factors of long-term MACEs in the atherosclerosis group and CHD subgroups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to evaluate the survival rate for patients in different apoB quartiles, and receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to compare apoB and other lipids in predicting the presence of long-term MACE.apoB could be a ""risk-enhancing factor"" in patients with coronary atherosclerosis disease, whereas in the Normal population, LDL-C still acted as a major risk factor for predicting MACEs. apoB was a good risk predictor for long-term cardiovascular events in coronary atherosclerosis (AS) patients, including the AS group and CHD subpopulations (including CHD + triglyceride ≥2.3 mmol/L, CHD + diabetes mellitus, CHD + body mass index ≥25 kg/m2, or CHD + metabolic syndrome). In patients with CHD whose condition was complicated with diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, apoB performed better than other lipids in predicting the presence of myocardial infarction, hospitalization due to angina, and cardiac death. Despite achieving optimal LDL-C or non-HDL-C levels, patients with CHD are still at risk of worse survival if they are unable to reach a low apoB level (lower cut points such as 65 mg/dL).More attention should be paid to special populations with residual elevations of atherogenic particle numbers, and greater focus should be placed on lowering baseline apoB to achieve long-term benefits. However, given that this was an observational study, the association of baseline apoB level and long-term MACEs only was evaluated; it is unclear whether the emergence of MACEs would be influenced by the dynamic changes of apoB. Because this was a retrospective and observational analysis, bias in data analysis was unavoidable; thus, the results cannot be used to generalize implications to broader patient populations, and more large-scale clinical trials are required to verify these findings.

We hypothesized that ALI could assist guidance of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).This retrospective study included 672 stage IV NSCLC patients treated with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy in 25 centers in Greece and Germany, and a control cohort of 444 stage IV NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy without subsequent targeted or immunotherapy drugs. The association of clinical outcomes with biomarkers was analyzed with Cox regression models, including cross-validation by calculation of the Harrell's C-index.High ALI values (>18) were significantly associated with longer overall survival (OS) for patients receiving ICI monotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.402, P < 0.0001, n = 460], but not chemo-immunotherapy (HR = 0.624, P = 0.111, n = 212). Similar positive correlations for ALI were observed for objective response rate (36% versus 24%, P = 0.008) and time-on-treatment (HR = 0.52, P < 0.001), in case of ICI monotherapy only. In the control cohort of chemotherapy, the association between ALI and OS was weaker (HR = 0.694, P = 0.0002), and showed a significant interaction with the type of treatment (ICI monotherapy versus chemotherapy, P < 0.0001) upon combined analysis of the two cohorts. In multivariate analysis, ALI had a stronger predictive effect than NLR, PD-L1 tumor proportion score, lung immune prognostic index, and EPSILoN scores. Among patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥50% receiving first-line ICI monotherapy, a high ALI score >18 identified a subset with longer OS and time-on-treatment (median 35 and 16 months, respectively), similar to these under chemo-immunotherapy.The ALI score is a powerful prognostic and predictive biomarker for patients with advanced NSCLC treated with PD-L1 inhibitors alone, but not in combination with chemotherapy. Its association with outcomes appears to be stronger than that of other widely used parameters. For PD-L1-high patients, an ALI score >18 could assist the selection of cases that do not need addition of chemotherapy.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

However, most studies remain confined to in silico validation in small internal cohorts, without external validation or data on real-world clinical utility. We developed a strategy for the clinical validation of deep learning models for segmenting primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours and involved lymph nodes in CT images, which is a time-intensive step in radiation treatment planning, with large variability among experts.In this observational study, CT images and segmentations were collected from eight internal and external sources from the USA, the Netherlands, Canada, and China, with patients from the Maastro and Harvard-RT1 datasets used for model discovery (segmented by a single expert). Validation consisted of interobserver and intraobserver benchmarking, primary validation, functional validation, and end-user testing on the following datasets: multi-delineation, Harvard-RT1, Harvard-RT2, RTOG-0617, NSCLC-radiogenomics, Lung-PET-CT-Dx, RIDER, and thorax phantom. Primary validation consisted of stepwise testing on increasingly external datasets using measures of overlap including volumetric dice (VD) and surface dice (SD). Functional validation explored dosimetric effect, model failure modes, test-retest stability, and accuracy. End-user testing with eight experts assessed automated segmentations in a simulated clinical setting.We included 2208 patients imaged between 2001 and 2015, with 787 patients used for model discovery and 1421 for model validation, including 28 patients for end-user testing. Models showed an improvement over the interobserver benchmark (multi-delineation dataset; VD 0·91 [IQR 0·83-0·92], p=0·0062; SD 0·86 [0·71-0·91], p=0·0005), and were within the intraobserver benchmark. For primary validation, AI performance on internal Harvard-RT1 data (segmented by the same expert who segmented the discovery data) was VD 0·83 (IQR 0·76-0·88) and SD 0·79 (0·68-0·88), within the interobserver benchmark. Performance on internal Harvard-RT2 data segmented by other experts was VD 0·70 (0·56-0·80) and SD 0·50 (0·34-0·71). Performance on RTOG-0617 clinical trial data was VD 0·71 (0·60-0·81) and SD 0·47 (0·35-0·59), with similar results on diagnostic radiology datasets NSCLC-radiogenomics and Lung-PET-CT-Dx. Despite these geometric overlap results, models yielded target volumes with equivalent radiation dose coverage to those of experts. We also found non-significant differences between de novo expert and AI-assisted segmentations. AI assistance led to a 65% reduction in segmentation time (5·4 min; p<0·0001) and a 32% reduction in interobserver variability (SD; p=0·013).We present a clinical validation strategy for AI models. We found that in silico geometric segmentation metrics might not correlate with clinical utility of the models. Experts' segmentation style and preference might affect model performance.US National Institutes of Health and EU European Research Council.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We calculated the DCA from the price of the best standard of care (i.e.: drugs that the institution would otherwise fund). A linear regression model was used to determine cost contributors and estimate their impact.The total DCA was ~ 4.9 million euros (31 clinical trials; 177 enrollees), representing ~ 30% and ~ 0,05% approximately of the annual pharmaceutical expenditures at the HCUVA and for the Spanish Health System, respectively. Cancer type analysis showed that lung cancer had the highest average DCA by trial, indicating that treatments in these trials were the most expensive. Linear regression analysis showed that the number of patients in a trial did not significantly affect that trial's DCA. Instead, cancer type, phase trials, and intention of treatment were significant cost contributors to DCA. Compared to digestive cancer trials, breast and lung trials were significantly more expensive, (p < 0.05 and p < 0.1, respectively). Phase III trials were more expensive than Phase II (p < 0.01) and adjuvant trials were less expensive than palliative (p < 0.05).We studied cost contributors that significantly impacted the estimated DCA from cancer clinical trials. Our work provides the groundwork to explore DCA contributors with potential to enhance public relations material and serve as a negotiating tool for budgeting, thus playing an important role to inform decisions about resource allocation.© 2022.

We aimed at investigating the performance of composite respiratory indexes as possible predictors of CPAP failure in ARF due to COVID-19.This was a multicenter, prospective, observational, and cohort study conducted in the respiratory units of three University hospitals in Milan and in a secondary care hospital in Codogno (Italy), on consecutive adult patients with ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia that underwent CPAP between March 2020 and March 2021. ETI transfer to the intensive care unit or death is defined CPAP failure. Predictors of CPAP failure were assessed before T0 and 1 hour after T1 CPAP initiation and included mROX index (ratio of PaO2/FiO2 to respiratory rate), alveolar-to-arterial (A-a) O2 gradient, and the HACOR (heart rate, acidosis, consciousness, oxygenation, and respiratory rate) score.Three hundred and fifty four patients (mean age 64 years, 73% males) were included in the study; 136 (38.4%) satisfied criteria for CPAP failure. A-a O2 gradient, mROX, and HACOR scores were worse in patients who failed CPAP, both at T0 and T1 (p < 0.001 for all parameters). The HACOR score was associated with CPAP failure (odds ratio-OR-for every unit increase in HACOR = 1.361; 95%CI: 1.103-1.680; p=0.004; AUROC = 0.742; p < 0.001).

The objective of this study was to prospectively externally validate both models at multiple centers.Are the HAL and HOMER models valid across multiple centers?This multicenter prospective observational cohort study enrolled consecutive patients with PET-CT clinical-radiographic stages T1-3, N0-3, M0 NSCLC undergoing EBUS-TBNA staging. HOMER was used to predict the probability of N0 vs N1 vs N2 or N3 (N2|3) disease, and HAL was used to predict the probability of N2|3 (vs N0 or N1) disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC), and calibration was assessed using the Brier score, calibration plots, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.Thirteen centers enrolled 1,799 patients. HAL and HOMER demonstrated good discrimination: HAL ROC-AUC = 0.873 (95%CI, 0.856-0.891) and HOMER ROC-AUC = 0.837 (95%CI, 0.814-0.859) for predicting N1 disease or higher (N1|2|3) and 0.876 (95%CI, 0.855-0.897) for predicting N2|3 disease. Brier scores were 0.117 and 0.349, respectively. Calibration plots demonstrated good calibration for both models. For HAL, the difference between forecast and observed probability of N2|3 disease was +0.012; for HOMER, the difference for N1|2|3 was -0.018 and for N2|3 was +0.002. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was significant for both models (P = .034 and .002), indicating a small but statistically significant calibration error.HAL and HOMER demonstrated good discrimination and calibration in multiple centers.

More than 15 years ago, genotype-phenotype correlation studies estimated the initial age of hearing deterioration in the fourth to fifth decade (ranging from 32 to 43 years). However, these analyses were based on relatively limited numbers of mainly symptomatic carriers using markedly different methodologies. The starting point for the hearing deterioration is more correctly determined with larger numbers of carriers and with a more clearly defined starting point of the hearing deterioration.The aim of this study was to determine milestone ages (start and maximal hearing deterioration, potential eligibility for hearing aids and cochlear implants based on pure-tone average [PTA]) in a large series of p.Pro51Ser COCH variant carriers. The degree of individual interaural asymmetry and the degree of variability (interquartile range) with which the hearing deterioration progresses across ages were also studied, and age-related typical audiograms (ARTA) were constructed.One hundred eleven Belgian and Dutch p.P51S variant carriers were identified and recruited for audiological investigation. Their hearing thresholds were compared with p50th, p95th, and p97.5th percentile values of presbyacusis (ISO 7029 standards). The onset and degree of hearing deterioration were defined and assessed for each frequency and with three PTAs (PTA0.5-4 [0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz]; PTA4-8 [4 and 8 kHz]; and PTA6-8 [6 and 8 kHz]). The milestones ages were derived from nonlinear regression model of hearing thresholds against age, for male and female carriers separately, because of different age-referenced limits. Interaural right-left asymmetry was assessed, and variability of hearing thresholds were calculated using interquartile range. ARTAs were built with both observed data and a prediction model.Hearing dysfunction in p.P51S carriers begins at about 38 years of age (ranging from 28 to 43 years) on average in female and 46 years (ranging from 42 to 49 years) in male carriers (third decade: female, fifth decade: male carriers), depending on the hearing frequency and with differences in deterioration sequence between both genders. These differences, however, were mainly due to more stringent age-referenced limits for men. In contrast, predictions (ARTA) did not show any difference of phenotypic expression between genders. At about 48 to 50 years of age on average, the majority of DFNA9 patients may need conventional hearing aids (PTA ≥ 40 dB HL), whereas this is about 56 to 59 years for cochlear implants (PTA ≥ 70 dB HL). There is a high degree of individual interaural asymmetry and interindividual variability throughout all ages.This study demonstrates that the onset of sensorineural hearing deterioration starts in the third decade and probably even earlier. Regardless of differences in estimates, DFNA9 expresses similarly in male and female carriers, but male carriers are much more difficult to identify in early stages of the disease. Comprehensive assessment of the natural course of DFNA9 is of particular interest to predict the age of onset or critical period of most significant function deterioration in individual carriers of the pathogenic variant. This will help to design studies in the search for disease-modifying therapies.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Conflicting results have been reported about the response to coronavirus infection and COVID-19 outcomes in men and women. Understanding predictors of intensive care unit admission might be of help for future planning and management of the disease.We designed a cross-sectional observational multicenter nationwide survey in Italy to understand gender-related clinical predictors of ICU admission in patients with COVID-19. We analyzed information from 2378 charts of Italian patients certified for COVID-19 admitted in 26 hospitals. Three hundred ninety-five patients (16.6%) required ICU admission due to COVID19 infection, more frequently men (74%), with a higher prevalence of comorbidities (1,78±0,06 vs 1,54±0,03 p<0.05). In multivariable regression model main predictors of admission to ICU are male gender (OR 1,74 95% CI 1,36-2,22 p<0.0001) and presence of obesity (OR 2,88 95% CI 2,03-4,07 p<0.0001), chronic kidney disease (OR: 1,588; 95%, 1,036-2,434 p<0,05) and hypertension (OR: 1,314; 95% 1,039-1,662; p<0,05).

Disease severity was assessed using a 7-point ordinal scale based on degree of respiratory illness. Patients were prospectively surveyed for 1 year after discharge for post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) through quarterly surveys. Demographics, comorbidities, radiographic findings, clinical laboratory values, SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology were captured over a 28-day period. Multivariable logistic regression was performed.The median age was 59 years (interquartile range [IQR] 20); 711 (61%) were men; overall mortality was 14%, and 228 (20%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Unsupervised clustering of ordinal score over time revealed distinct disease course trajectories. Risk factors associated with prolonged hospitalization or death by day 28 included age ≥ 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.01; 95% CI 1.28-3.17), Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 1.71; 95% CI 1.13-2.57), elevated baseline creatinine (OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.63- 4.80) or troponin (OR 1.89; 95% 1.03-3.47), baseline lymphopenia (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.61-2.97), presence of infiltrate by chest imaging (OR 3.16; 95% CI 1.96-5.10), and high SARS-CoV2 viral load (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.17-2.00).

Concerns were raised about the potential for delayed and more severe presentations and an increase in diagnoses such as diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health issues. This multinational observational study aimed to study the number of children presenting to EDs across Europe during the early COVID-19 pandemic and factors influencing this and to investigate changes in severity of illness and diagnoses.Routine health data were extracted retrospectively from electronic patient records of children aged 18 years and under, presenting to 38 EDs in 16 European countries for the period January 2018 to May 2020, using predefined and standardized data domains. Observed and predicted numbers of ED attendances were calculated for the period February 2020 to May 2020. Poisson models and incidence rate ratios (IRRs), using predicted counts for each site as offset to adjust for case-mix differences, were used to compare age groups, diagnoses, and outcomes. Reductions in pediatric ED attendances, hospital admissions, and high triage urgencies were seen in all participating sites. ED attendances were relatively higher in countries with lower SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (IRR 2.26, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.70, p < 0.001) and in children aged <12 months (12 to <24 months IRR 0.86, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.89; 2 to <5 years IRR 0.80, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.82; 5 to <12 years IRR 0.68, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.70; 12 to 18 years IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.74; versus age <12 months as reference group, p < 0.001). The lowering of pediatric intensive care admissions was not as great as that of general admissions (IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.45, p < 0.001).

Reductions were highest and sustained throughout the study period for children with communicable infectious diseases. The main limitation was the retrospective nature of the study, using routine clinical data from a wide range of European hospitals and health systems.Reductions in ED attendances were seen across Europe during the first COVID-19 lockdown period.

Generic patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) assess individual's HRQoL. The role for PROMs, a potential tool for predicting subsequent falls, remains under-explored. Our primary aim was to determine whether a baseline PROMs assessment of HRQoL may be a useful tool for predicting future falls.A secondary analysis of a 12-month randomized clinical trial (RCT) of a home-based exercise program among 344 adults (67% female), aged ≥ 70 years, with ≥ 1 falls in the prior year who were randomized (1:1) to either a home-based exercise program (n = 172) or usual care (n = 172). A negative binomial regression model with total falls count as the dependent variable evaluated the main effect of the independent variable-baseline HRQoL (measured by the Short-Form-6D)-controlling for total exposure time and experiment group (i.e., exercise or usual care) for the total sample. For the usual care group alone, the model controlled for total exposure time.For the total sample, the rate of subsequent total falls was significantly predicted by baseline HRQoL (IRR = 0.044; 95% CI [0.005-0.037]; p = .004). For the usual care group, findings were confirmed with wider confidence intervals and the rate of prospective total falls was significantly predicted by baseline HRQoL (IRR = 0.025; 95% CI [0.001-0.909]; p = .044).These findings suggest the ShortForm-6D should be considered as part of falls prevention screening strategies within a Falls Prevention Clinic setting.

We investigated the potential effects of disulfiram on SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity in an observational study using a large database of clinical records from the national US Veterans Affairs healthcare system. A multivariable Cox regression adjusted for demographic information and diagnosis of alcohol use disorder revealed a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with disulfiram use at a hazard ratio of 0.66 (34% lower risk, 95% confidence interval 24-43%). There were no COVID-19 related deaths among the 188 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients treated with disulfiram, in contrast to 5-6 statistically expected deaths based on the untreated population (P = 0.03).

In this study, we evaluated a newly developed deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for automated detection of colorectal polyps ex vivo as well as in a first in-human trial.For training of the DCNN, 116 529 colonoscopy images from 278 patients with 788 different polyps were collected. A subset of 10 467 images containing 504 different polyps were manually annotated and treated as the gold standard. An independent set of 45 videos consisting of 15 534 single frames was used for ex vivo performance testing. In vivo real-time detection of colorectal polyps during routine colonoscopy by the DCNN was tested in 42 patients in a back-to-back approach.When analyzing the test set of 15 534 single frames, the DCNN's sensitivity and specificity for polyp detection and localization within the frame was 90% and 80%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.92. In vivo, baseline polyp detection rate and ADR were 38% and 26% and significantly increased to 50% (P = 0.023) and 36% (P = 0.044), respectively, with the use of the DCNN.

Nightly they wore the Ava-bracelet that measured respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), wrist-skin temperature (WST) and skin perfusion. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by molecular and/or serological assays.A total of 1.5 million hours of physiological data were recorded from 1163 participants (mean age 44±5.5 years). COVID-19 was confirmed in 127 participants of which, 66 (52%) had worn their device from baseline to symptom onset (SO) and were included in this analysis. Multi-level modelling revealed significant changes in five (RR, HR, HRV, HRV ratio and WST) device-measured physiological parameters during the incubation, presymptomatic, symptomatic and recovery periods of COVID-19 compared with baseline. The training set represented an 8-day long instance extracted from day 10 to day 2 before SO. The training set consisted of 40 days measurements from 66 participants. Based on a random split, the test set included 30% of participants and 70% were selected for the training set. The developed long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm had a recall (sensitivity) of 0.73 in the training set and 0.68 in the testing set when detecting COVID-19 up to 2 days prior to SO.Wearable sensor technology can enable COVID-19 detection during the presymptomatic period. Our proposed RNN algorithm identified 68% of COVID-19 positive participants 2 days prior to SO and will be further trained and validated in a randomised, single-blinded, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial.

Appropriate and timely neuroimaging in the follow-up period is considered to be important in making management decisions. There is a paucity of evidence-based information in current UK, European and international guidelines regarding the optimal timing and type of neuroimaging following initial neurosurgical treatment. This study assessed the current imaging practices amongst UK neuro-oncology centres, thus providing baseline data and informing future practice.The lead neuro-oncologist, neuroradiologist and neurosurgeon from every UK neuro-oncology centre were invited to complete an online survey. Participants were asked about current and ideal imaging practices following initial treatment.Ninety-two participants from all 31 neuro-oncology centres completed the survey (100% response rate). Most centres routinely performed an early post-operative MRI (87%, 27/31), whereas only a third performed a pre-radiotherapy MRI (32%, 10/31). The number and timing of scans routinely performed during adjuvant TMZ treatment varied widely between centres. At the end of the adjuvant period, most centres performed an MRI (71%, 22/31), followed by monitoring scans at 3 monthly intervals (81%, 25/31). Additional short-interval imaging was carried out in cases of possible pseudoprogression in most centres (71%, 22/31). Routine use of advanced imaging was infrequent; however, the addition of advanced sequences was the most popular suggestion for ideal imaging practice, followed by changes in the timing of EPMRI.Variations in neuroimaging practices exist after initial glioblastoma treatment within the UK.

Disease severity was assessed using a 7-point ordinal scale based on degree of respiratory illness. Patients were prospectively surveyed for 1 year after discharge for post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) through quarterly surveys. Demographics, comorbidities, radiographic findings, clinical laboratory values, SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology were captured over a 28-day period. Multivariable logistic regression was performed.The median age was 59 years (interquartile range [IQR] 20); 711 (61%) were men; overall mortality was 14%, and 228 (20%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Unsupervised clustering of ordinal score over time revealed distinct disease course trajectories. Risk factors associated with prolonged hospitalization or death by day 28 included age ≥ 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.01; 95% CI 1.28-3.17), Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 1.71; 95% CI 1.13-2.57), elevated baseline creatinine (OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.63- 4.80) or troponin (OR 1.89; 95% 1.03-3.47), baseline lymphopenia (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.61-2.97), presence of infiltrate by chest imaging (OR 3.16; 95% CI 1.96-5.10), and high SARS-CoV2 viral load (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.17-2.00). Fatal cases had the lowest ratio of SARS-CoV-2 antibody to viral load levels compared to other trajectories over time (p=0.001). 589 survivors (51%) completed at least one survey at follow-up with 305 (52%) having at least one symptom consistent with PASC, most commonly dyspnea (56% among symptomatic patients). Female sex was the only associated risk factor for PASC.Integration of PCR cycle threshold, and antibody values with demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory/radiographic findings identified risk factors for 28-day outcome severity, though only female sex was associated with PASC.

An Observational, Prospective, Multicenter Study.","Data on prognostic tools for indicating mechanical ventilation in older people with COVID-19 are still limited. The aim of this research was to evaluate if the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), based on the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), may help physicians in identifying older hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 who might benefit from mechanical ventilation.Longitudinal, multicenter study.502 older people hospitalized for COVID-19 in 10 European hospitals.MPI was calculated using 8 different domains typical of the CGA. A propensity score, Cox's regression analysis was used for assessing the impact of mechanical ventilation on rehospitalization/mortality for 90 days' follow-up, stratified by MPI = 0.50. The accuracy of MPI in predicting negative outcomes (ie, rehospitalization/mortality) was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC), and the discrimination with several indexes like the Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) and the Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI).Among 502 older people hospitalized for COVID-19 (mean age: 80 years), 152 were treated with mechanical ventilation. In the propensity score analysis, during the 90-day follow-up period, there were 44 rehospitalizations and 95 deaths. Mechanical ventilation in patients with MPI values ≥ 0.50, indicating frailer participants, was associated with a higher risk of rehospitalization/mortality (hazard ratio 1.56, 95% CI 1.09-2.23), whereas in participants with MPI values < 0.50 this association was not significant. The accuracy of the model including age, sex, respiratory parameters, and MPI was good (AUC = 0.783) as confirmed by an NRI of 0.2756 (P < .001) and an IDI of 0.1858 (P < .001), suggesting a good discrimination of the model in predicting negative outcomes.MPI could be useful for better individualizing older people hospitalized by COVID-19 who could benefit from mechanical ventilation.Copyright © 2022 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

Canada is experiencing significant disruptions to cancer-related services, and the impact these disruptions (delays/deferrals/cancellations) have on the health care system and patients are yet to be determined. Given the potential adverse ramifications, how can Canada's health care systems build resilience for future threats? (2) Methods: To answer this question, CCC facilitated a series of four thought-leadership roundtables, each representing the views of four different stakeholder groups: patients, physicians, health care system leaders, and researchers. (3) Results: Six themes of strength were identified to serve as a springboard for building resilience including, (1) advancing virtual care and digital health technologies to prevent future interruptions in cancer care delivery. (2) developing real-time data metrics, data sharing, and evidence-based decision-making. (3) enhancing public-private-non-profit partnerships to advance research and strengthen connections across the system. (4) advancing patient-centricity in cancer research to drive and encourage precision medicine approaches to care. (5) investing in training and hiring a robust supply of health care human resources. (6) implementing a national strategy and infrastructure to ensure inter-provincial collaborative data sharing (4).

This study aims at assessing to which extent CT findings have prognostic implications in COVID-19 older patients.Hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 60 years or more enrolled in the multicenter, observational and longitudinal GeroCovid study who underwent chest CT were included. Patients were stratified by tertiles of age and pneumonia severity to compare CT findings. Hierarchical clustering based on CT findings was performed to identify CT-related classificatory constructs, if any. The hazard ratio (HR) of mortality was calculated for individual CT findings and for clusters, after adjusting for potential confounders.380 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with a mean age of 78 (SD:9) years, underwent chest CT scan. Ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and pleural effusion were the three most common CT findings, with GGO prevalence decreasing from younger to older patients and pleural effusion increasing. More severe the pneumonia more prevalent were GGO, consolidation and pleural effusion. HR of mortality was 1.94 (95%CI 1.24-3.06) for pleural effusion and 13 (95%CI 6.41-27) for cluster with a low prevalence of GGO and a high prevalence of pleural effusion (""LH""), respectively.

This tutorial reviews (a) what has been reported about neurological insults in cases of COVID-19 infection, (b) what is known from similar conditions in other disorders, and (c) how that combined information can inform clinical decision making. Method PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections, cognitive impairment observed following critical care, and disorders for which intermittent or chronic hypoxia is characteristic. These were combined with searches relating to cognition, brain, and communication. All searches were conducted between April 8 and May 23, 2020. Meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials addressing other critical illnesses were also included to extend findings to potential cognitive communication outcomes following COVID-19. Results COVID-19 infection results in a combination of (a) respiratory infection with mechanical ventilation secondary to inadequate oxygenation, (b) inflammatory system reactivity, and (c) increased blood clotting factors. These affect central nervous system function incurring long-term cognitive communication impairment in a proportion of survivors. Diagnostic and intervention approaches for such impairments are discussed. Conclusions The existing literature on cognitive sequela of COVID-19 infection is small to date, but much can be learned from similar viral infections and disorders. Although COVID-19 is novel, the speech-language pathology approaches to evaluation and intervention of other populations of critical care patients are applicable. However, speech-language pathologists have not routinely been involved in these patients' acute care. As such, this is a call to action to speech-language pathologists to address the unprecedented numbers of patients who will need their services early in the disease process and throughout recovery.",NA,19/09/2020,D016428;D016454,10.1044/2020_AJSLP-20-00147,NA,1,1,,

The placenta develops in the periconception period and forms the interface between mother and embryo/fetus. An unhealthy periconceptional maternal lifestyle, such as smoking, alcohol and under- and over-nutrition, can detrimentally influence placental development and function.The impact of maternal lifestyle on placental health is largely unknown. Therefore, we aim to summarize the evidence of the impact of periconceptional maternal lifestyle on clinical features and biomarkers of placental development and function throughout pregnancy.A comprehensive search in Medline, Embase, Pubmed, The Cochrane Library Web of Science and Google Scholar was conducted. The search strategy included keywords related to the maternal lifestyle, smoking, alcohol, caffeine, nutrition (including folic acid supplement intake) and body weight. For placental markers throughout pregnancy, keywords related to ultrasound imaging, serum biomarkers and histological characteristics were used. We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies published between January 2000 and March 2017 and restricted the analysis to singleton pregnancies and maternal periconceptional lifestyle. Methodological quality was scored using the ErasmusAGE tool. A protocol of this systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016045596).Of 2593 unique citations found, 82 studies were included. The median quality score was 5 (range: 0-10). The findings revealed that maternal smoking was associated with lower first-trimester placental vascularization flow indices, higher second- and third-trimester resistance of the uterine and umbilical arteries and lower resistance of the middle cerebral artery. Although a negative impact of smoking on placental weight was expected, this was less clear. Alcohol use was associated with a lower placental weight. One study described higher second- and third-trimester placental growth factor (PlGF) levels after periconceptional alcohol use. None of the studies looked at caffeine intake. Adequate nutrition in the first trimester, periconceptional folic acid supplement intake and strong adherence to a Mediterranean diet, were all associated with a lower resistance of the uterine and umbilical arteries in the second and third trimester. A low caloric intake resulted in a lower placental weight, length, breadth, thickness, area and volume. Higher maternal body weight was associated with a larger placenta measured by ultrasound in the second and third trimester of pregnancy or weighed at birth. In addition, higher maternal body weight was associated with decreased PlGF-levels.Evidence of the impact of periconceptional maternal lifestyle on placental health was demonstrated. However, due to poorly defined lifestyle exposures and time windows of investigation, unstandardized measurements of placenta-related outcomes and small sample sizes of the included studies, a cautious interpretation of the effect estimates is indicated. We suggest that future research should focus more on physiological consequences of unhealthy lifestyle during the critical periconception window.

Presepsin (PSP) is a soluble CD14 subtype that has recently been proposed as a novel biomarker in patients with sepsis. The aim of the current study was to detect the relation of PSP to the outcome of COVID-19 as well as its relation to other inflammatory biomarkers.This multicenter retrospective observational study was conducted in Saudi Arabia and Misr International Hospital, Egypt, from January 2021 to May 2021. Hospitalised patients who had positive throat swab of SARS-CoV-2 and radiological evidence of viral pneumonia (moderate and severe forms) were included in the study. Demographics and clinical features, as well as laboratory parameters, including serum ferritin, CRP, D-dimer and PSP, of enrolled patients were retrospectively collected. Pneumonia severity index (PSI) was used to evaluate the severity of pneumonia.A total of 202 hospitalised patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were enrolled in our study. Of 202 hospitalised patients, 67 (33.17%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A total of 176 (87.1%) patients survived and were discharged, whereas 26 (12.9%) patients did not survive. PSP level was found to be significantly elevated in nonsurvivor versus survivor group (median [IQR] 978.5 [755.8-1400] vs 516.5 [343.3-720], P<0.001) as well as in ICU versus non-ICU patients (median [IQR] 800 [631-1200] and 446 [320-626], respectively) (P<0.001). Elevated levels were also found to be associated with increased length of hospital stay.

Based on 78 vaccine efficacy or effectiveness (VE) data from 49 studies and 1,984,241 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected from 31 regions, we analyzed the relationship between genetic distance (GD) of circulating viruses against the vaccine strain and VE against symptomatic infection. We found that the GD of the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is highly predictive of vaccine protection and accounted for 86.3% (P = 0.038) of the VE change in a vaccine platform-based mixed-effects model and 87.9% (P = 0.006) in a manufacturer-based model. We applied the VE-GD model to predict protection mediated by existing vaccines against new genetic variants and validated the results by published real-world and clinical trial data, finding high concordance of predicted VE with observed VE. We estimated the VE against the Delta variant to be 82.8% (95% prediction interval: 68.7-96.0) using the mRNA vaccine platform, closely matching the reported VE of 83.0% from an observational study. Among the four sublineages of Omicron, the predicted VE varied between 11.9% and 33.3%, with the highest VE predicted against BA.1 and the lowest against BA.2, using the mRNA vaccine platform. The VE-GD framework enables predictions of vaccine protection in real time and offers a rapid evaluation method against novel variants that may inform vaccine deployment and public health responses.© 2022.

Patients underwent DCE-MRI examinations before and after TACE. A variable flip-angle unenhanced 3D mDixon sequence was performed for T1 mapping. A dynamic 4D mDixon sequence was performed after contrast injection for assessing dynamic signal enhancement. Nonparametric analysis was conducted on the time-intensity curves. Parametric analysis was performed on the time-concentration curves using a dual-input single-compartment model. Treatment response according to Liver Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v2018 was used as the reference standard. The comparisons within groups (before vs. after treatment) and between groups (nonviable vs. equivocal or viable tumor) were performed using nonparametric bootstrap taking into account the clustering effect of lesions in patients.Twenty-eight patients with 52 HCCs (size: 10-104 mm) were evaluated. For nonviable tumors (n = 27), time to peak increased from 62.5 ± 18.2 s before to 83.3 ± 12.8 s after treatment (P< 0.01). For equivocal or viable tumors (n = 25), time to peak and mean transit time significantly increased (from 54.4 ± 24.1 s to 69.5 ± 18.9 s, P < 0.01 and from 14.2 ± 11.8 s to 33.9 ± 36.8 s, P= 0.01, respectively) and the transfer constant from the extracellular and extravascular space to the central vein significantly decreased from 14.8 ± 14.1 to 8.1 ± 9.1 s-1 after treatment (P= 0.01).This prospective pilot DCE-MRI study showed that time to peak significantly changed after TACE treatment for both groups (nonviable tumors and equivocal or viable tumors). In our cohort, several perfusion parameters may provide an objective marker for differentiation of treatment response after TACE in HCC patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to develop an ABP risk nomogram in patients with symptomatic gallstones.We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study and data on 816 conservatively treated patients with symptomatic gallstones admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University between January 6, 2007 and January 22, 2016 were retrospectively collected. We conducted a propensity-score matched (PSM) analysis based on follow-up time in a ratio of 1:4 between ABP group (n=65) and non-ABP group (n=260). These matched patients were randomly divided into study cohort (n=229) and validation cohort (n=96) according to a ratio of 7:3. In the study cohort, independent risk factors for ABP occurrence identified using Cox regression were included in nomogram. Nomogram performance and discrimination were assessed using the concordance index (C-index), area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC). The model was also validated in the validation cohort.Nomogram was based on 7 independent risk factors: age, diabetes history, gallbladder wall thickness, gallstone diameter, coexisting common bile duct (CBD) stones, direct bilirubin (DBIL), and white blood cell count (WBC). The C-index of nomogram was 0.888, and the 10-year AUCs of nomogram was 0.955. In the validation cohort, nomogram still had good discrimination (C-index, 0.857; 10-year AUC, 0.814). The calibration curve showed good homogeneity between the prediction by nomogram and the actual observation.

The cornea-related morphology was measured using an ocular anterior segment analysis system. The geographic indexes of each city and meteorological indexes of daily city-level data from the past 40 years (1980-2019) were obtained. Correlation analyses at the city level and multilevel model analyses at the eye level were performed.In total, 114,067 eyes were used for analysis. In the correlation analyses at the city level, the corneal thickness was positively correlated with the mean values of precipitation (highest r [correlation coefficient]: >0.700), temperature, and relative humidity (RH), as well as the amount of annual variation in precipitation (r: 0.548 to 0.721), and negatively correlated with the mean daily difference in the temperature (DIF T), duration of sunshine, and variance in RH (r: -0.694 to 0.495).

In total 19,988 eyes were analyzed at the eye level. After adjusting for age, precipitation was the major explanatory factor among the environmental factors for the variability in corneal thickness and AC volume.Individuals who were raised in warm and wet environments had thicker corneas and smaller AC volumes than those from cold and dry ambient environments.

Artificial intelligence has shown promise in endoscopy, but few cystoscopic applications have been reported. We report a Cystoscopy Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System (CAIDS) for BCa diagnosis.In total, 69 204 images from 10 729 consecutive patients from 6 hospitals were collected and divided into training, internal validation, and external validation sets. The CAIDS was built using a pyramid scene parsing network and transfer learning. A subset (n = 260) of the validation sets was used for a performance comparison between the CAIDS and urologists for complex lesion detection. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.The diagnostic accuracies of the CAIDS were 0.977 (95% CI = 0.974 to 0.979) in the internal validation set and 0.990 (95% CI = 0.979 to 0.996), 0.982 (95% CI = 0.974 to 0.988), 0.978 (95% CI = 0.959 to 0.989), and 0.991 (95% CI = 0.987 to 0.994) in different external validation sets. In the CAIDS vs urologists' comparisons, the CAIDS showed high accuracy and sensitivity (accuracy = 0.939, 95% CI = 0.902 to 0.964; sensitivity = 0.954, 95% CI = 0.902 to 0.983) with a short latency of 12 seconds, much more accurate and quicker than the expert urologists.The CAIDS achieved accurate BCa detection with a short latency. The CAIDS may provide many clinical benefits, from increasing the diagnostic accuracy for BCa, even for commonly misdiagnosed cases such as flat cancerous tissue (carcinoma in situ), to reducing the operation time for cystoscopy.© The Author(s) 2021.

We validated the model on three temporal validation sets from different waves of infection in Hong Kong. For predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection, the ML model achieved high AUCs and specificity but low sensitivity in all three validation sets (AUC: 89.9-95.8%; Sensitivity: 55.5-77.8%; Specificity: 91.5-98.3%). When used in adjunction with radiologist interpretations of chest radiographs, the sensitivity was over 90% while keeping moderate specificity.

Screening and treatment reduces this risk, but requires multiple examinations of infants, most of whom will not develop severe disease. Previous work has suggested that artificial intelligence may be able to detect incident severe disease (treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity [TR-ROP]) before clinical diagnosis. We aimed to build a risk model that combined artificial intelligence with clinical demographics to reduce the number of examinations without missing cases of TR-ROP.Infants undergoing routine ROP screening examinations (1579 total eyes, 190 with TR-ROP) were recruited from 8 North American study centers. A vascular severity score (VSS) was derived from retinal fundus images obtained at 32 to 33 weeks' postmenstrual age. Seven ElasticNet logistic regression models were trained on all combinations of birth weight, gestational age, and VSS. The area under the precision-recall curve was used to identify the highest-performing model.The gestational age + VSS model had the highest performance (mean ± SD area under the precision-recall curve: 0.35 ± 0.11). On 2 different test data sets (n = 444 and n = 132), sensitivity was 100% (positive predictive value: 28.1% and 22.6%) and specificity was 48.9% and 80.8% (negative predictive value: 100.0%).Using a single examination, this model identified all infants who developed TR-ROP, on average, >1 month before diagnosis with moderate to high specificity. This approach could lead to earlier identification of incident severe ROP, reducing late diagnosis and treatment while simultaneously reducing the number of ROP examinations and unnecessary physiologic stress for low-risk infants.Copyright © 2021 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.",R01 EY019474|NEI NIH HHS|United States|P30 EY010572|NEI NIH HHS|United States|R01 EY031331|NEI NIH HHS|United States|T15 LM007088|NLM NIH HHS|United States|R21 EY031883|NEI NIH HHS|United States|R01 HD107493|NICHD NIH HHS|United States,24/11/2021,D016428;D016448;D052061,10.1542/peds.2021-051772,NA,1,1,0,"matches scope of NCT, PI is author"

Concerns were raised about the potential for delayed and more severe presentations and an increase in diagnoses such as diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health issues. This multinational observational study aimed to study the number of children presenting to EDs across Europe during the early COVID-19 pandemic and factors influencing this and to investigate changes in severity of illness and diagnoses.Routine health data were extracted retrospectively from electronic patient records of children aged 18 years and under, presenting to 38 EDs in 16 European countries for the period January 2018 to May 2020, using predefined and standardized data domains. Observed and predicted numbers of ED attendances were calculated for the period February 2020 to May 2020. Poisson models and incidence rate ratios (IRRs), using predicted counts for each site as offset to adjust for case-mix differences, were used to compare age groups, diagnoses, and outcomes. Reductions in pediatric ED attendances, hospital admissions, and high triage urgencies were seen in all participating sites. ED attendances were relatively higher in countries with lower SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (IRR 2.26, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.70, p < 0.001) and in children aged <12 months (12 to <24 months IRR 0.86, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.89; 2 to <5 years IRR 0.80, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.82; 5 to <12 years IRR 0.68, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.70; 12 to 18 years IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.74; versus age <12 months as reference group, p < 0.001). The lowering of pediatric intensive care admissions was not as great as that of general admissions (IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.45, p < 0.001). Lower triage urgencies were reduced more than higher triage urgencies (urgent triage IRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.12; emergent and very urgent triage IRR 1.53, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.57; versus nonurgent triage category, p < 0.001). Reductions were highest and sustained throughout the study period for children with communicable infectious diseases. The main limitation was the retrospective nature of the study, using routine clinical data from a wide range of European hospitals and health systems.Reductions in ED attendances were seen across Europe during the first COVID-19 lockdown period. More severely ill children continued to attend hospital more frequently compared to those with minor injuries and illnesses, although absolute numbers fell.ISRCTN91495258 https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN91495258.",ACL-2018-021-007|Department of Health|United Kingdom,27/08/2022,D016428;D064888;D013485,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003974,ISRCTN91495258,1,1,,

A negative FFRCT has been shown to have low cardiac event rates compared to those with a positive FFRCT. However, the clinical utility of FFRCT according to age is not known.Patients' in the ADVANCE (Assessing Diagnostic Value of Non-invasive FFRCT in Coronary Care) registry, were stratified into those ≥65 or <65 years of age. The impact of FFRCT on clinical decision-making, as assessed by patient age, was determined by evaluating patient management using CTA results alone, followed by site investigators submitting a report on the treatment plan based upon the newly provided FFRCT data. Outcomes at 1-year post CTA were assessed, including major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality or unplanned hospitalization for ACS leading to revascularisation) and total revascularisation. Positive FFRCT was deemed to be ​≤ ​0.8.FFRCT was calculated in 1849 (40.6%) subjects aged <65 and 2704 (59.4%) ​≥ ​65 years of age. Subjects ≥65 years were more likely to have anatomic obstructive disease on CTA (≥50% stenosis), compared to those aged <65 (69.7% and 73.2% respectively, p ​= ​0.008). There was a similar graded increase in recommended and actual revascularisation with either CABG or PCI, with declining FFRCT strata for subjects above and below the age of 65. MACE and revascularisation rates were not significantly different for those ​≥ ​or <65, regardless of FFRCT positivity or stenosis severity <50% or ≥50%. With a negative FFRCT result, and anatomical stenosis ≥50%, those ​≥ ​and <65 years of age, had similar rates of MACE (0.2% for both, p ​= ​0.1) and revascularisation (8.7% and 10.4% respectively p ​= ​0.4). Logistic regression analysis, with age as a continuous variable, and adjustment for Diamond Forrester Risk, baseline FFRCT and treatment (CABG, PCI, medical therapy), indicated a statistically significant, but small increase in the odds of a MACE event with increasing age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.006-1.08, p ​= ​0.02). Amongst patients with a FFRCT > 0.80, there was no effect of age on the odds of revascularisation.The findings of this study point to a low risk of MACE events or need for revascularisation in those aged ​≥ ​or <65 with a FFRCT>0.80, despite the higher incidence of anatomic obstructive CAD in those ≥65 years. The findings show the clinical usefulness and outcomes of FFRCT are largely constant regardless of age.Copyright © 2020 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The secondary aim was to develop and validate radiomics models for differentiating low-risk endometrial cancer from other endometrial cancers.This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study. From two participating centers, we identified consecutive patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometrial cancer who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination by an experienced examiner between 2016 and 2019. Patients recruited in Center 1 (Rome) were included as the training set and patients enrolled in Center 2 (Milan) formed the external validation set. Radiomics analysis (extraction of a high number of quantitative features from medical images) was applied to the ultrasound images. Clinical (including preoperative biopsy), ultrasound and radiomics features that were statistically significantly different in the high-risk group vs the other groups and in the low-risk group vs the other groups on univariate analysis in the training set were considered for multivariate analysis and for developing ultrasound-based machine-learning risk-prediction models. For discriminating between the high-risk group and the other groups, a random forest model from the radiomics features (radiomics model), a binary logistic regression model from clinical and ultrasound features (clinical-ultrasound model) and another binary logistic regression model from clinical, ultrasound and previously selected radiomics features (mixed model) were created. Similar models were created for discriminating between the low-risk group and the other groups. The models developed in the training set were tested in the validation set. The performance of the models in discriminating between the high-risk group and the other groups, and between the low-risk group and the other risk groups for both validation and training sets was compared.The training set comprised 396 patients and the validation set 102 patients. In the validation set, for predicting high-risk endometrial cancer, the radiomics model had an area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.80, sensitivity of 58.7% and specificity of 85.7% (using the optimal risk cut-off of 0.41); the clinical-ultrasound model had an AUC of 0.90, sensitivity of 80.4% and specificity of 83.9% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.32); and the mixed model had an AUC of 0.88, sensitivity of 67.3% and specificity of 91.0% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.42). For the prediction of low-risk endometrial cancer, the radiomics model had an AUC of 0.71, sensitivity of 65.0% and specificity of 64.5% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.38); the clinical-ultrasound model had an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 70.0% and specificity of 80.6% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.46); and the mixed model had an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 72.5% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.36).Radiomics seems to have some ability to discriminate between low-risk endometrial cancer and other endometrial cancers and better ability to discriminate between high-risk endometrial cancer and other endometrial cancers. However, the addition of radiomics features to the clinical-ultrasound models did not result in any notable increase in performance. Other efficacy studies and further effectiveness studies are needed to validate the performance of the models. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.© 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.",NA,30/10/2021,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1002/uog.24805,NA,1,1,,

Surgical resection is provided as distal pancreatectomy for cancers of the body and tail of the pancreas. It can be performed by laparoscopic or open surgery. In operations on other organs, laparoscopic surgery has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stay as compared with open surgery. However, concerns remain about the safety of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy compared with open distal pancreatectomy in terms of postoperative complications and oncological clearance.To assess the benefits and harms of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy for people undergoing distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the body or tail of the pancreas, or both.We used search strategies to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded and trials registers until June 2015 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies. We also searched the reference lists of included trials to identify additional studies.We considered for inclusion in the review RCTs and non-randomised studies comparing laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, irrespective of language, blinding or publication status..Two review authors independently identified trials and independently extracted data. We calculated odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs) or hazard ratios (HRs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with RevMan 5 on the basis of intention-to-treat analysis when possible.We found no RCTs on this topic. We included in this review 12 non-randomised studies that compared laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy (1576 participants: 394 underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and 1182 underwent open distal pancreatectomy); 11 studies (1506 participants: 353 undergoing laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and 1153 undergoing open distal pancreatectomy) provided information for one or more outcomes. All of these studies were retrospective cohort-like studies or case-control studies. Most were at unclear or high risk of bias, and the overall quality of evidence was very low for all reported outcomes.Differences in short-term mortality (laparoscopic group: 1/329 (adjusted proportion based on meta-analysis estimate: 0.5%) vs open group: 11/1122 (1%); OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.17; 1451 participants; nine studies; I(2) = 0%), long-term mortality (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12; 277 participants; three studies; I(2) = 0%), proportion of people with serious adverse events (laparoscopic group: 7/89 (adjusted proportion: 8.8%) vs open group: 6/117 (5.1%); OR 1.79, 95% CI 0.53 to 6.06; 206 participants; three studies; I(2) = 0%), proportion of people with a clinically significant pancreatic fistula (laparoscopic group: 9/109 (adjusted proportion: 7.7%) vs open group: 9/137 (6.6%); OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.02; 246 participants; four studies; I(2) = 61%) were imprecise. Differences in recurrence at maximal follow-up (laparoscopic group: 37/81 (adjusted proportion based on meta-analysis estimate: 36.3%) vs open group: 59/103 (49.5%); OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.05; 184 participants; two studies; I(2) = 13%), adverse events of any severity (laparoscopic group: 33/109 (adjusted proportion: 31.7%) vs open group: 45/137 (32.8%); OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.66; 246 participants; four studies; I(2) = 18%) and proportion of participants with positive resection margins (laparoscopic group: 49/333 (adjusted proportion based on meta-analysis estimate: 14.3%) vs open group: 208/1133 (18.4%); OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.10; 1466 participants; 10 studies; I(2) = 6%) were also imprecise. Mean length of hospital stay was shorter by 2.43 days in the laparoscopic group than in the open group (MD -2.43 days, 95% CI -3.13 to -1.73; 1068 participants; five studies; I(2) = 0%). None of the included studies reported quality of life at any point in time, recurrence within six months, time to return to normal activity and time to return to work or blood transfusion requirements.Currently, no randomised controlled trials have compared laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy for patients with pancreatic cancers. In observational studies, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy has been associated with shorter hospital stay as compared with open distal pancreatectomy. Currently, no information is available to determine a causal association in the differences between laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy. Observed differences may be a result of confounding due to laparoscopic operation on less extensive cancer and open surgery on more extensive cancer. In addition, differences in length of hospital stay are relevant only if laparoscopic and open surgery procedures are equivalent oncologically. This information is not available currently. Thus, randomised controlled trials are needed to compare laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy with at least two to three years of follow-up. Such studies should include patient-oriented outcomes such as short-term mortality and long-term mortality (at least two to three years); health-related quality of life; complications and the sequelae of complications; resection margins; measures of earlier postoperative recovery such as length of hospital stay, time to return to normal activity and time to return to work (in those who are employed); and recurrence of cancer.",13/89/03|Department of Health|United Kingdom,5/04/2016,D016428;D017418;D013485;D016454;D000078182,10.1002/14651858.CD011391.pub2,NA,0,0,,

However, assessing the large number of possible stimulation settings (i.e., programming) requires numerous clinic visits. Here, we examine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to predict optimal stimulation settings for individual patients. We analyze 3 T fMRI data prospectively acquired as part of an observational trial in 67 PD patients using optimal and non-optimal stimulation settings. Clinically optimal stimulation produces a characteristic fMRI brain response pattern marked by preferential engagement of the motor circuit. Then, we build a machine learning model predicting optimal vs. non-optimal settings using the fMRI patterns of 39 PD patients with a priori clinically optimized DBS (88% accuracy). The model predicts optimal stimulation settings in unseen datasets: a priori clinically optimized and stimulation-naïve PD patients. We propose that fMRI brain responses to DBS stimulation in PD patients could represent an objective biomarker of clinical response. Upon further validation with additional studies, these findings may open the door to functional imaging-assisted DBS programming.",NA,26/05/2021,D016430;D016428;D064888;D013485,10.1038/s41467-021-23311-9,NA,1,1,,

Tools to identify patients suitable for community-based management are urgently needed.We prospectively recruited adults presenting to 2 hospitals in India with moderate symptoms of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 to develop and validate a clinical prediction model to rule out progression to supplemental oxygen requirement. The primary outcome was defined as any of the following: SpO2 < 94%; respiratory rate > 30 BPM; SpO2/FiO2 < 400; or death. We specified a priori that each model would contain three clinical parameters (age, sex, and SpO2) and 1 of 7 shortlisted biochemical biomarkers measurable using commercially available rapid tests (C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, interleukin 6 [IL-6], neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], procalcitonin [PCT], soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell-1 [sTREM-1], or soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor [suPAR]), to ensure the models would be suitable for resource-limited settings. We evaluated discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the models in a held-out temporal external validation cohort.In total, 426 participants were recruited, of whom 89 (21.0%) met the primary outcome; 257 participants comprised the development cohort, and 166 comprised the validation cohort. The 3 models containing NLR, suPAR, or IL-6 demonstrated promising discrimination (c-statistics: 0.72-0.74) and calibration (calibration slopes: 1.01-1.05) in the validation cohort and provided greater utility than a model containing the clinical parameters alone.We present 3 clinical prediction models that could help clinicians identify patients with moderate COVID-19 suitable for community-based management.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of smoking status (current smoking and a smoking history) on the clinical severity of COVID-19. Data of all enrolled 588 patients, who were referred to 25 hospitals in Jiangsu province between January 10, 2020 and March 14, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate regression, random forest algorithms, and additive interaction were used to estimate the importance of selective predictor variables in the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 severity. In the univariate analysis, the proportion of patients with a current smoking status in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group. In the multivariate analysis, current smoking remained a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Data from the interaction analysis showed a strong interaction between the number of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 and smoking. However, no significant interaction was found between smoking and specific comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, etc. In the random forest model, smoking history was ranked sixth in mean decrease accuracy. Active smoking may be significantly associated with an enhanced risk of COVID-19 progression towards severe disease. However, additional prospective studies are needed to clarify the complex relationship between smoking and COVID-19 severity.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

However, only a minority of patients experience durable clinical benefit with immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in most disease settings. Spurred by preclinical and correlative studies to understand mechanisms of non-response to the PD-(L)1 antagonists and by combination studies in animal tumor models, many drug development programs were designed to combine anti-PD-(L)1 with a variety of approved and investigational chemotherapies, tumor-targeted therapies, antiangiogenic therapies, and other immunotherapies. Several immunotherapy combinations improved survival outcomes in a variety of indications including melanoma, lung, kidney, and liver cancer, among others. This immunotherapy renaissance, however, has led to many combinations being advanced to late-stage development without definitive predictive biomarkers, limited phase I and phase II data, or clinical trial designs that are not optimized for demonstrating the unique attributes of immune-related antitumor activity-for example, landmark progression-free survival and overall survival. The decision to activate a study at an individual site is investigator-driven, and generalized frameworks to evaluate the potential for phase III trials in immuno-oncology to yield positive data, particularly to increase the number of curative responses or otherwise advance the field have thus far been lacking. To assist in evaluating the potential value to patients and the immunotherapy field of phase III trials, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) has developed a checklist for investigators, described in this manuscript. Although the checklist focuses on anti-PD-(L)1-based combinations, it may be applied to any regimen in which immune modulation is an important component of the antitumor effect.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

The optimal prosthetic valve is not established in this population. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess outcomes of patients with dialysis-dependent ESKD who received mechanical or bioprosthetic valves.We searched Cochrane Central, Medline and Embase from inception to January 2020. We performed screening, full-text assessment, risk of bias and data collection, independently and in duplicate. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.We identified 28 observational studies (n = 9857 patients, including 6680 with mechanical valves and 3717 with bioprosthetic valves) with a median follow-up of 3.45 years. Twenty-two studies were at high risk of bias and 1 was at critical risk of bias from confounding. Certainty in evidence was very low for all outcomes except bleeding. Mechanical valves were associated with reduced mortality at 30 days (relative risk [RR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.97, I 2 = 0, absolute effect 27 fewer deaths per 1000) and at 6 or more years (mean 9.7 yr, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.96, I 2 = 79%, absolute effect 145 fewer deaths per 1000), but increased bleeding (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.46, 95% CI 1.41-4.27, I 2 = 59%, absolute effect 91 more events per 1000) and stroke (IRR 1.63, 95% CI 1.21-2.20, I 2 = 0%, absolute effect 25 more events per 1000).Mechanical valves were associated with reduced mortality, but increased rate of bleeding and stroke. Given very low certainty for evidence of mortality and stroke outcomes, patients and clinicians may choose prosthetic valves based on factors such as bleeding risk and valve longevity.PROSPERO no.

The proof of concept that targeting inflammation reduces cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction has highlighted the urgent need to identify new immunotherapies to treat patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Importantly, emerging data from new clinical trials show that successful immunotherapies for atherosclerosis need to be tailored to the specific immune alterations in distinct groups of patients. In this Review, we discuss how single-cell technologies - such as single-cell mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing - are ideal for mapping the cellular and molecular composition of human atherosclerotic plaques and how these data can aid in the discovery of new precise immunotherapies. We also argue that single-cell data from studies in humans need to be rigorously validated in relevant experimental models, including rapidly emerging single-cell CRISPR screening technologies and mouse models of atherosclerosis. Finally, we discuss the importance of implementing single-cell immune monitoring tools in early phases of drug development to aid in the precise selection of the target patient population for data-driven translation into randomized clinical trials and the successful translation of new immunotherapies into the clinic.© 2021.

Asymptomatic in its initial stages, PDAC is mostly diagnosed late, when already a locally advanced or metastatic disease, as there are no useful biomarkers for detection in its early stages, when surgery can be curative. We have previously described a promising biomarker panel (LYVE1, REG1A, and TFF1) for earlier detection of PDAC in urine. Here, we aimed to establish the accuracy of an improved panel, including REG1B instead of REG1A, and an algorithm for data interpretation, the PancRISK score, in additional retrospectively collected urine specimens. We also assessed the complementarity of this panel with CA19-9 and explored the daily variation and stability of the biomarkers and their performance in common urinary tract cancers.Clinical specimens were obtained from multiple centres: Barts Pancreas Tissue Bank, University College London, University of Liverpool, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Cambridge University Hospital, and University of Belgrade. The biomarker panel was assayed on 590 urine specimens: 183 control samples, 208 benign hepatobiliary disease samples (of which 119 were chronic pancreatitis), and 199 PDAC samples (102 stage I-II and 97 stage III-IV); 50.7% were from female individuals. PDAC samples were collected from patients before treatment. The samples were assayed using commercially available ELISAs. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests adjusted for multiple comparisons, and multiple logistic regression. Training and validation datasets for controls and PDAC samples were obtained after random division of the whole available dataset in a 1:1 ratio. The substitution of REG1A with REG1B enhanced the performance of the panel to detect resectable PDAC. In a comparison of controls and PDAC stage I-II samples, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) increased from 0.900 (95% CI 0.843-0.957) and 0.926 (95% CI 0.843-1.000) in the training (50% of the dataset) and validation sets, respectively, to 0.936 in both the training (95% CI 0.903-0.969) and the validation (95% CI 0.888-0.984) datasets for the new panel including REG1B. This improved panel showed both sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP) to be >85%. Plasma CA19-9 enhanced the performance of this panel in discriminating PDAC I-II patients from controls, with AUC = 0.992 (95% CI 0.983-1.000), SN = 0.963 (95% CI 0.913-1.000), and SP = 0.967 (95% CI 0.924-1.000). We demonstrate that the biomarkers do not show significant daily variation, and that they are stable for up to 5 days at room temperature. The main limitation of our study is the low number of stage I-IIA PDAC samples (n = 27) and lack of samples from individuals with hereditary predisposition to PDAC, for which specimens collected from control individuals were used as a proxy.We have successfully validated our urinary biomarker panel, which was improved by substituting REG1A with REG1B. At a pre-selected cutoff of >80% SN and SP for the affiliated PancRISK score, we demonstrate a clinically applicable risk stratification tool with a binary output for risk of developing PDAC ('elevated' or 'normal').

Intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic acid (HA) injections have been shown to alleviate pain and improve mandibular mobility in patients with TMJ osteoarthritis (OA).The primary aim of the study was to identify the prognostic factors of patient satisfaction for a single IA injection of a mannitol-modified crosslinked HA (HANOX-M-XL) in patients with TMJ-OA. The second goal was to obtain clinical data on effectiveness, safety and mandibular mobility throughout a six-month follow-up period.This was an observational single-arm prospective trial with a six-month follow-up.patients with TMJ-OA which is not relieved by analgesics and/or non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs and/or orthotics, with radiological evidence of TMJ-OA. All patients received a single IA injection of 1 ml HANOX-M-XL in the target TMJ. The primary endpoint was patient satisfaction on day 180. The main secondary outcome measures were pain variation on a 11-point numeric scale (0-11) between the date of injection and month six, the variation over time of the Maximum Inter-Incisal Opening Distance (MIIOD) and the patient's assessment of effectiveness. Predictive factors of success or failure were also studied. All adverse events were recorded.36 subjects (mean age 55.3 years, mean disease duration 98 months), covering a total of 52 injected TMJs, were included. Between baseline and endpoint, the average pain while chewing decreased dramatically from 6.9 ± 1.2 to 2.9 ± 1.3 (p < 0.0001) and the MIIOD increased from 29 ± 7 to 35 ± 5 mm (p < 0.01). On day 180, all patients were satisfied with the treatment, with 34 patients (94%) rating it as highly effective or effective. Tolerability was good in all but one patient. In the multivariate analysis, patient satisfaction on day 180 was highly correlated with the pain while chewing score, pain on palpation score and the decrease of pain over time (all p < 0.0001) but not with MIIOD, gender, age, bruxism, articular noise and symptom duration. Previous viscosupplementation was also related to higher satisfaction (p = 0.01).Despite a long history of pain, most of the patients with symptomatic TMJ-OA benefited from a single injection of HANOX-M-XL, as shown by the sustained (up to 6 months) decrease in pain and improvement in mandibular mobility, with no safety concerns.© 2022.

Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, references, and conference proceedings were manually searched.English-language randomized clinical trials with available data that measured overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or objective response rate comparing immune checkpoint inhibitors, tumor vaccines, or cellular immunotherapy with conventional therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC were included. Thirty-one immunotherapy randomized clinical trials were included, and multicohort data included next-generation sequencing data from patients with advanced NCSLC.Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were pooled to estimate the survival increases in OS and PFS. Dichotomous data, such as object response rate data, were analyzed using the risk ratio. Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model was used. I2 was used to assess the heterogeneity between trials; an I2 value exceeding 50% indicated the existence of substantial heterogeneity. Analyses took place from February 1, 2018, to August 31, 2018.Primary outcomes were OS and PFS.In total, 14 395 patients (9500 [66.0%] men) were included in the meta-analysis, and 1833 patients (mean [SD], 65.2 [9.9] years; 1063 [58.0%] men) were included in the individual patient-level study.

Pembrolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy was found to be the most appropriate first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor regimen for advanced NSCLC, and the combined use of PD-L1 expression and TMB was found to be a promising biomarker to evaluate patients' survival and response to precision immunotherapy. The further combination of CD8+ T-cell tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-L1 expression, and TMB was associated with reliable prognosis.

The age-standardised incidence (ASRi) of CRC in populations in the year of screening was derived from the Cancer Statistics.One hundred sixty-six observational studies and 60 experimental studies were identified. Most studies applied cascade screening with faecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) as an initial test. The adherence to colonoscopy varied greatly across populations by continents, gross national income and type of initial tests, with a median (interquartile range) of 79.8% (63.1%-87.8%) in observational studies and 82.1% (66.7%-90.4%) in randomised trials. The adherence was positively correlated with the ASRi of CRC (r = 0.145, p = 0.023) and positive predictive value (PPV) of the initial tests (r = 0.206, p = 0.002) in observational studies and correlated with ASRi of CRC (r = 0.309, p = 0.002) and sensitivity of the initial tests (r = -0.704, p = 0.003) in experimental studies.Adherence to colonoscopy varies greatly across populations and is related with performance of the initial tests, indicating the importance to select appropriate initial tests.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","c(""# PW2019A-5"", ""Health Commission of Pudong New Area of Shanghai"", """")|c(""Local High Level University Construction Project of Shanghai"", """")",23/03/2022,D016428;D016454,10.1111/ecc.13577,NA,1,1,,

A common protocol is to store buffy coat specimens for future DNA isolation and these may remain in frozen storage for many years. It is uncertain if the DNA remains suitable for modern genome wide association (GWA) genotyping.We isolated DNA from 120 Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial buffy coats sampling a range of storage times up to 9 years and other factors that could influence DNA yield. We performed TaqMan SNP and GWA genotyping to test whether the DNA retained integrity for high quality genetic analysis.We tested two QIAGEN automated protocols for DNA isolation, preferring the Compromised Blood Protocol despite similar yields. We isolated DNA from all 120 specimens (yield range 1.1-312 ug per 8.5 ml ACD tube of whole blood) with only 3/120 samples yielding < 10 ug DNA. Age of participant at blood draw was negatively associated with yield (mean change -2.1 ug/year). DNA quality was very good based on gel electrophoresis QC, TaqMan genotyping of 6 SNPs (genotyping no-call rate 1.1% in 702 genotypes), and excellent quality GWA genotyping data (maximum per sample genotype missing rate 0.64%).When collected as a long term clinical trial or biobank specimen for DNA, buffy coats can be stored for up to 9 years in a -80°C frozen state and still produce high yields of DNA suitable for GWA analysis and other genetic testing.",N01-HC-95180|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|N01-HC-95184|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|IAA-Y1-HC-1010|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|N01-HC-95182|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|N01-HC-95183|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|N01-HC-95178|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|N01-HC-95179|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|N01-HC-95181|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|IAA-Y1-HC-9035|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States,15/06/2011,D016428;D052061;D013485;D013487,10.1186/1479-5876-9-91,NCT00000620,0,0,,

However, most clinical predictors of DMV are based on European and US populations. On the other hand, most predictive models consist of multiple factors and complicated assessments. Since obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is among the most important risk factors associated with DMV, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) may play an important role in determining patient risk.The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between DMV and AHI, and to determine preoperative risk factors for DMV in Chinese patients.A prospective cohort trial enrolled patients scheduled for elective surgery. After obtaining informed consent, patient demographic information was collected, and patients were tested with pre-operative polysomnography. The anesthesiologist who managed the airway graded the mask ventilation. The difficult mask ventilation was defined as the mask ventilation provided by an unassisted anesthesiologist without oral airway or other adjuvant. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between AHI and DMV.A total of 159 patients were analyzed. For both primary and secondary outcomes, the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio for DMV showed significant increases by 5 AHI units. AHI, age, and the Mallampati classification were found to be independent predictive factors for DMV.AHI is associated with DMV as a novel independent risk factor in Chinese patients.

We explored whether adding P could benefit some N- subpopulations and whether to consider de-escalation for some N+ subpopulations.Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) is an exploratory, graphical method that plots estimates of treatment effect for overlapping patient subpopulations defined by a covariate of interest. We used STEPP to estimate Kaplan-Meier differences in 6-year IDFS percentages (P minus Pla: Δ ± standard error [SE]), both overall and by nodal status, for overlapping subpopulations defined by (1) a clinical composite risk score, (2) tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) percentage, and (3) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) FISH copy number. Because of multiplicity, a Δ of at least three SE is required to warrant attention.The average absolute gains in 6-year IDFS percentages were 2.8 ± 0.9 overall; 4.5 ± 1.2 for N+ and 0.1 ± 1.1 for N-. Largest gains were for patients with intermediate clinical composite risk (5.3 ± 1.9 overall; 6.9 ± 2.3 N+; 4.0 ± 3.0 N-), highest TILs percentage (6.3 ± 1.7 overall; 7.4 ± 2.4 N+; 3.2 ± 1.7 N-), and intermediate HER2 copy number (2.8 ± 1.9 overall; 7.4 ± 2.5 N+; -1.3 ± 1.9 N-), but clear evidence indicating a pattern of differential subpopulation treatment effects was lacking.STEPP plots for N- did not identify subpopulations clearly benefiting from adding P, and those for N+ did not identify subpopulations warranting de-escalation.

Best practice has been to cool these patients and control their temperature at a constant value in the range of 32-36 oC for at least 24 h. But the certainty of the evidence for this practice is increasingly being challenged. This review will summarize the evidence on key aspects of temperature control in comatose postcardiac arrest patients.The Targeted Temperature Management 2 (TTM-2) trial documented no difference in 6-month mortality among comatose postcardiac arrest patients managed at 33 oC vs. targeted normothermia. A systematic review and meta-analysis completed by the Advanced Life Support (ALS) Task Force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) concluded that temperature control with a target of 32-34 °C did not improve survival or favourable functional outcome after cardiac arrest. Two observational studies have documented an association between predicted moderate hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury and better outcome with temperature control at 33-34 oC compared with 35-36 oC.We suggest actively preventing fever by targeting a temperature 37.5 oC or less for those patients who remain comatose following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Little is known about the relationship between their consumer behaviour towards footwear and the development of those injuries. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate if consumer behaviour towards footwear is a risk factor for lower extremity injuries.A prospective cohort study was set-up in leisure-time walkers and runners. Potential risk factors in consumer behaviour were obtained by means of a baseline questionnaire related to the acquisition of current walking or running shoes. Information on injuries sustained during a 24 week period after the baseline questionnaire was obtained in 104 runners and 104 walkers using a 2-weekly questionnaire. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for lower extremity injuries in the consumer behaviour.Forty- nine (24%) subjects suffered a self-reported lower extremity injury. 35 injuries occurred in runners and 14 among walkers.Undergoing a gait analysis before buying shoes was associated with an increased occurrence of lower extremity injuries (odds ratio (OR) 4.76). A protective factor was caring a lot about the right fitting of the shoes (OR 0.11).Runners and walkers should pay attention to the correct size when buying footwear to diminish the risk of lower extremity injury. Buying footwear after a gait analysis increased the risk of a lower extremity injury in runners and walkers, however, this might be associated with the increased risk that was already present because of previous injury.This trial was not registered since this was an observational study and no intervention took place.",NA,21/08/2019,D016428;D064888,10.1186/s13047-019-0354-x,NA,1,0,,

Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by comparing the App-diagnoses with the final discharge diagnoses. Timing of diagnosis and time to treatment were correlated with complications, overall survival, and length of hospital stay.In this prospective, double-blinded study, 450 patients were enrolled and followed up until day 90.

To validate an appropriate dosing regimen, this study investigated the pharmacokinetics of intranasal dexmedetomidine in Chinese children under 3 yr old.Intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 µg · kg-1 was administered to children with simple vascular malformations undergoing interventional radiological procedures. A population pharmacokinetic analysis with data from an optimized sparse-sampling design was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Clearance was modeled using allometric scaling and a sigmoid postmenstrual age maturation model. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the different dosing regimens.A total of 586 samples from 137 children aged 3 to 36 months were included in the trial. The data were adequately described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination. Body weight with allometric scaling and maturation function were significant covariates of dexmedetomidine clearance.

Applying this model on BEST3 showed precision of 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) for focal IM pathologies with a class-balanced accuracy of 0.77 (95% CI 0.69-0.84). Using this model, 55% of patients (87/158) in BEST3 would fall below the threshold for clinically relevant BO and could avoid gastroscopy, while only missing 5.1% of patients (8/158).Automated Cytosponge-TFF3 gland quantification may enable thresholds to be set to trigger confirmatory gastroscopy to minimize overdiagnosis of focal IM pathologies with very low cancer-associated risk.Cancer Research UK (12088/16893 and C14478/A21047).Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

A multicenter retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study.,"Surgical failure-to-rescue (FTR, death rate following complications) is a reliable cross-sectional quality of care marker, but has not been evaluated dynamically. We aimed to study changes in FTR following emergency surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.Matched cohort study including all COVID-19-non-infected adult patients undergoing emergency general surgery in 25 Spanish hospitals during COVID-19 pandemic peak (March-April 2020), non-peak (May-June 2020), and 2019 control periods. A propensity score-matched comparative analysis was conducted using a logistic regression model, in which period was regressed on observed baseline characteristics. Subsequently, a mixed effects logistic regression model was constructed for each variable of interest. Main variable was FTR. Secondary variables were post-operative complications, readmissions, reinterventions, and length of stay.5003 patients were included (948, 1108, and 2947 in the pandemic peak, non-peak, and control periods), with comparable clinical characteristics, prognostic scores, complications, reintervention, rehospitalization rates, and length of stay across periods. FTR was greater during the pandemic peak than during non-peak and pre-pandemic periods (22.5% vs. 17.2% and 12.7%), being this difference confirmed in adjusted analysis (odds ratio [OR] 2.13, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.27-3.66). There was sensible inter-hospital variability in FTR changes during the pandemic peak (median FTR change +8.77%, IQR 0-29.17%) not observed during the pandemic non-peak period (median FTR change 0%, IQR -6.01-6.72%). Greater FTR increase was associated with higher COVID-19 incidence (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.31-4.16) and some hospital characteristics, including tertiary level (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.27-8.00), medium-volume (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.14-7.34), and high basal-adjusted complication risk (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.07-4.72).FTR following emergency surgery experienced a heterogeneous increase during different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting it to behave as an indicator of hospital resilience. FTR monitoring could facilitate identification of centres in special needs during ongoing health care challenges.Copyright © 2022 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It originated from the Hubei province in China as a case of pneumonia, later named COVID-19.1 The causative pathogen, a new enveloped betacoronavirus2 is now known as Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV 2). India reported its first case of COVID19, on 30th January 2020. We aim to identify the defining clinical and radiological characteristics, severity and prognosis, along with impact of age on outcome.Cross sectional, observational study of patients diagnosed with COVID -19 [RT-PCR].We observed male predominance, mean age of 36 years, with less or no symptoms, majority brought in after screening and contact tracing by the screening teams. Thrombocytopenia, lymphocytosis, raised LDH was common (>35%, p<0.05). Patients over the age of 60 were the ones having severe illness and more complications (p<0.05). Radiographic abnormality was frequently associated irrespective of clinical presentation and its severity. Poor prognosis was noted in elderly, especially those with co-morbidities.Though the disease has a relatively mild course in this part of the subcontinent, patients aged ≥60 are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Clinical and laboratory findings are similar to those found in viral diseases. Increased risk of cardiac involvement needs to be looked into. Chest X-ray proves sufficient for imaging, reducing the requirement of CT scans.

Participants included adult patients hospitalized between March 1 and May 15, 2020, with COVID-19 and not receiving corticosteroids for chronic use. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to March 2022.Corticosteroid exposure was defined as more than 0.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent in a 24-hour period. For target trial emulation, exposures were corticosteroids for 6 days if and when a patient met criteria for severe hypoxia vs no corticosteroids. For approaches common in clinical literature, treatment definitions used for variables in Cox regression models varied by study design (no time frame, 1 day, and 5 days from time of severe hypoxia).The main outcome was 28-day mortality from time of hospitalization. The association of corticosteroids with mortality for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 was assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) meta-analysis of corticosteroid randomized clinical trials as a benchmark.A total of 3298 patients (median [IQR] age, 65 [53-77] years; 1970 [60%] men) were assessed, including 423 patients who received corticosteroids at any point during hospitalization and 699 patients who died within 28 days of hospitalization. Target trial emulation analysis found corticosteroids were associated with a reduced 28-day mortality rate, from 32.2%; (95% CI, 30.9%-33.5%) to 25.7% (95% CI, 24.5%-26.9%). This estimate is qualitatively identical to the WHO meta-analysis odds ratio of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53-0.82). Hazard ratios using methods comparable with current corticosteroid research range in size and direction, from 0.50 (95% CI, 0.41-0.62) to 1.08 (95% CI, 0.80-1.47).These findings suggest that clinical research based on observational data can be used to estimate findings similar to those from randomized clinical trials; however, the correctness of these estimates requires designing the study and analyzing the data based on principles that are different from the current standard in clinical research.",K23 HL151876|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States,4/10/2022,D016428,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.34425,NA,1,1,,

Given the morbidity of esophagectomy and the possibility of pCR with ChemoRT, a 'watch and wait' strategy has been proposed, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma. The ability to accurately predict which patients will have pCR from ChemoRT is critical in treatment decision making. This study assessed positron emission tomography (PET) in predicting pCR after neoadjuvant ChemoRT for ESCC.ESCC patients treated with ChemoRT followed by surgery were identified. Maximum standard uptake value (SUV), metabolic tumor volume, total lesion glycolysis, and first-order textual features of standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness were measured from PET. Univariable and multivariable generalized linear method analyses were performed. A metabolic complete response (mCR) was defined as a post-therapy PET scan with maximum SUV < 4.0.Twenty-seven patients underwent ChemoRT followed by surgery, with overall pCR seen in 11 (41%) patients and radiographic mCR seen in 12 (44%) patients. Final pathology for these 12 patients revealed pCR (ypT0N0M0) in 5 (42%) patients and persistent disease in 7 (58%) patients. Univariate analysis did not reveal PET parameters predictive of pCR.Treatment of ESCC with ChemoRT often results in a robust clinical response. Among patients with an mCR after ChemoRT, disease persistence was found in 58%. The inability of PET to predict pCR is important in the context of a 'watch and wait' strategy for ESCC treated with ChemoRT.© 2021.

Predictors of unfavorable outcome (UO, Cerebral Performance Category of 3-5 at 3 months) included: a) worst NPi ≤ 2; b) presence of discontinuous encephalography (EEG) background; c) bilateral absence of N20 waves on somatosensory evoked potentials (N20ABS); d) peak neuron-specific enolase (NSE) blood levels > 60 mcg/L; e) myoclonus, which were all tested in a subset of patients who underwent complete multimodal assessment (MMM).A total of 269/456 (59 %) patients had UO and 186 (41 %) underwent MMM. The presence of myoclonus was assessed in all patients, EEG in 358 (78 %), N20 in 186 (41 %) and NSE measurement in 228 (50 %). Patients with discontinuous EEG, N20ABS or high NSE had a higher proportion of worst NPi ≤ 2. The accuracy for NPi to predict a discontinuous EEG, N20ABS, high NSE and the presence of myoclonus was moderate. Concordance with NPi ≤ 2 was high for NSE, and moderate for discontinuous EEG and N20ABS. Also, the higher the number of concordant predictors of poor outcome, the lower the observed NPi.In this study, NPi ≤ 2 had moderate to high concordance with other unfavorable outcome prognosticators of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. This indicates that NPi measurement could be considered as a valid tool for coma prognostication after cardiac arrest.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the correlation between QFR and FFRCT is not fully investigated in patients with complex coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation and agreement between QFR and FFRCT in patients with de novo three-vessel disease and/or left main CAD.This is a post-hoc sub-analysis of the international, multicenter, and randomized SYNTAX III REVOLUTION trial, in which both invasive coronary angiography and coronary computed tomography angiography were prospectively obtained prior to the heart team discussion. QFR was performed in an independent core laboratory and compared with FFRCT analyzed by HeartFlow™. The correlation and agreement between QFR and FFRCT were assessed per vessel. Furthermore, independent factors of diagnostic discordance between QFR and FFRCT were evaluated.Out of 223 patients, 40 patients were excluded from this analysis due to the unavailability of FFRCT and/or QFR, and a total of 469 vessels (183 patients) were analyzed. There was a strong correlation between QFR and FFRCT (R ​= ​0.759; p ​< ​0.001), and the Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a mean difference of -0.005 and a standard deviation of 0.116.

For those who survive, the level of care required on discharge from hospital is unknown and such information could guide decision-making. The ELF (Emergency Laparotomy and Frailty) study aimed to determine whether preoperative frailty in older adults was associated with increased dependence at the time of discharge.The ELF study was a UK-wide multicentre prospective cohort study of older patients (65 years or more) undergoing emergency laparotomy during March and June 2017. The objective was to establish whether preoperative frailty was associated with increased care level at discharge compared with preoperative care level. The analysis used a multilevel logistic regression adjusted for preadmission frailty, patient age, sex and care level.A total of 934 patients were included from 49 hospitals. Mean(s.d.) age was 76·2(6·8) years, with 57·6 per cent women; 20·2 per cent were frail. Some 37·4 per cent of older adults had an increased care level at discharge. Increasing frailty was associated with increased discharge care level, with greater predictive power than age. The adjusted odds ratio for an increase in care level was 4·48 (95 per cent c.i. 2·03 to 9·91) for apparently vulnerable patients (Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) 4), 5·94 (2·54 to 13·90) for those mildly frail (CFS 5) and 7·88 (2·97 to 20·79) for those moderately or severely frail (CFS 6 or 7), compared with patients who were fit.Over 37 per cent of older adults undergoing emergency laparotomy required increased care at discharge.

NPi quantifies the PLR and ranges from 0 to 5; in healthy individuals, the NPi of both eyes is expected to be ≥ 3.0 and symmetric. AIP values demonstrate emerging value as a prognostic tool with predictive properties that could allow practitioners to anticipate neurological deterioration and recovery. The presence of an NPi differential (a difference ≥ 0.7 between the left and right eye) is a potential sign of neurological abnormality.We explored NPi differential by considering the modified Rankin Score at discharge (DC mRS) among patients admitted to neuroscience intensive care units (NSICU) of 4 U.S. and 1 Japanese hospitals and for two cohorts of brain injuries: stroke (including subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, and aneurysm, 1,200 total patients) and 185 traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients for a total of more than 54,000 pupillary measurements.Stroke patients with at least 1 occurrence of an NPi differential during their NSICU stay have higher DC mRS scores (3.9) compared to those without an NPi differential (2.7; P < .001). Patients with TBI and at least 1 occurrence of an NPi differential during their NSICU stay have higher discharge modified Rankin Scale scores (4.1) compared to those without an NPi differential (2.9; P < .001). When patients experience both abnormalities, abnormal (NPi < 3.0) and an NPi differential, the latter has an anticipatory relationship with respect to the former (P < .001 for z-score skewness analysis). Finally, our analysis confirmed ≥ 0.7 as the optimal cutoff value for the NPi differential (AUC = 0.71, P < .001).The NPi differential is an important factor that clinicians should consider when managing critically ill neurological injured patients admitted to the neurocritical care units.NCT02804438 , Date of Registration: June 17, 2016.© 2022.

As such, it has a broad range of clinical applications, which have been independently reported in the literature. This paper aims to present a review of extant literature on the utility of AS-OCT and its efficacy in clinical applications, and to evaluate the quality of available evidence. The following databases were searched from inception to 24 June 2018: Medline via Ovid, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Bibliographies of identified papers were hand searched. Inclusion criteria: articles describing or assessing the use of OCT for visualising the AS. The authors excluded studies without an identified primary outcome variable. One author independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed for risk of bias using PRISMA guidelines. This review included 82 studies, of which there were 11 cohort studies, 37 case series, 10 case studies, 21 comparative observational studies, and three non-systematic review articles. Primary outcome variables included anterior chamber angle, angle opening distance, angle recess area, trabecular iris angle, trabecula-iris space area, corneal thickness, tear meniscus height, tear meniscus area, tear meniscus volume, and the morphology of AS structures, including the ocular surface, blebs, flaps, and graft sites. This review attempts to encompass the breadth and depth of evidence for AS-OCT in the arena of diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognostics. At the same time, it brings to light the dearth of high-level evidence on this topic, suggesting the important role of randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses for the future validation of this technology.© 2019 Optometry Australia.",NA,13/01/2019,D016428;D016454,10.1111/cxo.12869,NA,0,0,,

Off-pump CABG (OPCABG) avoids postoperative complications from the cardiopulmonary bypass, but it is unclear how it is impacted by occult renal dysfunction (ORD). This study aimed to investigate the effects of ORD on early and late outcomes after OPCABG.This retrospective and observational cohort study reviewed data on 1,188 patients who underwent first isolated OPCABG with normal serum creatinine (SCr) levels. According to preoperative estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) by the Cockcroft-Gault formula, the patients were divided into an ORD group (n=260, eCrCl <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and a control group (n=928, eCrCl ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2).The ORD patients presented with older age, higher incidence of small body surface area, hypertension, low preoperative eCrCl, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Ⅲ, and high risk score. The prevalence of hospital mortality, postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), peak postoperative SCr, and prolonged hospital stay were greater in the ORD patients than the control patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the ORD patients were at significantly higher risk of postoperative AKI (OR, 2.702; 95% CI, 1.994-3.662) and in-hospital mortality (OR, 2.884; 95% CI, 1.293-6.432). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models confirmed that ORD was significantly associated with high later mortality (HR, 2.847; 95% CI, 1.262-6.425).Occult renal dysfunction is an independent risk factor for postoperative AKI in-hospital and later mortality in patients undergoing OPCABG with normal SCr levels.Copyright © 2020.

The ESVS guidelines use an expert committee to encourage clinical effectiveness across a range of European health economies. ESVS guideline topics, but not questions, are prospectively identified, assessment of evidence was less rigorous, and 125 recommendations were made. More up to date evidence searches by the ESVS committee partially underscore the differences in recommendations for screening women. The NICE committee did not consider sex specific analysis or evidence for thresholds for intervention but relied on sex specific modelling to support their advice to use endovascular repair (EVAR) for ruptures in women. Their recommendation to use open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in men aged < 71 years was based on in house economic modelling. NICE recommends an open first strategy for non-ruptured AAA mainly based on earlier RCTs and UK specific economic modelling, while the ESVS guidelines recommend an EVAR first strategy after consideration of modern, but lower quality, evidence from observational studies. Similar reasons explain differences in the recommended treatments of juxtarenal aneurysms.Differences between the NICE and ESVS guidelines can be explained, at least in part, by their differing perspectives, methodologies, and quality assurance. Future ESVS guidelines may benefit from more multidisciplinary input and prospectively identified questions.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

A systematic review of literature.","Background: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) products are increasingly endorsed for self-management of multiple ailments, including as opioid substitution. The FDA has expressed that there is no evidence to indicate that this botanical is safe or effective for any medical use.Objective: We systematically review the current state of the literature concerning the impact of kratom and its alkaloids in all paradigms that involve opioids.Methods: A keyword search of online literature databases identified 16 preclinical studies, 25 case reports, and 10 observational studies meeting our pre-selected criteria.Results: All rodent models support alkaloids' action on opioid receptors, translating in their ability to mitigate opioid withdrawal. Some studies found mitragynine (MG) to have less reinforcing properties than morphine, and possessing tolerance-sparing properties when coadministered with morphine. Two studies that assessed 7-hydroxymitragynine (7OHMG) found it to substitute for morphine with potential for tolerance and dependence. Aside from addiction development, case reports outline a variety of confounding toxicities. Ten surveys of users, some conducted with assistance from pro-kratom lobbying organizations, find a high self-reported efficacy as an opioid substitute, with minimal reported adverse effects.Conclusion: With no reported controlled human clinical trials, in the light of rising concerns surrounding kratom's liabilities, there is insufficient evidence to allow any conclusions to be drawn.

Yet, recent meta-analytic evidence indicates that antipsychotic exposure in CHR is relatively widespread and associated with a higher imminent risk of transition to psychosis. Therefore, we undertook this study to better delineate which clinical characteristics of CHR individuals may lead to the choice of antipsychotic prescription and whether it identifies a subgroup at higher risk for conversion to psychosis. Methods: Consecutively referred CHR individuals (N = 717) were assessed for demographic and clinical characteristics and followed up for 3 years (200 did not reach the end of the follow-up time) from 2016 to 2021. The sample was then dichotomized, on the basis of antipsychotic prescription, to prescribed (CHRAP+, n = 492) or not-prescribed (CHRAP-, n = 225) groups, which were subsequently compared for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The risks of conversion to psychosis in CHRAP+ versus CHRAP- groups were tested via survival analysis. Results: Of the 717 CHR individuals, 492 (68.62%) were prescribed antipsychotics; among these antipsychotics, the highest proportion used was for aripiprazole (n = 152), followed by olanzapine (n = 106), amisulpride (n = 76), and risperidone (n = 64). The CHRAP+ group had younger age (t = 2.138, P = .033), higher proportion of female individuals (χ2 = 5.084, P = .024), psychotic symptoms of greater severity (t = 7.910, P < .001), and more impaired general function (t = 5.846, P < .001) than the CHRAP- group. The CHRAP+ group had greater risk for conversion to psychosis (27.0% in the CHRAP+ group vs 10.9% in the CHRAP- group, P < .001). Factors related to positive symptoms were the most likely to influence doctors' decision-making regarding prescripton of antipsychotics, without influence of age, sex, and education levels. Conclusions: Clinicians may prescribe antipsychotics mainly based on the severity of positive and disorganization symptoms of CHR individuals. The CHRAP+ group was associated with a higher risk of conversion to psychosis. In pragmatic terms, this finding indicates that baseline antipsychotic prescription in CHR cohorts is a warning flag for higher incipient risk of psychosis and designates as hyper-CHR subgroup as compared to antipsychotic-naive CHR.

Concerns were raised about the potential for delayed and more severe presentations and an increase in diagnoses such as diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health issues. This multinational observational study aimed to study the number of children presenting to EDs across Europe during the early COVID-19 pandemic and factors influencing this and to investigate changes in severity of illness and diagnoses.Routine health data were extracted retrospectively from electronic patient records of children aged 18 years and under, presenting to 38 EDs in 16 European countries for the period January 2018 to May 2020, using predefined and standardized data domains. Observed and predicted numbers of ED attendances were calculated for the period February 2020 to May 2020. Poisson models and incidence rate ratios (IRRs), using predicted counts for each site as offset to adjust for case-mix differences, were used to compare age groups, diagnoses, and outcomes. Reductions in pediatric ED attendances, hospital admissions, and high triage urgencies were seen in all participating sites. ED attendances were relatively higher in countries with lower SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (IRR 2.26, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.70, p < 0.001) and in children aged <12 months (12 to <24 months IRR 0.86, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.89; 2 to <5 years IRR 0.80, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.82; 5 to <12 years IRR 0.68, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.70; 12 to 18 years IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.74; versus age <12 months as reference group, p < 0.001). The lowering of pediatric intensive care admissions was not as great as that of general admissions (IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.45, p < 0.001). Lower triage urgencies were reduced more than higher triage urgencies (urgent triage IRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.12; emergent and very urgent triage IRR 1.53, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.57; versus nonurgent triage category, p < 0.001). Reductions were highest and sustained throughout the study period for children with communicable infectious diseases. The main limitation was the retrospective nature of the study, using routine clinical data from a wide range of European hospitals and health systems.Reductions in ED attendances were seen across Europe during the first COVID-19 lockdown period. More severely ill children continued to attend hospital more frequently compared to those with minor injuries and illnesses, although absolute numbers fell.ISRCTN91495258 https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN91495258.",ACL-2018-021-007|Department of Health|United Kingdom,27/08/2022,D016428;D064888;D013485,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003974,ISRCTN91495258,1,1,,

The aim of this study is to analyse the association between depressive symptoms and CRC survival at 5 years after diagnosis.This multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study was conducted on a sample of 2602 patients with CRC who completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D) at 5 years of follow-up. Survival was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models.According to our analysis, the prevalence of depressive symptoms after a CRC diagnosis was 23.8%. The Cox regression analysis identified depression as an independent risk factor for survival (HR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.21-1.8), a finding which persisted after adjusting for sex (female: HR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.51-0.76), age (>70 years: HR = 3.78; 95% CI: 1.94-7.36), need for help (yes: HR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.17-1.74), provision of social assistance (yes: HR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.16-1.82), tumour size (T3-T4: HR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.22-1.99), nodule staging (N1-N2: HR = 2.46; 95% CI: 2.04-2.96), and diagnosis during a screening test (yes: HR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.55-0.91).There is a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed with CRC.

Psychotherapy is required for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, contemporary psychotherapy technology intervention techniques are limited to a single intervention, and there is a lack of holistic and complete intervention approaches. Social cognition and interaction training is a comprehensive therapy strategy that has been employed in clinical practice; however, the therapeutic efficacy has been inconsistently reported. As a result, we included controlled clinical trials for meta-analysis in order to carefully assess the efficacy of this therapy.This meta-analysis searched all RCT literatures related to social cognitive interaction training (SCIT) published before April 2022 and assessed the effect of this method in the treatment of schizophrenia. The data in the literatures were combined, and the standardized mean difference (SMD) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to predict the negative symptom score, positive symptom score, PANSS score, and social function score of the patients after treatment.14 RCT studies including 1167 inpatients with schizophrenia were included in this study using a retrospective observational study method, including 590 patients treated with SCIT and 577 patients treated with treatment as usual (TAU). The pooled analysis showed that patients after SCIT had lower negative symptom scores (SMD = -1.66, 95% CI (-2.32, -1.00), P < 0.0001), lower positive symptom scores (MD = -4.03, 95% CI (-7.69, -0.36), P = 0.03), lower PANSS total scores (MD = -6.33, 95% CI (-12.43, -0.23), P = 0.02), and higher social functioning scores (SMD = 0.77, 95% CI (0.34, 1.20), P < 0.001) than those after TAU.Our findings support that SCIT is helpful to improve the relief of symptoms and the improvement of social function in patients with schizophrenia, providing a basis for the application of SCIT in hospitalized patients and community patients, and can guide the treatment and intervention of patients with schizophrenia.Copyright © 2022 Yan Tang et al.",NA,27/08/2022,D016428;D017418;D016454;D000078182;D016441,10.1155/2022/3394978,NA,1,1,,

Dietary supplementation with fish oil (FO) or olive oil (OO) has shown protection against other air pollutants. This study evaluates potential cardiopulmonary benefits of FO or OO supplementation against acute O3 exposure in young healthy adults.Forty-three participants (26 ± 4 years old; 47% female) were randomized to receive 3 g/day of FO, 3 g/day OO, or no supplementation (CTL) for 4 weeks prior to undergoing 2-hour exposures to filtered air and 300 ppb O3 with intermittent exercise on two consecutive days. Outcome measurements included spirometry, sputum neutrophil percentage, blood markers of inflammation, tissue injury and coagulation, vascular function, and heart rate variability. The effects of dietary supplementation and O3 on these outcomes were evaluated with linear mixed-effect models.Compared with filtered air, O3 exposure decreased FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC immediately post exposure regardless of supplementation status. Relative to that in the CTL group, the lung function response to O3 exposure in the FO group was blunted, as evidenced by O3-induced decreases in FEV1 (Normalized CTL -0.40 ± 0.34 L, Normalized FO -0.21 ± 0.27 L) and FEV1/FVC (Normalized CTL -4.67 ± 5.0 %, Normalized FO -1.4 ± 3.18 %) values that were on average 48% and 70% smaller, respectively. Inflammatory responses measured in the sputum immediately post O3 exposure were not different among the three supplementation groups. Systolic blood pressure elevations 20-h post O3 exposure were blunted by OO supplementation.FO supplementation appears to offer protective effects against lung function decrements caused by acute O3 exposure in healthy adults.Published by Elsevier Ltd.",EPA999999|Intramural EPA|United States|P30 ES010126|NIEHS NIH HHS|United States,20/07/2022,D016428;D016449;D013486,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107407,NA,1,1,,

Radiographic abnormality was frequently associated irrespective of clinical presentation and its severity. Poor prognosis was noted in elderly, especially those with co-morbidities.Though the disease has a relatively mild course in this part of the subcontinent, patients aged ≥60 are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality.

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of congenital malformations and the occurrence of age-related comorbid conditions and to determine whether the frequencies of congenital and acquired conditions depend on X chromosome gene dosage, as a function of karyotype subgroup. Design and methods This national retrospective observational cohort study includes 1501 patients. We evaluated the prevalence of congenital malformations and the cumulative incidence of subsequent specific comorbidities at five-year intervals, from the ages of 10 to 30 years, with stratification by karyotype subgroup: 45,X (n = 549), 45,X/46,isoXq (n = 280), 46,X,r(X)/46,XX (n = 106), 45,X/46,XX (n = 221), presence of Y (n = 87). Results Median age was 9.4 (3.7-13.7) years at first evaluation and 16.8 (11.2-21.4) years at last evaluation. Congenital heart (18.9%) malformations were more frequent in 45,X patients, and congenital renal (17.2%) malformations were more frequent in 45,X, 45,X/46,isoXq and 46,X,r(X)/46,XX patients than in those with 45,X/46,XX mosaicism or a Y chromosome (P < 0.0001).

Data-driven modelling approaches (step-wise vs. component-wise gradient boosting on complete and restricted predictor set) were compared to predictor selection by experts (investigators vs. external Delphi survey).Inpatients (≥60 years) scheduled for elective surgery lasting more than 60 min.POD was assessed daily during first five postoperative or post-sedation days with confusion assessment method for intensive and standard care unit (CAM-ICU/CAM), 4 'A's test (4AT) and Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) scale.From 1023 enrolled patients, 978 completed observations were separated in development (n = 600; POD incidence 22.2%) and validation (n = 378; POD incidence 25.7%) cohorts. Data-driven approaches generated models containing laboratory values, surgical discipline and several items on cognitive and quality of life assessment, which are time consuming to collect. Boosting on complete predictor set yielded the highest bootstrapped prediction accuracy (AUC 0.767) by selecting 12 predictors, with substantial dependence on cardiac surgery. Investigators selected via univariate comparison age, ASA and NYHA classification, surgical risk as well as ´serial subtraction´ and ´sentence repetition´ of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to enable rapid collection of their risk score for preoperative screening. This investigator model provided slightly lower bootstrapped prediction accuracy (AUC 0.746) but proved to have robust results on validation cohort (AUC 0.725) irrespective of surgical discipline. Simplification of the investigator model by scaling and rounding of regression coefficients into the PROPDESC score achieved a comparable precision on the validation cohort (AUC 0.729).The PROPDESC score showed promising performance on a separate validation cohort in predicting POD based on routine preoperative data.

Our aim was to develop a capnography-based, point-of-care tool that can estimate the level of obstruction in patients with asthma and COPD.Two prospective observational studies conducted between September 2016 and May 2018 at Rabin Medical Center, Israel, included healthy, asthma and COPD patient groups. Each patient underwent spirometry test and continuous capnography, as part of, either methacholine challenge test for asthma diagnosis or bronchodilator reversibility test for asthma and COPD routine evaluation. Continuous capnography signal, divided into single breaths waveforms, were analyzed to identify waveform features, to create a predictive model for FEV1 using an artificial neural network. The gold standard for comparison was FEV1 measured with spirometry.Overall 160 patients analyzed. Model prediction included 32/88 waveform features and three demographic features (age, gender and height). The model showed excellent correlation with FEV1 (R = 0.84), R2 achieved was 0.7 with mean square error of 0.13.In this study we have developed a model to evaluate FEV1 in asthma and COPD patients.

Patients with persistent NOAF (HR: 5.81, 95% CI: 3.59-9.41) were at significantly higher risk of HF hospitalization when compared with those with transient one (HR: 2.61, 95% CI: 1.84-3.70, P interaction = 0.008). Although post-MI NOAF was significantly related to cardiovascular death (annual incidence rates for NOAF and sinus rhythm were 9.4% and 2.3%, respectively; HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.36-2.85, P < 0.001), such an association was attenuated when HF hospitalization (modelled as a time-varying covariate) and antithrombotic treatment were adjusted (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.92-2.02, P = 0.121).In patients with AMI, NOAF is strongly associated with an increased long-term risk of HF hospitalization. Our findings suggest that strengthened secondary prevention of HF should be considered in this high-risk population.© 2020 The Authors.

The eGFR was calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), CKD Epidemiology Collaboration-creatinine, CKD Epidemiology Collaboration-Cys-C, CKD Epidemiology Collaboration-Cys-C-creatinine and a modified abbreviated MDRD (c-aGFR) equations in Chinese CKD patients. Patients were excluded if the eGFR could not be obtained by one of the formulas. Patients were categorized as having normal renal function, mild RD, moderate RD, severe RD, or kidney failure to compare prognosis. The primary outcome was the in-hospital net adverse clinical events (NACE). The secondary outcomes were NACE and all-cause death during follow-up.In total, 2159 NSTE-ACS patients (age: 64.23 ± 10.25 years; males: 73.7%) were enrolled. 39 (1.8%) patients with in-hospital NACE were observed. During the 3.23 ± 1.55-year follow-up, 1.7% death and 4.2% NACE were observed in 1 year. The percentage of severe RD patients ranged from 15.4 to 39.2% according to different calculation formulas. A high prevalence of in-hospital NACE was observed in the severe RD groups (ranging from 8 to 14.3% for different formulas). Multiple regression analysis showed that a high eGFR is a protect factor against NACE and all-cause death regardless of the formula use. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed similar predictive performance of the c-aGFR when compared to other formulas (in-hospital NACE: AUC = 0.612, follow-up NACE: AUC = 0.622, and follow-up death: AUC = 0.711).Severe RD results in a high prevalence of in-hospital NACE in NSTE-ACS patients after PCI regardless of the formulas use. Different formulas have a similar ability to predict in-hospital and long-term prognosis in NSTE-ACS patients.

Subclinical atherosclerosis determined by carotid ultrasound included assessment of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and plaque detection.639 AS and 167 nr-axSpA patients were recruited. CV risk factors (CRF) and several disease-related factors showed a statistically significant association with subclinical atherosclerosis in the crude analysis. After adjustment for age, sex, and smoking (model 1), associations remained statistically significant for spinal mobility, inflammatory bowel disease, use of prednisone, and Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) when assessing carotid plaques and for acute phase reactants (APR) at diagnosis, use of prednisone, DMARD, and TNF-inhibitors when measuring cIMT. In model 2, which also included classic CRF as confounding factors to identify axSpA features with a potential independent pro-atherogenic effect, the functional status was the only variable significantly associated with plaques and the use of prednisone and APR at diagnosis with cIMT. No association differences were found between both subtypes of patients. Besides, APR at diagnosis were also associated with subsequent development of CV events that had occurred in 33 patients.Apart from CRF, atherosclerotic disease in AxSpA is associated with disease-related factors such as inflammatory response and disease severity, with no differences between AS and nr-axSpA.Copyright © 2022.

The volunteers underwent LSM by STE and supersonic shear imaging (SSI) or by STQ and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI). CHB patients underwent liver biopsy and LSM by both STE/STQ. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for staging fibrosis were calculated. Overall, 97 volunteers and 524 CHB patients were finally eligible for the study. The successful STE and STQ measurement rates were both 100 % in volunteers and 99.4 % in CHB patients. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the intra-observer stability of STE and STQ (0.94; 0.90) were similar to those of SSI and ARFI (0.95; 0.87), respectively. STE and STQ showed better accuracy than the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) (AUC: 0.87 vs 0.86 vs 0.73 vs 0.77) in staging cirrhosis.

The goal of this study is to measure the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) in all 3 major coronary vessels to identify the clinical and angiographic predictors of an abnormal IMR.Ninety-three patients who underwent coronary physiological assessment in all 3 major coronary vessels were prospectively enrolled (59.8±9.4 years with 77.4% men). IMR was corrected using Yong's formula and coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) was defined using vessel-specific cutoffs. A global IMR was calculated as the sum of the IMR in all 3 major epicardial vessels. Angiographic epicardial disease severity was assessed with vessel-specific and overall SYNTAX score. Median IMR and fractional flow reserve was 17.2 (Q1-Q3: 13.3-22.9) and 0.92 (0.85-0.97). The majority of patients (59.1%) had no CMD, 23.7% had 1-vessel CMD, 14.0% had 2-vessel CMD, and 3.2% had 3-vessel CMD. CMD was observed at a similar rate in the territories supplied by all 3 major coronary vessels (left anterior descending coronary artery 28.0%, left circumflex artery 19.4%, and right coronary artery 23.7%; P=0.39). Fractional flow reserve had a weak, positive correlation with IMR (ρ=0.16; P<0.01). The SYNTAX score had no significant correlation with IMR, both at a patient level (ρ=-0.002; P=0.99) and a vessel-specific level (ρ=-0.06; P=0.36). By multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis, no variable was left as an independent predictor of an abnormal IMR.Clinical factors and epicardial coronary disease severity are not predictors of the extent of CMD.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

We compare nodal staging accuracy of 18F-ethyl-choline-(FEC)-PET/CT, 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose-(FDG)-PET/CT, and diffusion-weighted-MRI (DW-MRI) with conventional morphologic MRI.A prospective, multicenter observational study of diagnostic accuracy for nodal metastases was undertaken in 5 gyne-oncology centers. FEC-PET/CT, FDG-PET/CT, and DW-MRI were compared with nodal size and morphology on MRI. Reference standard was strictly correlated nodal histology. Eligibility included operable cervical cancer stage ≥ 1B1 or endometrial cancer (grade 3 any stage with myometrial invasion or grade 1-2 stage ≥ II).Among 162 consenting participants, 136 underwent study DW-MRI and FDG-PET/CT and 60 underwent FEC-PET/CT. In 118 patients, 267 nodal regions were strictly correlated at histology (nodal positivity rate, 25%). Sensitivity per patient (n = 118) for nodal size, morphology, DW-MRI, FDG- and FEC-PET/CT was 40%*, 53%, 53%, 63%*, and 67% for all cases (*, P = 0.016); 10%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 25% in cervical cancer (n = 40); 65%, 75%, 70%, 80% and 88% in endometrial cancer (n = 78). FDG-PET/CT outperformed nodal size (P = 0.006) and size ratio (P = 0.04) for per-region sensitivity. False positive rates were all <10%.All imaging techniques had low sensitivity for detection of nodal metastases and cannot replace surgical nodal staging. The performance of FEC-PET/CT was not statistically different from other techniques that are more widely available. FDG-PET/CT had higher sensitivity than size in detecting nodal metastases. False positive rates were low across all methods. The low false positive rate demonstrated by FDG-PET/CT may be helpful in arbitration of challenging surgical planning decisions.©2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.",12783|Cancer Research UK|United Kingdom|C1519/A16463|Department of Health [UK]||C444/A15953|Cancer Research UK|United Kingdom,17/09/2021,D016428;D016448;D064888;D013485,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1834,NA,1,1,,

Insulin-treated women having family history of diabetes represented the subgroup with the highest PPD risk (OR 5.57, 95% CI 3.60-8.63) compared to the reference class (women on diet with pre-pregnancy BMI <  = 28.1 kg/m2). Insulin-treated women without family diabetes history and women on diet with pre-pregnancy BMI > 28.1 kg/m2 showed a two-fold PPD risk. Previous GDM and socioeconomic status represent additional predictors. Fasting more than post-prandial glycemia plays a predictive role, with values of 81-87 mg/dl (4.5-4.8 mmol/l) (lower than the current diagnostic GDM threshold) being associated with PPD risk.Increasing compliance to postpartum OGTT to prevent/delay PPD is a priority.

The discriminative capacity of FRAX® was analyzed by the Area Under Curve (AUC), Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The predictive capacity was determined using the ratio of observed fractures/expected fractures by FRAX® (ObsFx/ExpFx).The study subjects were 770 women from 40 to 90 years of age in the FRIDEX cohort.

Using topological data analysis, we have previously shown that mean arterial pressure (MAP) during SCI surgery predicts long-term functional recovery in rodent models, motivating the present multicenter study in patients.Intra-operative monitoring records and neurological outcome data were extracted (n = 118 patients). We built a similarity network of patients from a low-dimensional space embedded using a non-linear algorithm, Isomap, and ensured topological extraction using persistent homology metrics. Confirmatory analysis was conducted through regression methods.Network analysis suggested that time outside of an optimum MAP range (hypotension or hypertension) during surgery was associated with lower likelihood of neurological recovery at hospital discharge.

We collected blood samples for liquid biopsy at diagnosis, intermediate stage, and progressive disease. Tissue and liquid biopsies were examined using Cobas ® EGFR Mutation Test v2.Liquid biopsy detected EGFR mutations in 63.6% of the patients at diagnosis. The presence of metastasis in the extrathoracic, brain, and adrenal glands correlated positively with the detection of EGFR mutations. Patients with positive EGFR mutations at diagnosis had significantly shorter overall and progression-free survival than patients with negative EGFR mutations. Four of the 18 patients (22.2%) who reached progressive disease had positive EGFR T790M mutations. Three of 10 patients (30.0%) with progressive disease were positive and negative for T790M using tumor re-biopsy and liquid biopsy, respectively. The results of EGFR mutation by tissue re-biopsy were the same as those of liquid biopsy in the three patients who were positive for significant EGFR mutations but negative for the T790M mutation using liquid biopsy at progressing disease. Only two patients were positive for major EGFR mutations at intermediate levels.Liquid biopsy can be a prognostic factor in EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments at diagnosis. Tumor re-biopsy can be omitted in patients with positive EGFR mutations by liquid biopsy at PD.© 2022. The Author(s).",NA,4/10/2022,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1186/s12885-022-10135-z,NA,1,1,,

To measure the levels of Aβ seeding activity in the plasma samples, we have developed an AD-seeds protein analyzer. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to quantify the ability of plasma Aβ seeding activity to distinguish between AD and NADD or NC individuals. Spearman's correlation was used to examine the associations between plasma Aβ seeding activity and global cognitive function or conventional AD biomarkers.The Aβ seeding activities were 0.83 (0.58-1.16) A.U. in AD, 0.42 (0.04-0.74) A.U. in NADD and 0.42 (0.09-0.69) A.U. in NC, respectively. The Aβ seeding activity was able to identify AD patients and distinguish them from NC or NADD with high accuracy (AUC = 0.85-0.86). In addition, the plasma Aβ seeding activity showed a strong correlation with cognitive performance (mini-mental state examination, r = - 0.188; Montreal cognitive assessment, r = - 0.189; clinical dementia rating, r = 0.205) and conventional biomarkers (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Aβ42/40, r = -0.227; CSF T-tau/Aβ42, r = 0.239; CSF P-tau/Aβ42, r = 0.259).Our results confirmed that plasma Aβ seeding activity is an antibody-free and low-cost biomarker for the diagnosis of AD.Trial registration number NCT04850053.© 2022.

Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with positive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). CT visual quantitative evaluation was based on summing up the acute lung inflammatory lesions involving each lobe, which was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), or 4 (76-100%), respectively. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores. The consistency of two observers was evaluated. The TSS was compared with the clinical classification. ROC was used to test the diagnosis ability of TSS for severe-critical type.This study included 78 patients, 38 males and 40 females. There were 24 mild (30.8%), 46 common (59.0%), and 8 severe-critical (10.2%) cases, respectively. The median TSS of severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than common type (p < 0.001).

The possibility of comparing data across different settings depends on the systematic and reproducible manner in which the scans are analyzed and reported. The COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) and the corresponding CT severity score (CTSS) introduced by the Radiological Society of the Netherlands (NVvR) attempt to do so. However, this system has not been externally validated.We aimed to prospectively validate the CO-RADS as a COVID-19 diagnostic tool at the ED and to evaluate whether the CTSS is associated with prognosis.We conducted a prospective, observational study in two tertiary centers in The Netherlands, between March 19 and May 28, 2020. We consecutively included 741 adult patients at the ED with suspected COVID-19, who received a chest CT and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR (PCR). Diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated for CO-RADS, using PCR as reference. Logistic regression was performed for CTSS in relation to hospital admission, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality.Seven hundred forty-one patients were included. We found an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 (CI, 0.89-0.94) for CO-RADS using PCR as reference. The optimal CO-RADS cutoff was 4, with a sensitivity of 89.4% (CI, 84.7-93.0) and specificity of 87.2% (CI, 83.9-89.9).

The HEART score is reportedly a reliable work-up strategy that combines clinical evaluation with troponin value. A clinical rule that could select very low-risk patients without the need for a blood test (HEAR score, being the HEART score without the troponin item) would be of great interest.To prospectively assess the safety of a HEAR score <2 to rule-out non-STEMI without troponin measurement. Secondary objective was to assess the safety of a sequential strategy that combines HEAR score and HEART (defined as two-step HEART strategy).Prospective observational study in six emergency departments. Patients with nontraumatic chest pain and no alternative diagnosis were included and followed up for 45 day. Patients were considered at low-risk if the HEAR score was <2 or, for the two-step HEART strategy, if the HEART score was <4.The primary endpoint was the 45-day rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with a HEAR score <2. A HEAR score based strategy was consider safe if the rate of the primary endpoint was below 1%, with an upper margin of the 95% confidence interval (CI) below 3%.Among 1452 patients included, 1402 were analyzed and 97 (7%) had a MACE during the follow-up period. The HEAR score was <2 in 279 (20%) patients and one presented a MACE [0.4% (95% CI: 0.01-1.98)]. The two-step HEART strategy classified low-risk an additional 476 patients (34%) and one of these 476 patients had a MACE [0.3% (95% CI: 0.03-0.95)]. The two-step HEART strategy would have theoretically avoided 360 troponin measurements (19%).In our prospective multicenter study, a HEAR based work-up strategy was safe, with a very low risk of MACE at 45 day.

We present an emulation trial from observational data to compare effectiveness of Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (BAM/ETE) and Casirivimab/Imdevimab (CAS/IMD) in outpatients with early mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in a real-world scenario of variants of concern (VoCs) from Alpha to Delta.Allocation to treatment was subject to mAbs availability, and the measured factors were not used to determine which combination to use.

Viral load was measured by cycle threshold (CT) on D1 (baseline) and D7.Primary outcome was time to COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause over days 0-30. Weighted pooled logistic regression and marginal structural Cox model by inverse probability weights were used to compare BAM/ETE vs. CAS/IMD. ANCOVA was used to compare mean D7 CT values by intervention. Models were adjusted for calendar month, MASS score and VoCs. We evaluated effect measure modification by VoCs, vaccination, D1 CT levels and enrolment period.COVID19-related hospitalization or death from any cause occurred in 15 of 237 patients in the BAM/ETE group (6.3%) and in 4 of 196 patients in the CAS/IMD group (2.0%) (relative risk reduction [1 minus the relative risk] 72%; p=0.024). Subset analysis carried no evidence that the effect of the intervention was different across stratification factors. There was no evidence in viral load reduction from baseline through day 7 across the two groups (+0.17, 95% -1.41;+1.74, p=0.83).

We hypothesize that changes in Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), and Electroencephalography (EEG) correlated with clinical data and processed by artificial intelligence (AI) can indicate the development of imminent cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, respectively. This study aimed to develop a method that enables detection of imminent cerebral ischemia in unconscious patients, noninvasively and with the support of AI.This prospective observational study will include patients undergoing elective surgery for carotid endarterectomy and patients undergoing acute endovascular embolectomy for cerebral arterial embolism. HRV, NIRS, and EEG measurements and clinical information on patient status will be collected and processed using machine learning. The study will take place at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Inclusion will start in September 2020, and patients will be included until a robust model can be constructed. By analyzing changes in HRV, EEG, and NIRS measurements in conjunction with cerebral ischemia or cerebral reperfusion, it should be possible to train artificial neural networks to detect patterns of impending cerebral ischemia. The analysis will be performed using machine learning with long short-term memory artificial neural networks combined with convolutional layers to identify patterns consistent with cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.Early signs of cerebral ischemia could be detected more rapidly by identifying patterns in integrated, continuously collected physiological data processed by AI. Clinicians could then be alerted, and appropriate actions could be taken to improve patient outcomes.2020 The Authors.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore factors associated with extubation failure in ventilated patients who passed a spontaneous breathing trial and underwent planned extubation. This systematic review was registered in PROPERO with the Registration ID CRD42019137003.We searched the PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials for studies published from January 1998 to December 2018. We included observational studies involving risk factors associated with extubation failure in adult intensive care unit patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the validity of included studies.Sixty-seven studies (involving 26,847 participants) met the inclusion criteria and were included in our meta-analysis. We analyzed 49 variables and, among them, we identified 26 factors significantly associated with extubation failure. Risk factors were distributed into three domains (comorbidities, acute disease severity and characteristics at time of extubation) involving mainly three functions (circulatory, respiratory and neurological). Among these, the physiological respiratory characteristics at time of extubation were the most represented. The individual topic of secretion management was the one with the largest number of variables. By Bayesian multivariable meta-analysis, twelve factors were significantly associated with extubation failure: age, history of cardiac disease, history of respiratory disease, Simplified Acute Physiologic Score II score, pneumonia, duration of mechanical ventilation, heart rate, Rapid Shallow Breathing Index, negative inspiratory force, lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio, lower hemoglobin level and lower Glasgow Coma Scale before extubation, with the latest factor having the strongest association with extubation outcome.Numerous factors are associated with extubation failure in critically ill patients who have passed a spontaneous breathing trial. Robust multiparametric clinical scores and/or artificial intelligence algorithms should be tested based on the selected independent variables in order to improve the prediction of extubation outcome in the clinical scenario.© 2021.

Complications due to vascular compromise often require revision surgery or flap removal. We present hyperspectral imaging (HSI) as a new tool in flap monitoring to improve sensitivity compared to established monitoring tools.We performed a prospective observational cohort study including 22 patients. Flap perfusion was assessed by standard clinical parameters, Doppler ultrasound, and HSI on t0 (0 h), t1 (16-28 h postoperatively), and t2 (39-77 h postoperatively). HSI records light spectra from 500 to 1000 nm and provides information on tissue morphology, composition, and physiology. These parameters contain tissue oxygenation (StO2), near-infrared perfusion- (NIR PI), tissue hemoglobin- (THI), and tissue water index (TWI).Total flap loss was seen in n = 4 and partial loss in n = 2 cases. Every patient with StO2 or NIR PI below 40 at t1 had to be revised. No single patient with StO2 or NIR PI above 40 at t1 had to be revised. Significant differences between feasable (StO2 = 49; NIR PI = 45; THI = 16; TWI = 56) and flaps with revision surgery [StO2 = 28 (p < 0.001); NIR PI = 26 (p = 0.002); THI = 56 (p = 0.002); TWI = 47 (p = 0.045)] were present in all HSI parameters at t1 and even more significant at t2 (p < 0.0001).HSI provides valuable data in free flap monitoring. The technique seems to be superior to the gold standard of flap monitoring. StO2 and NIR PI deliver the most valuable data and 40 could be used as a future threshold in surgical decision making.

A potential solution is a teleophthalmology digital referral pathway linking community optometry and HES.The HERMES study (Teleophthalmology-enabled and artificial intelligence-ready referral pathway for community optometry referrals of retinal disease: a cluster randomised superiority trial with a linked diagnostic accuracy study) is a cluster randomised clinical trial for evaluating the effectiveness of a teleophthalmology referral pathway between community optometry and HES for retinal diseases. Nested within HERMES is a diagnostic accuracy study, which assesses the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) decision support system (DSS) for automated diagnosis and referral recommendation. A postimplementation, observational substudy, a within-trial economic evaluation and discrete choice experiment will assess the feasibility of implementation of both digital technologies within a real-life setting. Patients with a suspicion of retinal disease, undergoing eye examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, will be recruited across 24 optometry practices in the UK. Optometry practices will be randomised to standard care or teleophthalmology. The primary outcome is the proportion of false-positive referrals (unnecessary HES visits) in the current referral pathway compared with the teleophthalmology referral pathway. OCT scans will be interpreted by the AI DSS, which provides a diagnosis and referral decision and the primary outcome for the AI diagnostic study is diagnostic accuracy of the referral decision made by the Moorfields-DeepMind AI system. Secondary outcomes relate to inappropriate referral rate, cost-effectiveness analyses and human-computer interaction (HCI) analyses.Ethical approval was obtained from the London-Bromley Research Ethics Committee (REC 20/LO/1299).

Consecutive ≥75-year-old candidates for elective CRC surgery were enrolled from October 2017 to August 2019. Patients underwent standardized preoperative geriatric assessment including the MPI. Patients with MPI score > 0.33 were classified as frail. Logistic regression models were employed to evaluate variables associated with major postoperative complications and mortality, using 10-fold cross-validated LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for model selection.In all, 104 patients were included, 34 (33%) had MPI score > 0.33. Major postoperative complications occurred in 52% of frail versus 16% of fit (MPI score ≤ 0.33) patients (p < .01). Both 30-day (9% vs. 0%; p = .033) and 90-day mortality (18% vs. 1%; p < .01) were higher among frail patients. In multivariate analysis, MPI score was associated with adverse outcomes. A final postoperative complication predictive model was created, including MPI score, gait-speed test, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) score, surgical approach, and stoma creation.MPI score is strongly associated with postoperative major complications in CRC elderly patients and it is a primary component of an individual prediction model.© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",NA,26/11/2020,D016428;D016448,10.1002/jso.26314,NA,1,1,0,"matches scope of NCT, PI is author"

Its complexity and high in-hospital mortality may justify the need for invasive monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC).Patients with CS included in the CardShock Study, an observational, prospective, multicenter, European registry, were analyzed, aiming to describe the real-world use of PAC, evaluate its impact on 30-day mortality, and the ability of different hemodynamic parameters to predict outcomes.Pulmonary artery catheter was used in 82 (37.4%) of the 219 patients. Cardiogenic shock patients who managed with a PAC received more frequently treatment with inotropes and vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and mechanical assist devices (P < .01). Overall 30-day mortality was 36.5%. Pulmonary artery catheter use did not affect mortality even after propensity score matching analysis (hazard ratio = 1.17 [0.59-2.32], P = .66). Cardiac index, cardiac power index (CPI), and stroke volume index (SVI) showed the highest areas under the curve for 30-day mortality (ranging from 0.752-0.803) and allowed for a significant net reclassification improvement of 0.467 (0.083-1.180), 0.700 (0.185-1.282), 0.683 (0.168-1.141), respectively, when added to the CardShock risk score.In our contemporary cohort of CS, over one-third of patients were managed with a PAC.

Progesterone drives expansion of luminal progenitor cells, leading to the development of poor-prognostic breast cancers. However, it is not known if antagonising progesterone can prevent breast cancers in humans. We suggest that targeting progesterone signalling could be a means of reducing features which are known to promote breast cancer formation.In healthy premenopausal women with and without a BRCA mutation we studied (i) estrogen and progesterone levels in saliva over an entire menstrual cycle (n = 20); (ii) cancer-free normal breast-tissue from a control population who had no family or personal history of breast cancer and equivalently from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (n = 28); triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) biopsies and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the TNBC in the same individuals (n = 14); and biopsies of ER+ve/PR+ve stage T1-T2 cancers and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the cancer in the same individuals (n = 31); and (iii) DNA methylation and DNA mutations in normal breast tissue (before and after treatment) from clinical trials that assessed the potential preventative effects of vitamins and antiprogestins (mifepristone and ulipristal acetate; n = 44).Daily levels of progesterone were higher throughout the menstrual cycle of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, raising the prospect of targeting progesterone signalling as a means of cancer risk reduction in this population. Furthermore, breast field cancerization DNA methylation signatures reflective of (i) the mitotic age of normal breast epithelium and (ii) the proportion of luminal progenitor cells were increased in breast cancers, indicating that luminal progenitor cells with elevated replicative age are more prone to malignant transformation. The progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone reduced both the mitotic age and the proportion of luminal progenitor cells in normal breast tissue of all control women and in 64% of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. These findings were validated by an alternate progesterone receptor antagonist, ulipristal acetate, which yielded similar results. Importantly, mifepristone reduced both the TP53 mutation frequency as well as the number of TP53 mutations in mitotic-age-responders.These data support the potential usage of antiprogestins for primary prevention of poor-prognostic breast cancers.Clinical trial 1 Mifepristone treatment prior to insertion of a levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system for improved bleeding control - a randomized controlled trial, clinicaltrialsregister.eu, 2009-009014-40 ; registered on 20 July 2009.

However, it is not clear whether FMR is just a consequence of left ventricular (LV) remodelling or a factor contributing to cardiomyopathy progression. There will be more clarity about this controversy when the effects of FMR correction on outcomes will be shown. FMR correction can be performed surgically or, more often, percutaneously with the MitraClip procedure. MitraClip is the most widely used device with more than 70 000 implants performed to date. Observational studies suggest that MitraClip treatment of FMR is safe and associated with improved symptoms, quality of life and functional status in HF patients. Two recently randomized controlled clinical trials have investigated the impact of MitraClip on the outcomes of HF patients: Percutaneous Repair with the MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation (MITRA-FR) and Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT). Both trials randomized patients to MitraClip plus guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) or GDMT alone. No reduction in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations was shown in MITRA-FR, whereas a significant reduction in HF hospitalizations (primary endpoint) as well as in mortality alone were shown in COAPT. The aim of this review is to summarize the pathophysiology, prevalence, prognostic role and management of FMR, focusing on the differences between MITRA-FR and COAPT and trying to provide possible explanations for the diverging results. We speculate that the two trials should be interpreted as complementary rather than opposite. Patients with severe FMR (effective regurgitant orifice area > 30 mm2 ) despite maximum tolerated GDMT (including cardiac resynchronization therapy), and without too advanced cardiomyopathy seem to be the best candidates for MitraClip treatment. MITRA-FR and COAPT provide us a long awaited 'proof of concept': FMR may be considered a leading actor in cardiomyopathy progression rather than a mere marker of severity.© 2019 The Authors.

Careful imaging or biomarker surveillance during chemotherapy can identify CTRCD before the development of heart failure. Currently, this surveillance is performed using ejection fraction (EF). While this is a reliable and reproducible test with three-dimensional techniques, the most widely used imaging technique is two-dimensional echocardiography, for which EF measurements have broad confidence intervals.The use of global myocardial strain (GLS) provides a more reliable and reproducible means of assessing global cardiac function and shows meaningful changes before a significant change of EF. Observational studies have shown that although absolute measurements of GLS, both at baseline and during therapy, are predictive of CTRCD risk, the most reliable approach is to assess the change of GLS with therapy - a meaningful relative change of 10-15% being significant. A clinical trial comparing GLS to EF surveillance did not show a significant change of EF in the overall study group, but did show that patients managed with a the GLS-guided approach were less likely to develop a meaningful change of cardiac function to an abnormal level. In at-risk patients, there is good evidence for the protective value of neurohormonal antagonists and statins: the use of GLS enables these benefits to be directed to those most likely to benefit, while minimizing their use in the majority of people, who do not need them. Although GLS requires an element of training and efforts to ensure uniformity, it has proven to be a feasible, robust, and reproducible technique, ready for wide adoption.© 2022.

The present study aimed to assess whether real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted optical diagnosis is accurate enough to implement the leave-in-situ strategy for diminutive (≤ 5 mm) rectosigmoid polyps (DRSPs).Consecutive colonoscopy outpatients with ≥ 1 DRSP were included. DRSPs were categorized as adenomas or nonadenomas by the endoscopists, who had differing expertise in optical diagnosis, with the assistance of a real-time AI system (CAD-EYE). The primary end point was ≥ 90 % negative predictive value (NPV) for adenomatous histology in high confidence AI-assisted optical diagnosis of DRSPs (Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable endoscopic Innovations [PIVI-1] threshold), with histopathology as the reference standard. The agreement between optical- and histology-based post-polypectomy surveillance intervals (≥ 90 %; PIVI-2 threshold) was also calculated according to European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and United States Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) guidelines.Overall 596 DRSPs were retrieved for histology in 389 patients; an AI-assisted high confidence optical diagnosis was made in 92.3 %. The NPV of AI-assisted optical diagnosis for DRSPs (PIVI-1) was 91.0 % (95 %CI 87.1 %-93.9 %). The PIVI-2 threshold was met with 97.4 % (95 %CI 95.7 %-98.9 %) and 92.6 % (95 %CI 90.0 %-95.2 %) of patients according to ESGE and USMSTF, respectively.

This does not however offset the need for endoscopists' high level confidence and expertise. The AI system seems to be useful, especially for nonexperts.Thieme.

Assessment of the fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mediastinal shift angle (MSA) was shown to have an inverse correlation with the total fetal lung volume (TFLV), being associated with neonatal survival. However, a possible association with postnatal morbidity has never been investigated. We hypothesize that the degree of the mediastinal shift could be associated with higher respiratory and cardiocirculatory impairment, requiring intensive treatments and extended hospitalization in survivors. We retrospectively consider a cohort of isolated, left-sided CDH, for whom we calculated the MSA and the observed/expected (O/E) TFLV at fetal MRI. We performed a data collection regarding inotropic or vasoactive support, treatment with pulmonary vasodilators, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay. General linear models were performed. The MSA and O/E TFLV were inversely correlated (Pearson's coefficient - 0.65, p < 0.001), and deceased patients showed higher MSA values then survivors (p = 0.011). Among survivors, an increase in MSA was associated with longer pharmacological treatments (dobutamine: p = 0.016; dopamine: p = 0.049; hydrocortisone: p = 0.003; nitric oxide: p = 0.002; sildenafil: p = 0.039; milrinone: p = 0.039; oxygen: p = 0.066), and mechanical ventilation (p = 0.005), with an increasing trend in the length of hospitalization (p = 0.089).Conclusion: The MSA indirectly reflects lung hypoplasia and is associated with a higher neonatal intensity of cares. However, further studies are needed to consolidate the results.Trial registration: The study is an exploratory post hoc analysis of the registered NeoAPACHE protocol at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT04396028. What is Known: • In congenital diaphragmatic hernia, the lung size, liver position, and defect side are the most common prenatal prognostic parameters used in clinical practice for morbidity and mortality prediction. • Lung hypoplasia, strictly associated with lung size, is estimated by observed/expected lung to head ratio and observed/expected total fetal lung volume with prenatal ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. What is New: • A new, faster, more straightforward, and less operator-dependent tool to assess CDH severity could be the mediastinal shift angle calculation with fetal magnetic resonance imaging. • Postnatal clinical severity, considered as a postnatal cardiovascular and respiratory impairment that indirectly reflects lung hypoplasia, is associated with an increased mediastinal shift angle calculation.© 2021.

Emergency cervical cerclage (ECC) for cervical dilatation with exposed unruptured membranes is less common and the potential benefits of cerclage are less certain. A randomised control trial is needed to accurately assess the effectiveness of ECC in preventing pregnancy loss compared to an expectant approach.C-STICH2 is a multicentre randomised controlled trial in which women presenting with cervical dilatation and unruptured exposed membranes at 16 + 0 to 27 + 6 weeks gestation are randomised to ECC or expectant management. Trial design includes 18 month internal pilot with embedded qualitative process evaluation, minimal data set and a within-trial health economic analysis. Inclusion criteria are ≥16 years, singleton pregnancy, exposed membranes at the external os, gestation 16 + 0-27 + 6 weeks, and informed consent. Exclusion criteria are contraindication to cerclage, cerclage in situ or previous cerclage in this pregnancy. Randomisation occurs via an online service in a 1:1 ratio, using a minimisation algorithm to reduce chance imbalances in key prognostic variables (site, gestation and dilatation). Primary outcome is pregnancy loss; a composite including miscarriage, termination of pregnancy and perinatal mortality defined as stillbirth and neonatal death in the first week of life. Secondary outcomes include all core outcomes for PTB. Two-year development outcomes will be assessed using general health and Parent Report of Children's Abilities-Revised (PARCA-R) questionnaires. Intended sample size is 260 participants (130 each arm) based on 60% rate of pregnancy loss in the expectant management arm and 40% in the ECC arm, with 90% power and alpha 0.05. Analysis will be by intention-to-treat.To date there has been one small trial of ECC in 23 participants which included twin and singleton pregnancies. This small trial along with the largest observational study (n = 161) found ECC to prolong pregnancy duration and reduce deliveries before 34 weeks gestation. It is important to generate high quality evidence on the effectiveness of ECC in preventing pregnancy loss, and improve understanding of the prevalence of the condition and frequency of complications associated with ECC. An adequately powered RCT will provide the highest quality evidence regarding optimum care for these women and their babies.ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN12981869 . Registered on 13th June 2018.© 2021.

The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality, and the secondary outcome measures were in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality. Statistical analyses included simple descriptive statistics, binary logistic regression analyses, and Kaplan-Meier survival statistics.A total of 523 octogenarians were eligible for inclusion. Emergency laparotomy in octogenarians was associated with 21.8% (95% CI 18.3-25.6%) 30-day postoperative mortality, 22.6% (95% CI 19.0-26.4%) in-hospital mortality, and 40.2% (95% CI 35.9-44.5%) 1-year mortality.

An independent cohort of 954 DLBCL patients from three other hospitals was used for external validation.Age, performance status, stage, lactate dehydrogenase, number of extranodal sites, BCL2, CD5 expression, B symptoms and absolute lymphocyte and monocyte count were the main factors of the NPI model and could stratify the patients into four distinct categories based on their predicted OS. The calibration curve demonstrated satisfactory agreement between the predicted and actual 5-year OS of the patients. The concordance index of the NPI model (0.794) was higher than the IPI (0.759) and NCCN-IPI (0.750), and similar results were obtained upon external validation. For CD5 + DLBCL patients, systemic treatment with high-dose methotrexate was associated with superior OS compared to R-CHOP-based immunochemotherapy alone.We established and validated an accurate prediction model, which performed better than IPI and NCCN-IPI for prognostic stratification of DLBCL patients.© 2021.

This study was designed to provide an up-to-date snapshot of patient and disease characteristics, treatment pathways, and healthcare resource use (HRU) in COPD in real life, and comprehensively examine patients considering GOLD 2019 recommendations.This mixed design, observational, multicenter (14 pulmonology clinics) study included all patients with a documented COPD diagnosis (excluding asthma-COPD overlap [ACO]) for ≥12 months, aged ≥40 years at diagnosis who had a COPD-related hospital visit, spirometry test and blood eosinophil count (BEC) measurement under stable conditions within the 12 months before enrollment between February and December 2020. Data were collected cross-sectionally from patients and retrospectively from hospital medical records.This study included 522 patients (GOLD group A: 17.2%, B: 46.4%, C: 3.3%, D: 33.1%), of whom 79.5% were highly symptomatic and 36.2% had high risk of exacerbation. Exacerbations (n = 832; 46.6% moderate, 25.5% severe) were experienced by 57.5% of patients in the previous 12 months. Inter-rater agreement between investigators and patients regarding the reason for visit was low (κ coefficient: 0.338, p = 0.001). Inhaled treatment was modified in 88 patients at index, mainly due to symptomatic state (31.8%) and exacerbations (27.3%); treatment was escalated (57.9%, mainly switched to LABA+LAMA+ICS), inhaler device and/or active ingredient was changed (36.4%) or treatment was de-escalated (5.7%). 27% had ≥1 hospital overnight stay over 12 months. Emergency department visits and days with limitation of daily activities were higher in group D (p < 0.001).Despite being on-treatment, many patients with COPD experience persistent symptoms and exacerbations requiring hospital-related HRU.

The aims were to derive and assess risk models for predicting lung cancer incidence, CVD mortality and COPD mortality by combining quantitative computed tomography (CT) measures from each disease, and to quantify the added predictive benefit of self-reported patient characteristics given the availability of a CT scan.A survey model (patient characteristics only), CT model (CT information only) and final model (all variables) were derived for each outcome using parsimonious Cox regression on a sample from the National Lung Screening Trial (n=15 000). Validation was performed using Multicentric Italian Lung Detection data (n=2287). Time-dependent measures of model discrimination and calibration are reported.Age, mean lung density, emphysema score, bronchial wall thickness and aorta calcium volume are variables that contributed to all final models. Nodule features were crucial for lung cancer incidence predictions but did not contribute to CVD and COPD mortality prediction. In the derivation cohort, the lung cancer incidence CT model had a 5-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 82.5% (95% CI 80.9-84.0%), significantly inferior to that of the final model (84.0%, 82.6-85.5%). However, the addition of patient characteristics did not improve the lung cancer incidence model performance in the validation cohort (CT model 80.1%, 74.2-86.0%; final model 79.9%, 73.9-85.8%). Similarly, the final CVD mortality model outperformed the other two models in the derivation cohort (survey model 74.9%, 72.7-77.1%; CT model 76.3%, 74.1-78.5%; final model 79.1%, 77.0-81.2%), but not the validation cohort (survey model 74.8%, 62.2-87.5%; CT model 72.1%, 61.1-83.2%; final model 72.2%, 60.4-84.0%). Combining patient characteristics and CT measures provided the largest increase in accuracy for the COPD mortality final model (92.3%, 90.1-94.5%) compared to either other model individually (survey model 87.5%, 84.3-90.6%; CT model 87.9%, 84.8-91.0%), but no external validation was performed due to a very low event frequency.CT measures of CVD and COPD provides small but reproducible improvements to nodule-based lung cancer risk prediction accuracy from 3 years onwards.

We compared SVR rates and all-cause, liver- and non-liver-related deaths, liver-related events, and non-liver-related cancers in HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected participants from 2 French cohort studies after initiation of DAA treatment.Up to 4 HCV-monoinfected participants from the ANRS CO22 HEPATHER cohort were matched by age and sex to each HIV/HCV-coinfected patient from the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort; both are nationwide, prospective, multicentre, and observational. Participants were initiated on DAAs between March 2014 and December 2017. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted by age, sex, duration since HCV diagnosis, HCV transmission routes, HCV genotypes, cirrhosis, tobacco, alcohol consumption, and SVR (time dependent) were used.A total of 592 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 2,049 HCV-monoinfected participants were included; median age was 53.3 years (inter-quartile range: 49.6-56.9) and 52.9 years (49.6; 56.7), 1,498 (73.1%) and 436 (73.6%) were men, and 159 (28.8%) and 793 (41.2%) had cirrhosis, respectively. SVR was observed in 92.9% and 94.6%, respectively. HIV coinfection was associated with higher risk of all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.93; 95% CI 1.01-3.69), non-liver-related death (HR 2.84; 95% CI 1.27-6.36), and non-liver-related cancer (HR 3.26; 95% CI 1.50-7.08), but not with liver-related-death (HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.34-3.15) or liver-related events (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.31-1.44).After DAA treatment, HIV-coinfected individuals had similar SVR rates and risk of liver-related deaths and events compared with HCV-monoinfected individuals, but had a higher risk of all-cause and non-liver-related deaths and non-liver-related cancers.We compared the risk of several clinical events in participants infected by human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus with those infected with hepatitis C virus alone, matched on age and sex, after treatment with contemporary direct-acting antivirals. We found a higher risk of all-cause deaths, non-liver-related deaths, and non-liver-related cancers in participants coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, and no differences for the risk of liver-related deaths or events.Copyright © 2020 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

These disorders include well-controlled chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension (pregnancy-induced hypertension) and mild pre-eclampsia. The definitive treatment for these disorders is planned early delivery and the alternative is to manage the pregnancy expectantly if severe uncontrolled hypertension is not present, with close maternal and fetal monitoring. There are benefits and risks associated with both, so it is important to establish the safest option.To assess the benefits and risks of a policy of planned early delivery versus a policy of expectant management in pregnant women with hypertensive disorders, at or near term (from 34 weeks onwards).We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (12 January 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.Randomised trials of a policy of planned early delivery (by induction of labour or by caesarean section) compared with a policy of delayed delivery (""expectant management"") for women with hypertensive disorders from 34 weeks' gestation. Cluster-randomised trials would have been eligible for inclusion in this review, but we found none.Studies using a quasi-randomised design are not eligible for inclusion in this review. Similarly, studies using a cross-over design are not eligible for inclusion, because they are not a suitable study design for investigating hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and risks of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.We included five studies (involving 1819 women) in this review.There was a lower risk of composite maternal mortality and severe morbidity for women randomised to receive planned early delivery (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83, two studies, 1459 women (evidence graded high)). There were no clear differences between subgroups based on our subgroup analysis by gestational age, gestational week or condition. Planned early delivery was associated with lower risk of HELLP syndrome (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93, 1628 women; three studies) and severe renal impairment (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.92, 100 women, one study).There was not enough information to draw any conclusions about the effects on composite infant mortality and severe morbidity. We observed a high level of heterogeneity between the two studies in this analysis (two studies, 1459 infants, I2 = 87%, Tau2 = 0.98), so we did not pool data in meta-analysis. There were no clear differences between subgroups based on our subgroup analysis by gestational age, gestational week or condition. Planned early delivery was associated with higher levels of respiratory distress syndrome (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.18, three studies, 1511 infants), and NICU admission (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.40, four studies, 1585 infants).There was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07, 1728 women, four studies, evidence graded moderate), or in the duration of hospital stay for the mother after delivery of the baby (mean difference (MD) -0.16 days, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.15, two studies, 925 women, evidence graded moderate) or for the baby (MD -0.20 days, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.17, one study, 756 infants, evidence graded moderate).Two fairly large, well-designed trials with overall low risk of bias contributed the majority of the evidence. Other studies were at low or unclear risk of bias. No studies attempted to blind participants or clinicians to group allocation, potentially introducing bias as women and staff would have been aware of the intervention and this may have affected aspects of care and decision-making.The level of evidence was graded high (composite maternal mortality and morbidity), moderate (caesarean section, duration of hospital stay after delivery for mother, and duration of hospital stay after delivery for baby) or low (composite infant mortality and morbidity). Where the evidence was downgraded, it was mostly because the confidence intervals were wide, crossing both the line of no effect and appreciable benefit or harm.For women suffering from hypertensive disorders of pregnancy after 34 weeks, planned early delivery is associated with less composite maternal morbidity and mortality. There is no clear difference in the composite outcome of infant mortality and severe morbidity; however, this is based on limited data (from two trials) assessing all hypertensive disorders as one group.Further studies are needed to look at the different types of hypertensive diseases and the optimal timing of delivery for these conditions. These studies should also include infant and maternal morbidity and mortality outcomes, caesarean section, duration of hospital stay after delivery for mother and duration of hospital stay after delivery for baby.An individual patient meta-analysis on the data currently available would provide further information on the outcomes of the different types of hypertensive disease encountered in pregnancy.",13/89/05|Department of Health|United Kingdom,21/01/2017,D016428;D017418;D013485;D016454;D000078182,10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2,NA,0,0,,

COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) has been utilized as a potential therapy for patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. This study evaluated the outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with CCP in a prospective, observational, multicenter trial.From April through August 2020, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at 16 participating hospitals in Colorado were enrolled and treated with CCP and compared with hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Plasma antibody levels were determined following the trial, given that antibody tests were not approved at the initiation of the trial. CCP-treated and untreated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were matched using propensity scores followed by analysis for length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality.A total of 542 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at 16 hospitals across the region. A total of 468 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were entered into propensity score matching with 188 patients matched for analysis in the CCP-treatment and control arms. Fine-Gray models revealed increased length of hospital stay in CCP-treated patients and no change in inpatient mortality compared with controls. In subgroup analysis of CCP-treated patients within 7 days of admission, there was no difference in length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality.These data show that treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with CCP did not significantly improve patient hospitalization length of stay or inpatient mortality.© The Author(s) 2021.

Knowledge regarding risk stratification, arrhythmogenesis, therapy, and prognosis is limited. The aim of this study was to analyse the outcome of patients suffering from NCCM and ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) focusing on a treatment with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy and catheter ablation.We conducted a multicentre observational study on 18 patients with NCCM, who underwent ICD implantation for secondary (n = 12) and primary (n = 6) prevention. In patients with multiple symptomatic episodes of VAs catheter ablation was performed. During a follow-up of 62 ± 42 months, 12 patients (67%) presented with appropriate ICD therapies [ventricular tachycardia (VT): n = 8; ventricular fibrillation (VF): n = 4; VT/VF: n = 3]. Ten patients underwent catheter ablation for VT/VF. Solely endocardial ablation was conducted in eight patients, and in two patients endo- and epicardial ablation was performed within the same procedure. Acute procedural success was achieved in 9/10 patients. Ventricular tachycardia recurrence was observed in two patients and the median arrhythmia free interval was 9.5 months (interquartile range 5.3-21 months). One patient underwent reablation, four patients died due to the underlying NCCM, and one patient received a left ventricular assist device.Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients suffering from NCCM and ICD therapy may be effective for primary and secondary prevention. In our cohort, consisting of patients with multiple VA episodes and recurrent ICD therapy, catheter ablation offered a safe and effective therapeutically option.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

We investigated the relationship between mCCI score and time to all-cause death using Cox proportional hazards models. Models were fit for quartiles of the comorbidity index, reference coding was used, with quartile 1 (Q1; mCCI score of 1-2) selected as the reference. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported from these models. Following the same analysis framework as the original manuscript, patients assigned to amiodarone or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) were compared with those assigned to placebo in separate Cox models. Each model included the mCCI score in quartiles, group assignment, and an interaction term for the quartile and group assignment. HRs and corresponding 97.5% CIs were reported from these models.The majority of patients had an mCCI score ≤5 (75.4%), and mortality risk was associated with increasing score. The HRs for Q2 (score 3), Q3 (scores 4-5), and Q4 (scores ≥6) were 1.46 (97.5% CI 1.06-1.99), 3.03 (97.5% CI 2.35-3.90), and 4.51 (97.5% CI 3.46-5.88), respectively. For the subgroup analysis, amiodarone was not associated with a significant difference compared with placebo for individuals in Q1-Q3; however, it was associated with an increase in death for those in Q4 (HR 1.50; 97.5% CI 1.03-2.18). ICD was associated with a significant reduction in death compared with placebo for individuals in Q1 and Q3 (HR 0.42; 97.5% CI 0.20-0.84 and HR 0.70; 97.5% CI 0.50-0.97, respectively) but not for those in Q2 or Q4. Interaction testing across subgroups suggested HTE for amiodarone (p = 0.07) and ICD (p = 0.08) versus placebo across mCCI quartiles.Increasing comorbidity burden was associated with HTE when evaluating amiodarone and ICD compared with placebo in the SCD-HeFT trial. Our results highlight the importance of enrolling diverse patient populations in clinical trials and considering the possibility of HTE when translating results to clinical practice.© 2022.

The prevalence of AF is increasing with a growing and aging population, and timely access to care for these patients is a concern. Nontraditional models of care delivery, such as nurse practitioner (NP)-led clinics, may improve access to care and quality of care, but they require formal assessment. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of NP-led care on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adult patients with AF.We plan a randomized controlled trial comparing NP-led care vs. standard care. Inclusion criteria are ≥18 years of age, documented nonvalvular AF, willingness to give informed consent, and capacity to complete questionnaires. Patients referred for electrophysiological intervention who are clinically unstable or unable to attend follow-up visits will not be eligible to participate. Patients will be asked for verbal consent during the initial triage phone call from the nurse. Randomization will occur via a secure website. The intervention includes an NP consult, including medical history, physical examination, patient teaching, treatment plan, and follow-up at 3 and 6 months. The control arm involves usual cardiologist consultation with follow-up determined by the cardiologist's practice pattern. The primary outcome will be the difference in change in Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life Survey scores at 6 months between groups. Secondary outcomes will include difference in change of EQ-5D scores at 6 months between groups, difference in composite outcomes of death resulting from cardiovascular cause, hospitalizations and emergency department visits between groups, and satisfaction with NP-led care measured by the Consultant Satisfaction Questionnaire. A sample size of 70 per group will ensure adequate power despite a potential 10% loss to follow-up.Our study will determine the effect of NP-led AF care on HRQoL in patients with AF, as well as measure its impact on relevant outcomes such as death, hospitalization, and emergency department visits.

Our study demonstrates that in a postoperative setting, improving upon nationally accepted constraints is achievable and leads to reductions in normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) without compromising disease control.We identified 92 patients at our institution between 2015 and 2019 with p16+ oropharyngeal cancer who were treated with adjuvant volumetric modulated arc therapy. We included patients treated to postoperative doses and standard volumes (including bilateral neck). Doses delivered to organs at risk were compared with recommended dose constraints from a recent cooperative group head and neck cancer trial of radiation therapy to 60 Gy. We applied validated and published NTCP models for dysphagia, dysgeusia, esophagitis, oral mucositis, and xerostomia relevant to oropharyngeal cancer.Achievable and delivered mean doses to most normal head and neck tissues were well below national recommended constraints. This translates to notable absolute NTCP reductions for salivary flow (10% improvement in contralateral parotid, 35% improvement in submandibular gland), grade ≥ 2 esophagitis (23% improvement), grade ≥ 3 mucositis (17% improvement), dysgeusia (10% improvement), and dysphagia (8% improvement). Locoregional control at a median follow-up of 26.3 months was 96.7%, with only 3 patients experiencing locoregional recurrence (1 local, 2 regional).Modern radiation therapy planning techniques allow for improved normal tissue sparing compared with currently established dose constraints without compromising disease control. These improvements may lead to reduced toxicity in a patient population expected to have favorable long-term outcomes. Stricter constraints can be easily achieved and should be used in conjunction with other evolving efforts to mitigate toxicity.Copyright © 2022 American Society for Radiation Oncology.

Long-term implantable cardiac monitors may be better at diagnosing atrial fibrillation and provide an opportunity to reduce the risk of stroke recurrence with anticoagulants.The objectives were to assess the diagnostic test accuracy, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three implantable monitors [BioMonitor 2-AF™ (Biotronik SE & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany), Confirm Rx™ (Abbott Laboratories, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) and Reveal LINQ™ (Medtronic plc, Minneapolis, MN, USA)] in patients who have had a cryptogenic stroke and for whom no atrial fibrillation is detected after 24 hours of external electrocardiographic monitoring.MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and Health Technology Assessment databases were searched from inception until September 2018.A systematic review was undertaken. Two reviewers agreed on studies for inclusion and performed quality assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Results were discussed narratively because there were insufficient data for synthesis. A two-stage de novo economic model was developed: (1) a short-term patient flow model to identify cryptogenic stroke patients who have had atrial fibrillation detected and been prescribed anticoagulation treatment (rather than remaining on antiplatelet treatment) and (2) a long-term Markov model that captured the lifetime costs and benefits of patients on either anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment.One randomised controlled trial, Cryptogenic Stroke and underlying Atrial Fibrillation (CRYSTAL-AF) (Sanna T, Diener HC, Passman RS, Di Lazzaro V, Bernstein RA, Morillo CA, et al. Cryptogenic stroke and underlying atrial fibrillation. N Engl J Med 2014;370:2478-86), was identified, and no diagnostic test accuracy study was identified. The CRYSTAL-AF trial compared the Reveal™ XT (a Reveal LINQ predecessor) (Medtronic plc) monitor with standard of care monitoring. Twenty-six single-arm observational studies for the Reveal devices were also identified. The only data for BioMonitor 2-AF or Confirm Rx were from mixed population studies supplied by the companies. Atrial fibrillation detection in the CRYSTAL-AF trial was higher with the Reveal XT than with standard monitoring at all time points. By 36 months, atrial fibrillation was detected in 19% of patients with an implantable cardiac monitor and in 2.3% of patients receiving conventional follow-up. The 26 observational studies demonstrated that, even in a cryptogenic stroke population, atrial fibrillation detection rates are highly variable and most cases are asymptomatic; therefore, they probably would not have been picked up without an implantable cardiac monitor. Device-related adverse events, such as pain and infection, were low in all studies. The de novo economic model produced incremental cost effectiveness ratios comparing implantable cardiac monitors with standard of care monitoring to detect atrial fibrillation in cryptogenic stroke patients based on data for the Reveal XT device, which can be related to Reveal LINQ. The BioMonitor 2-AF and Confirm RX were included in the analysis by making a strong assumption of equivalence with Reveal LINQ. The results indicate that implantable cardiac monitors could be considered cost-effective at a £20,000-30,000 threshold. When each device is compared incrementally, BioMonitor 2-AF dominates Reveal LINQ and Confirm RX.The cost-effectiveness analysis for implantable cardiac monitors is based on a strong assumption of clinical equivalence and should be interpreted with caution.All three implantable cardiac monitors could be considered cost-effective at a £20,000-30,000 threshold, compared with standard of care monitoring, for cryptogenic stroke patients with no atrial fibrillation detected after 24 hours of external electrocardiographic monitoring; however, further clinical studies are required to confirm their efficacy in cryptogenic stroke patients.This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42018109216.This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 24, No. 5.

We evaluated an innovative ICT platform for integrated care which orchestrates data from various health care providers to optimize care management processes.The Horizon2020-funded research project PICASO (picaso-project.eu) established an ICT platform that offers integration of care services across providers and supports patients' management along the continuum of care, leaving the data with the owner. Strict conformity with ethical and legal legislations was augmented with a usability-driven engineering process, user requirements gathering from relevant stakeholders, and expert walkthroughs guided developments. Developments based on the HL7/FHIR standard granting interoperability. Platform's applicability in clinical routine was an essential aim. Thus, we evaluated the platform according to an evaluation framework in an observational 6-month proof-of-concept study with RA patients affected by cardiovascular comorbidities using questionnaires, interviews, and platform data.Thirty RA patients (80% female) participated, mean age 59 years, disease duration 13 years, average number of comorbidities 2.9. Home monitoring data demonstrated high platform adherence. Evaluations yielded predominantly positive feedback: The innovative dashboard-like design offering time-efficient data visualization, comprehension, and personalization was well accepted, i.e., patients rated the platform ""overall"" as 2.3 (1.1) (mean (SD), Likert scales 1-6) and clinicians recommended further platform use for 93% of their patients. They managed 86% of patients' visits using the clinician dashboard. Dashboards were valued for a broader view of health status and patient-physician interactions. Platform use contributed to improved disease and comorbidity management (i.e., in 70% physicians reported usefulness to assess patients' diseases and in 33% potential influence on treatment decisions; risk manager was used in 59%) and empowered patients (i.e., 48% set themselves new health-related goals, 92% stated easier patient-physician communications).Comprehensive aggregation of clinical data from distributed sources in a modern, GDPR-compliant cloud platform can improve physicians' and patients' knowledge of the disease status and comorbidities as well as patients' management. It empowers patients to monitor and positively contribute to their disease management. Effects on patients' outcome, behavior, and changes in the health care systems should be explored by implementing ICT-based platforms enriched by upcoming Artificial Intelligence features where possible.DRKS-German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00013637 , prospectively registered. 17 January 2018.",NA,29/05/2021,D016428;D064888;D013485,10.1186/s13075-021-02526-7,NA,1,1,,

Unbiased Recursive Partitioning regression with Conditional Inference Trees (URP-CTREE) is a novel approach developed through analyses of a large European SCI database (European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord Injury). URP-CTREE uses early neurologic impairment to predict achieved motor recovery, with potential to optimize clinical trial design by optimizing patient stratification and decreasing sample sizes. We performed external validation to determine how well a previously reported URP-CTREE model stratified patients into distinct homogeneous subgroups and predicted subsequent neurologic recovery in an independent cohort. We included patients with acute cervical SCI level C4-C6 from a prospective registry at a quaternary care center from 2004-2018 (n = 101) and applied the URP-CTREE model and evaluated Upper Extremity Motor Score (UEMS) recovery, considered correctly predicted when final UEMS scores were within a pre-specified threshold of 9 points from median; sensitivity analyses evaluated the effect of timing of baseline neurological examination. We included 101 patients, whose mean times from injury baseline and follow-up examinations were 6.1 days (standard deviation [SD] 17) and 235.0 days (SD 71), respectively. Median UEMS recovery was 7 points (interquartile range 2-12). One of the predictor variables was not statistically significant in our sample; one group did not fit progressively improving UEMS scores, and three of five groups had medians that were not significantly different from adjacent groups. Overall accuracy was 75%, but varied from 82% among participants whose examinations occurred at <12 h, to 64% at 12-24 h, and 58% at >24 h. A previous URP-CTREE model had limited ability to stratify an independent into homogeneous subgroups. Overall accuracy was promising, but may be sensitive to timing of baseline neurological examinations. Further evaluation of external validity in incomplete injuries, influence of timing of baseline examinations, and investigation of additional stratification strategies is warranted.",NA,14/03/2019,D016428;D016448;D064888;D023361,10.1089/neu.2018.6335,NA,0,0,,

Still, evidence regarding collateral consequences of the potential increase of induction of labor procedures is still lacking. Also, the results of these studies must be carefully interpreted and thoroughly counter-balanced with women's thoughts and opinions regarding the active management of the last weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, it may be useful to develop a tool that aids in the decision-making process by differentiating women who will spontaneously go into labor from those who will require induction.To develop a predictive model to calculate the probability of spontaneous onset of labor at term.We designed a prospective national multicentric observational study including women enrolled at 39 weeks of gestation, carrying singleton pregnancies. After signing an informed consent form, several clinical, ultrasonographic, biophysical and biochemical variables will be collected by trained staff. If delivery has not occurred at 40 weeks of pregnancy, a second visit and evaluation will be performed. Prenatal care will be continued according to current hospital guidelines. Once recruitment is completed, the information gathered will be used to develop a logistic regression-based predictive model of spontaneous onset of labor between 39 and 41 weeks of gestation. A secondary exploration of the data collected at 40 weeks, as well as a survival analysis regarding time-to-delivery outcomes will also be performed.

Disease severity was assessed using a 7-point ordinal scale based on degree of respiratory illness. Patients were prospectively surveyed for 1 year after discharge for post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) through quarterly surveys. Demographics, comorbidities, radiographic findings, clinical laboratory values, SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology were captured over a 28-day period. Multivariable logistic regression was performed.The median age was 59 years (interquartile range [IQR] 20); 711 (61%) were men; overall mortality was 14%, and 228 (20%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Unsupervised clustering of ordinal score over time revealed distinct disease course trajectories. Risk factors associated with prolonged hospitalization or death by day 28 included age ≥ 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.01; 95% CI 1.28-3.17), Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 1.71; 95% CI 1.13-2.57), elevated baseline creatinine (OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.63- 4.80) or troponin (OR 1.89; 95% 1.03-3.47), baseline lymphopenia (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.61-2.97), presence of infiltrate by chest imaging (OR 3.16; 95% CI 1.96-5.10), and high SARS-CoV2 viral load (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.17-2.00). Fatal cases had the lowest ratio of SARS-CoV-2 antibody to viral load levels compared to other trajectories over time (p=0.001). 589 survivors (51%) completed at least one survey at follow-up with 305 (52%) having at least one symptom consistent with PASC, most commonly dyspnea (56% among symptomatic patients). Female sex was the only associated risk factor for PASC.Integration of PCR cycle threshold, and antibody values with demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory/radiographic findings identified risk factors for 28-day outcome severity, though only female sex was associated with PASC.

The aim was to provide a well-characterized sample cohort for specimen sharing, data mining, and long-term research aims. Canine mammary tumors are most frequently managed at a local veterinary clinic or hospital. We adopted a biobank framework based on a large number of participating veterinary hospitals and clinics acting as collection centers that were serviced by a centralized storage facility. Recruitment was targeted at rural veterinary clinics. A tailored, stable collection kit (DogMATIC) was designed that was used by veterinarians in remote or rural locations to collect both fresh and fixed tissue for submission to the biobank. To validate this methodology the kit design, collection rate, and sample quality were analyzed. The Australian Veterinary Cancer Biobank was established as a network of 47 veterinary clinics and three veterinary pathology laboratories spanning over 200,000 km(2).

Our study aimed to train a clinically applicable DLS for fundus diseases using data derived from the real world, and externally test the model using fundus photographs collected prospectively from the settings in which the model would most likely be adopted.In this national real-world evidence study, we trained a DLS, the Comprehensive AI Retinal Expert (CARE) system, to identify the 14 most common retinal abnormalities using 207 228 colour fundus photographs derived from 16 clinical settings with different disease distributions. CARE was internally validated using 21 867 photographs and externally tested using 18 136 photographs prospectively collected from 35 real-world settings across China where CARE might be adopted, including eight tertiary hospitals, six community hospitals, and 21 physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was further compared with that of 16 ophthalmologists and tested using datasets with non-Chinese ethnicities and previously unused camera types. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04213430, and is currently closed.The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the internal validation set was 0·955 (SD 0·046). AUC values in the external test set were 0·965 (0·035) in tertiary hospitals, 0·983 (0·031) in community hospitals, and 0·953 (0·042) in physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was similar to that of ophthalmologists. Large variations in sensitivity were observed among the ophthalmologists in different regions and with varying experience. The system retained strong identification performance when tested using the non-Chinese dataset (AUC 0·960, 95% CI 0·957-0·964 in referable diabetic retinopathy).Our DLS (CARE) showed satisfactory performance for screening multiple retinal abnormalities in real-world settings using prospectively collected fundus photographs, and so could allow the system to be implemented and adopted for clinical care.This study was funded by the National Key R&D Programme of China, the Science and Technology Planning Projects of Guangdong Province, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.For the Chinese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Potential contributors to ESUS include patent foramen ovale (PFO) and non-stenotic plaque (<50%, NSP) of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). To better differentiate these as unique mechanisms, we explored the prevalence of each in a multicenter observational cohort.A retrospective multicenter cohort of consecutive patients with ESUS was queried (2015-2021). Patients with unilateral, anterior circulation ESUS who had a computed tomography angiography neck scan and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and/or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) with adequate visualization of a PFO were included. Patients with prior carotid stent, endarterectomy or alternative etiologies were excluded from the study. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patients with and without PFO, with multivariable logistic regression used to predict the presence of a PFO based on clinicoradiographic factors as well as degree of luminal stenosis and ipsilateral plaque thickness >3mm, based on previously published thresholds of clinical relevance.Of the 234 included patients with unilateral anterior ESUS and adequate TTE or TEE, 17 (7.3%) had a PFO and 64 (27.4%) had ≥3mm of ipsilateral ICA plaque. Patients with PFO had significantly less NSP and less ipsilateral cervical ICA stenosis (0% [IQR 0-0%] vs. 0% [IQR 0-50%], p=0.03; Table). After adjustment for all predictors of PFO in multivariable regression (p<0.1: Hispanic ethnicity and ipsilateral plaque thickness), ipsilateral NSP was independently associated with a 62% lower odds of harboring a PFO (ORadj per 1cm of plaque 0.48, 95%CI 0.25-0.94). No patients with a PFO had ≥3mm of ipsilateral ICA plaque.Ipsilateral NSP is more common in ESUS patients without a PFO. While this study is limited by the small PFO event rate, it supports the notion that NSP and PFO may be independent contributors to ESUS.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

International guidelines recommend a routine invasive strategy for managing patients with NSTE-ACS at high to very high-risk, supported by evidence of improved composite ischaemic outcomes as compared with a selective invasive strategy. However, accurate diagnosis of NSTE-ACS in the acute setting is challenging due to the spectrum of non-coronary disease that can manifest with similar symptoms. Heterogeneous clinical presentations and limited uptake of risk prediction tools can confound physician decision-making regarding the use and timing of invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Large proportions of patients with suspected NSTE-ACS do not require revascularisation but may unnecessarily undergo ICA with its attendant risks and associated costs. Advances in coronary CT angiography and cardiac MRI have prompted evaluation of whether non-invasive strategies may improve patient selection, or whether tailored approaches are better suited to specific subgroups. Future directions include (1) better understanding of risk stratification as a guide to investigation and therapy in suspected NSTE-ACS, (2) randomised clinical trials of non-invasive imaging versus standard of care approaches prior to ICA and (3) defining the optimal timing of very early ICA in high-risk NSTE-ACS.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

All patients underwent LSM and SSM by STE. Success and reliability rates were calculated and compared. Intra-observer agreement was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Differences between areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of LSMs and SSMs at different ALT levels were compared using the Delong test.Among 603 CHB patients, the success and reliability rates of SSM were 94.53% (570/603) and 85.74% (517/603), respectively, which were similar to those of LSM (p > 0.05), respectively. The ICC for intra-observer agreements of SSM was 0.964 (p < 0.001). In the total cohort, ALT ≤ 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) group, and A0-1 group, the AUCs of SSMs were significantly lower than those of LSMs for the diagnosis of cirrhosis (p < 0.001). In the ALT > 2 × ULN group and A2-3 group, the AUC of SSM improved and was not significantly different from that of LSM (p = 0.342, p = 0.510, respectively).SSM by STE achieved applicability and repeatability equivalent to those of LSM. SSM might be a good substitute to LSM in patients with high ALT levels.• Spleen stiffness measurement performed by sound touch elastography was proven to have similar applicability and repeatability to liver stiffness measurement in this prospective multicenter study. • Spleen stiffness measurement demonstrated a poorer diagnostic performance for cirrhosis compared with liver stiffness measurement in the total cohort and low ALT level group, yet it showed a similar diagnostic performance to liver stiffness measurement in patients with high ALT levels.© 2022.

Additional prognostic information may be obtained by morphologic characterization of CTCs. We explored whether apoptotic CTCs, CTC clusters and leukocytes attached to CTCs are associated with breast cancer subtype and prognosis at base-line (BL) and in follow-up (FU) blood samples in patients with metastatic breast cancer scheduled for first-line systemic treatment.Patients with a first metastatic breast cancer event were enrolled in a prospective observational study prior to therapy initiation and the CellSearch system (Janssen Diagnostics) was used for CTC enumeration and characterization. We enrolled patients (N = 52) with ≥5 CTC/7.5 ml blood at BL (median 45, range 5-668) and followed them with blood sampling for 6 months during therapy. CTCs were evaluated for apoptotic changes, CTC clusters (≥3 nuclei), and leukocytes associated with CTC (WBC-CTC, ≥1 CTC + ≥1 leukocytes) at all time-points by visual examination of the galleries generated by the CellTracks Analyzer.At BL, patients with triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer had blood CTC clusters present more frequently than patients with hormone receptor-positive cancer (P = 0.010). No morphologic characteristics were associated with prognosis at BL, whereas patients with apoptotic CTCs or clusters in FU samples had worse prognosis compared to patients without these characteristics with respect to progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (log-rank test: P = 0.0012 or lower). Patients with apoptotic or clustered CTCs at any time-point had impaired prognosis in multivariable analyses adjusting for number of CTCs and other prognostic factors (apoptosis: HROS = 25, P < 0.001; cluster: HROS = 7.0, P = 0.006). The presence of WBC-CTCs was significantly associated with an inferior prognosis in terms of OS at 6 months in multivariable analysis.Patients with a continuous presence of apoptotic or clustered CTCs in FU samples after systemic therapy initiation had worse prognosis than patients without these CTC characteristics. In patients with ≥5 CTC/7.5 ml blood at BL, morphologic characterization of persistent CTCs could be an important prognostic marker during treatment, in addition to CTC enumeration alone.

Although a relationship between ACE and AUD has been well-established, potential mechanisms that may underlie this relationship remain to be elucidated. The importance of these mechanisms with respect to relapse risk is of particular interest, given the clinical relevance of relapse in addictions. Thus, the aim of this study is to longitudinally assess the role of clinically relevant variables in the relationship between ACE and AUD, namely stress sensitivity, emotion processing, cue reactivity and cognitive functioning (response inhibition and working memory), in relation to relapse risk.In this observational, longitudinal case-control study, 36 patients with AUD and heavy drinkers with varying degrees of ACE from a previous project (NCT03758053) as well as newly recruited participants from the same study population will be assessed. Besides measuring long-term relapse in AUD by re-examining these 36 previous participants after 2-2.5 years, factors contributing to short-term relapse will be examined by reassessing all participants on a 3-month follow-up. Furthermore, participants with no or mild ACE will be compared with participants with moderate to severe ACE to assess between-subject differences in risk factors for AUD. Questionnaires and interviews will thus be used to cover individuals' drinking behaviour and ACE. Emotion processing, stress sensitivity, cue reactivity and cognitive functioning will be assessed using task-based functional MRI (fMRI). Additionally, saliva cortisol and blood samples will be taken to measure hormonal stress response and to perform genome wide association analyses, respectively. The general linear model will be applied on the first level fMRI analyses, whereas for the second level analyses and analyses of behavioural data, t-tests, regression analyses, repeated-measures and one-way analysis of variances will be used.This study has been approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty Mannheim of Heidelberg University (ethics approval number: 2018-560N-MA with amendment from 29 June 2021).

Seventy-nine patients with confirmed solid extrahepatic malignancies who underwent upper abdominal PET/MR between February 2017 and June 2018 were included. Where focal hepatic lesions were identified, the likelihood of a diagnosis of a liver metastasis was defined on an ordinal scale for MRI, PET, and PET/MRI by 3 readers: 1 nuclear medicine physician and 2 radiologists. The number of lesions per patient, lesion size, and involved hepatic segments were recorded. Proof of metastases was based on histopathologic correlation or clinical/imaging follow-up. Diagnostic performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis.A total of 79 patients (53 years, interquartile range, 50-68; 43 men) were included. PET/MR had a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 97%, positive predictive value of 97%, and negative predictive value of 95%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MRI were 88%, 98%, 98%, and 90% and for PET were 83%, 97%, 97%, and 86%, respectively. The areas under the curve for PET/MRI, MRI, and PET were 95%, 92%, and 92%, respectively.Contrast-enhanced PET/MR has a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value than either PET or MRI alone in the setting of suspected liver metastases. Fewer lesions were characterized as indeterminate by PET/MR in comparison with PET and MRI. This superior performance could potentially impact treatment and management decisions for patients with suspected liver metastases.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In our institution, a prospective observational trial testing CTC detection in mCPRC undergoing I line ARTA therapy terminated the planned enrollment in 2020. Here, we present a pre-planned interim analysis with 18 months of median follow-up. RT-qPCR was used to determine the CTC expression of PSA, PSMA, AR and ARV7 before starting ARTA. PSA-drop, Progression-Free and Overall Survival (PFS and OS) and their correlation with CTC detection were reported. Forty-four patients were included. CTC were detected in 43.2% of patients, of whom 8.94% expressed PSA, 15.78% showed ARV7, 63.15% and 73.68% displayed ARFL and PSMA, respectively. Biochemical response was significantly improved in CTC + vs CTC- patients, with median PSA-drop of 18.5 vs 2.5 ng/ml (p = 0.03). After a median follow-up of 18 months, 50% of patients progressed. PFS was significantly longer in CTC- patients (NR vs 16 months). Eight (18.2%) patients died, a non-significant trend in terms of OS was detected in favor of CTC- patients (NR vs 29 months, p = 0.05).

Innovative and culturally relevant approaches are needed to promote systematic and proactive organization of diabetes care for people living with diabetes on-reserve in Canada. The RADAR model is one strategy to improve care: an integrated disease registry paired with an electronic health record for local community healthcare providers with remote care coordination. We qualitatively assessed adoption and implementation of RADAR in First Nations communities in Alberta to inform its potential spread in the province.We used the RE-AIM framework to evaluate adoption and implementation of RADAR in 6 First Nations communities. Using purposeful sampling, we recruited local healthcare providers and remote care coordinators involved in delivering RADAR to participate in telephone or in-person interviews at 6- and 24-months post-implementation. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and verified for accuracy. Data was analyzed using content analysis and managed using ATLAS.ti 8.In total, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews (6 at 6-months; 15 at 24-months) with 11 participants. Participants included 3 care coordinators and 8 local healthcare providers, including registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and registered dietitians. We found that adoption of RADAR was influenced by leadership as well as appropriateness, acceptability, and perceived value of the model. In addition, we found that implementation of RADAR was variable across communities regardless of implementation supports and appropriate community-specific adaptations.The variable adoption and implementation of RADAR has implications for how likely it will achieve its anticipated outcomes. RADAR is well positioned for spread through continued appropriate community-based adaptations and by expanding the existing implementation supports, including dedicated human resources to support the delivery of RADAR and the provision of levels of RADAR based on existing or developed capacity among local HCPs.Not applicable to this qualitative assessment.  ISRCTN14359671 .",NA,5/05/2021,D016428,10.1186/s12913-021-06424-1,NA,1,1,,

We aimed to identify the prevalence, etiologies, and mortality rates associated with TME in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients.We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study among patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at four New York City hospitals in the same health network between March 1, 2020, and May 20, 2020. TME was diagnosed in patients with altered mental status off sedation or after an adequate sedation washout. Patients with structural brain disease, seizures, or primary neurological diagnoses were excluded. The coprimary outcomes were the prevalence of TME stratified by etiology and in-hospital mortality (excluding comfort care only patients) assessed by using a multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age, race, sex, intubation, intensive care unit requirement, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, hospital location, and date of admission.Among 4491 patients with COVID-19, 559 (12%) were diagnosed with TME, of whom 435 of 559 (78%) developed encephalopathy immediately prior to hospital admission. The most common etiologies were septic encephalopathy (n = 247 of 559 [62%]), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (n = 331 of 559 [59%]), and uremia (n = 156 of 559 [28%]). Multiple etiologies were present in 435 (78%) patients. Compared with those without TME (n = 3932), patients with TME were older (76 vs. 62 years), had dementia (27% vs. 3%) or psychiatric history (20% vs. 10%), were more often intubated (37% vs. 20%), had a longer hospital length of stay (7.9 vs. 6.0 days), and were less often discharged home (25% vs. 66% [all P < 0.001]). Excluding comfort care patients (n = 267 of 4491 [6%]) and after adjustment for confounders, TME remained associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (n = 128 of 425 [30%] patients with TME died, compared with n = 600 of 3799 [16%] patients without TME; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.52, P = 0.031), and TME due to hypoxemia conferred the highest risk (n = 97 of 233 [42%] patients with HIE died, compared with n = 631 of 3991 [16%] patients without HIE; aHR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.00, P = 0.001).TME occurred in one in eight hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was typically multifactorial, and was most often due to hypoxemia, sepsis, and uremia. After we adjustment for confounding factors, TME was associated with a 24% increased risk of in-hospital mortality.© 2021.

Early detection classically involves dermoscopy to identify suspicious lesions for which biopsy is indicated. Biopsy and histological examination then diagnose benign nevi, atypical nevi, or cancerous growths. With current methods, a considerable number of unnecessary biopsies are performed as only 11% of all biopsied, suspicious lesions are actually melanomas. Thus, there is a need for more advanced noninvasive diagnostics to guide the decision of whether or not to biopsy. Artificial intelligence can generate screening algorithms that transform a set of imaging biomarkers into a risk score that can be used to classify a lesion as a melanoma or a nevus by comparing the score to a classification threshold. Melanoma imaging biomarkers have been shown to be spectrally dependent in Red, Green, Blue (RGB) color channels, and hyperspectral imaging may further enhance diagnostic power. The purpose of this study was to use the same melanoma imaging biomarkers previously described, but over a wider range of wavelengths to determine if, in combination with machine learning algorithms, this could result in enhanced melanoma detection.We used the melanoma advanced imaging dermatoscope (mAID) to image pigmented lesions assessed by dermatologists as requiring a biopsy. The mAID is a 21-wavelength imaging device in the 350-950 nm range. We then generated imaging biomarkers from these hyperspectral dermoscopy images, and, with the help of artificial intelligence algorithms, generated a melanoma Q-score for each lesion (0 = nevus, 1 = melanoma). The Q-score was then compared to the histopathologic diagnosis.The overall sensitivity and specificity of hyperspectral dermoscopy in detecting melanoma when evaluated in a set of lesions selected by dermatologists as requiring biopsy was 100% and 36%, respectively.With widespread application, and if validated in larger clinical trials, this non-invasive methodology could decrease unnecessary biopsies and potentially increase life-saving early detection events.

In adults, the classification of septic patients by clinical AKI phenotypes (severity and timing) demonstrates unique associations with patient outcome vs. broadly defined AKI.In a multinational prospective observational study, AKI diagnosis in critically ill septic children was stratified by duration (transient vs. persistent) and severity (mild vs. severe by creatinine change and urine output). The outcomes of interest were mortality and intensive care unit resource complexity at 28 days.Seven hundred and fifty-seven septic children were studied (male 52.7%, age 4.6 years (1.5-11.9)). Mortality (overall 12.1%) was different between severe AKI and mild AKI (18.3 vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001) as well as intensive care unit (ICU) complexity (overall 34.5%, 45 vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001). Patients with Persistent AKI had fewer ICU-free days (17 (7, 21) vs. 24 (17, 26), p < 0.001) and higher ICU complexity (52.8 vs. 22.9%, p = 0.002) than transient AKI, even after exclusion of patients with early mortality. AKI phenotypes incorporating temporal and severity data correlate with unique survival (range 4.4-21.6%) and ICU-free days (range of 15-25 days) CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of septic children with AKI changes by clinical phenotype. Our findings underscore the importance of prognostic enrichment in sepsis and AKI for the purpose of trial design and patient management.Although AKI occurs commonly in patients with sepsis (S-AKI), outcomes for children with S-AKI varies based on the severity and timing of the AKI. Existing S-AKI pediatric data utilize a broad singular definition of kidney injury. Increasing the precision of AKI classification results in a new understanding of how S-AKI associates with patient outcome. A refined classification of S-AKI identifies subgroups of children, making possible a targeted and a personalized medicine approach to S-AKI study and management.© 2021.

There is an urgent need for better identification of such individuals in order to enable earlier treatment and to properly stage and stratify participants for clinical trials and intervention studies. Although some biological measures (biomarkers) can identify Alzheimer's-related changes before significant changes in cognitive function occur, such biomarkers are not ideal as they are only able to place individuals in rudimentary stages of the disease/cognitive decline (Tarnanas et al., Alzheimers Dement (Amst) 1(4):521-532, 2015) and sometimes mistakenly diagnose individuals (Edmonds et al. 2015). Two tests, based on real-world functioning, which have been used to screen for pre-symptomatic AD are (i) dual-task walking tests (Belghali et al. 2017) and (ii) day-out tasks (Tarnanas et al. 2013). A novel digital biomarker, the Altoida ADPS app, which implements gamified versions of these tests has been shown to accurately discriminate between healthy controls and individuals in prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (Tarnanas et al. 2013) and can differentiate between people with mild cognitive impairment who convert to Alzheimer's disease and those who don't (Tarnanas et al. 2015b).

Materials and Methods: This retrospective chart review of patients with TBU was conducted at 11 centers from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017. We used a multiple regression model to analyze which factors influenced best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvement. Results: A total of 79 eyes from 51 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 48.9 ± 16.4 years. The mean change of LogMAR BCVA at last visit was -0.21 ± 0.45. Diagnostic tools used include chest X-ray, chest computed tomography, Mantoux test, interferon gamma release test (QuantiFERON-TB Gold test), intraocular fluid tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction, and bronchial alveolar lavage. The clinical manifestations included 48% posterior uveitis and 37% panuveitis. In the sample, 55% of the cases were bilateral and 45% unilateral. There was 60.76% retinal vasculitis, 35.44% choroiditis, 21.52% serpiginous-like choroiditis, 17.72% vitreous hemorrhage, 12.66% posterior synechiae, 6.33% retinal detachment, and 3.80% choroidal granuloma. Treatment modalities included rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, oral steroid, posterior triamcinolone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitrectomy, and immunosuppressants. BCVA improved in 53.2% of eyes and remained stable in 32.9% of eyes. In the final model of multiple regression, worse initial BCVA, pyrazinamide, and receiving vitrectomy predicted better BCVA improvement. Ethambutol was associated with worse visual outcomes. Seven eyes experienced recurrence. Conclusions: This is the largest 10-year multicenter retrospective study of TBU in Taiwan to date, demonstrating the distribution of clinical manifestations and clinical associations with better treatment outcomes. The study provides a comprehensive description of TBU phenotypes in Taiwan and highlights considerations for the design of further prospective studies to reliably assess the role of ATT and vitrectomy in patients with TBU.",NA,27/03/2022,D016428;D016448,10.3390/medicina58030376,NA,1,1,,

First, the PMRS cutoff associated with a prevalence of obstructive CAD ≤5% was determined in the >5% to 15% PTP PROMISE core lab computed tomographic angiography patients (discovery cohort: n = 2,191). This cutoff was validated for obstructive CAD in >5% to 15% PTP Dan-NICAD patients (CAD validation cohort: n = 1,386) and for prognostic impact on death and myocardial infarction in >5% to 15% PTP PROMISE non-core lab computed tomographic angiography patients (prognosis validation cohort: n = 2,753).In the discovery cohort, a CAD prevalence of ≤5% was found at a PMRS of ≥34%. In the CAD validation cohort, this cutoff down-classified 442 (31.9%) of >5% to 15% PTP patients into the low PTP group (CAD ≤5%); the prevalence of obstructive CAD in down-classified patients was 3.2% compared to 7.1% in non-down-classified patients. A PMRS ≥34% was nonsignificantly associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction and death in the prognosis validation cohort (HR: 0.58 [95% CI: 0.29-1.18]; P = 0.13).For evaluating patients with suspected CAD, a combined use of traditional PTP and the PMRS correctly down-classified one-third of >5% to 15% PTP patients into a group with very low prevalence of obstructive CAD and adverse events. The proposed strategy may improve risk stratification and help reduce unneeded diagnostic testing.Copyright © 2022 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, hemodynamic targets for adequate resuscitation remain a challenge. The PCO2 gap and the ratio between PCO2 gap and the arteriovenous difference in oxygen (PCO2 gap/Da-vO2) are marker of peripheral hypoperfusion. We hypothesized that the PCO2 gap and the PCO2 gap/Da-vO2 ratio might be useful parameters in VA ECMO patients.We conducted an observational prospective study between September 2015 and February 2017. All consecutive patients >18 years of age who had been treated with peripheral VA ECMO for cardiac failure were included. We compared two groups of patients: patients who died of any cause under VA ECMO or in the 72 h following VA ECMO weaning (early death group)-and patients who survived VA ECMO weaning more than 72 h (surviving group). Blood samples were drawn from arterial and venous VA ECMO cannulas at H0, H6, and H24. The ability of PCO2 gap and PCO2 gap/Da-vO2 to discriminate between early mortality and surviving was studied using receiver operating characteristic curves analysis.We included 20 patients in surviving group and 29 in early death group. The PCO2 gap was higher in the early death group at H6 (7.4 mm Hg [5.7-10.1] vs. 5.9 mm Hg [3.8-9.2], P < 0.01). AUC for PCO2 gap at H6 was 0.76 (0.61-0.92), with a cutoff of 6.2 mm Hg. The PCO2 gap/Da-vO2 was higher in the early death group at H0 (2.1 [1.5-2.6] vs. 1.2 [0.9-2.4], P < 0.01) and at H6 (2.1 [1.3-2.6] vs. 1.0 [0.8-1.7], P < 0.01).

Therefore, the current study sought to investigate the role of non-invasive diagnostics as prognostic markers for failure of the systemic ventricle following Fontan procedure.This monocentric, longitudinal observational study included 60 patients with a median age of 24.5 (19-29) years, who were subjected to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and blood analysis. The primary endpoint of this study was decompensated heart failure with symptoms at rest, peripheral and/or pulmonary edema, and/or death.During a follow-up of 24 months, 5 patients died and 5 patients suffered from decompensated heart failure. Clinical (NYHA class, initial surgery), functional (VO2 peak, ejection fraction, cardiac index), circulating biomarkers (N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide), and imaging parameters (end diastolic volume index, end systolic volume index, mass-index, contractility, afterload) were significantly related to the primary endpoint. Multi-variate regression analysis identified afterload as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging as an independent predictor of the primary endpoint (hazard ratio 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.19-3.29, p = 0.009).We identified distinct parameters of cardiopulmonary exercise testing, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and blood testing as markers for future decompensated heart failure and death in patients with Fontan circulation. Importantly, our data also identify increased afterload as an independent predictor for increased morbidity and mortality. This parameter is easy to assess by non-invasive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Its modulation may represent a potential therapeutic approach target in these high-risk patients.",NA,1/05/2019,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1017/S1047951119000258,NA,0,0,,

To address this, we aimed to develop an automated sorting system (RetiSort) that accurately labels the type and laterality of retinal photographs.Cross-sectional study.RetiSort was developed with retinal photographs from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study.The development of RetiSort was composed of 3 steps: 2 deep-learning (DL) algorithms and 1 rule-based classifier. For step 1, a DL algorithm was developed to locate the optic disc, the ""landmark feature."" For step 2, based on the location of the optic disc derived from step 1, a rule-based classifier was developed to sort retinal photographs into 3 types: macular-centered, optic disc-centered, or related to other fields. Step 2 concurrently distinguished laterality (i.e., the left or right eye) of macular-centered photographs. For step 3, an additional DL algorithm was developed to differentiate the laterality of disc-centered photographs. Via the 3 steps, RetiSort sorted and labeled retinal images into (1) right macular-centered, (2) left macular-centered, (3) right optic disc-centered, (4) left optic disc-centered, and (5) images relating to other fields. Subsequently, the accuracy of RetiSort was evaluated on 5000 randomly selected retinal images from SEED as well as on 3 publicly available image databases (DIARETDB0, HEI-MED, and Drishti-GS). The main outcome measure was the accuracy for sorting of retinal photographs.RetiSort mislabeled 48 out of 5000 retinal images from SEED, representing an overall accuracy of 99.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 98.7-99.3). In external tests, RetiSort mislabeled 1, 0, and 2 images, respectively, from DIARETDB0, HEI-MED, and Drishti-GS, representing an accuracy of 99.2% (95% CI, 95.8-99.9), 100%, and 98.0% (95% CI, 93.1-99.8), respectively. Saliency maps consistently showed that the DL algorithm in step 3 required pixels in the central left lateral border and optic disc of optic disc-centered retinal photographs to differentiate the laterality.RetiSort is a highly accurate automated sorting system. It can aid in data preparation and has practical applications in DL research that uses retinal photographs.Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this review was to provide detailed clinical data on inflammatory and other biomarkers obtained from patients after acute knee trauma in order to (i) present a timeline of events that occur in the acute, subacute, and chronic post-traumatic phases and in PTOA, and (ii) to identify key factors present in the synovial fluid, serum/plasma and urine, leading to PTOA of the knee in 23-50% of individuals who had acute knee trauma. In this context, we additionally discuss methods of simulating knee trauma and inflammation in in vivo, ex vivo articular cartilage explant and in vitro chondrocyte models, and answer whether these models are representative of the clinical inflammatory stages following knee trauma. Moreover, we compare the pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations used in such models and demonstrate that, compared to concentrations in the synovial fluid after knee trauma, they are exceedingly high. We then used the Bradford Hill Framework to present evidence that TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines are causal factors, while IL-1β and IL-17 are credible factors in inducing knee PTOA disease progresssion.

This review is framed around the 8 best practice advice points agreed upon by the authors, based on the results of randomized controlled trials, observational studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as well expert consensus in this field. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: After an unrevealing initial evaluation, endoscopic ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic test for unexplained acute and recurrent pancreatitis. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast and cholangiopancreatography is a reasonable complementary or alternative test to endoscopic ultrasound, based on local expertise and availability. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: The role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for reducing the frequency of acute pancreatitis episodes in patients with pancreas divisum is controversial, but minor papilla endotherapy may be considered, particularly for those with objective signs of outflow obstruction, such as a dilated dorsal pancreatic duct and/or santorinicele. There is no role for ERCP to treat pain alone in patients with pancreas divisum. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: The role of ERCP for reducing the frequency of pancreatitis episodes in patients with unexplained recurrent acute pancreatitis and standard pancreatic ductal anatomy is controversial and should only be considered after a comprehensive discussion of the uncertain benefits and potentially severe procedure-related adverse events. When pursued, ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy alone may be preferable to dual sphincterotomy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Surgical intervention should be considered over endoscopic therapy for long-term treatment of patients with painful obstructive chronic pancreatitis. Endoscopic intervention is a reasonable alternative to surgery for suboptimal operative candidates or those who favor a less invasive approach, assuming they are clearly informed that the best practice advice primarily favors surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: When ERCP is pursued, small (≤5mm) main pancreatic duct stones can be treated with pancreatography and conventional stone extraction maneuvers. For larger stones, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy and/or pancreatoscopy with intraductal lithotripsy may be required. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When ERCP is pursued, prolonged stent therapy (6-12 months) is effective for treating symptoms and remodeling main pancreatic duct strictures. The preferred approach is to place and sequentially add multiple plastic stents in parallel (upsizing); emerging evidence suggests that fully covered self-expanding metal stents may have a role for this indication, but additional research is necessary. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: ERCP with stent insertion is the preferred treatment for benign biliary stricture due to chronic pancreatitis. FCSEMS placement is favored over multiple plastic stents whenever feasible, given similar efficacy but significantly reduced need for stent exchange procedures during the treatment course. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Celiac plexus block should not be routinely performed for the management of pain due to chronic pancreatitis. The decision to proceed with celiac plexus block in selected patients with debilitating pain in whom other therapeutic measures have failed can be considered on a case-by-case basis, but only after discussion of the unclear outcomes of this intervention and its procedural risks.Copyright © 2022 AGA Institute.

The first aim of this study was to develop a risk stratification score for sepsis based upon vital signs and biomarkers using a statistical approach. Second, we aimed to validate the Rapid Emergency Triage and Treatment System (RETTS) for sepsis. RETTS combines vital signs with symptoms for risk stratification.We retrospectively analysed data from two prospective, observational, multicentre cohorts of patients from studies of biomarkers in ED. A candidate risk stratification score called Sepsis Heparin-binding protein-based Early Warning Score (SHEWS) was constructed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operator (LASSO) method. SHEWS and RETTS were compared to National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) for infection-related organ dysfunction, intensive care or death within the first 72h after admission (i.e. sepsis).506 patients with a diagnosed infection constituted cohort A, in which SHEWS was derived and RETTS was validated. 435 patients constituted cohort B of whom 184 had a diagnosed infection where both scores were validated.

High-quality evidence to inform optimal surveillance strategies is lacking. Machine learning demonstrates promise in accurate outcome prediction for a variety of health conditions. The purpose of this study was to utilise readily available patient, tumour, and treatment data to develop, validate and externally test machine learning models for predicting recurrence, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years from treatment.A retrospective, multicentre study of patients receiving curative-intent radiotherapy for NSCLC was undertaken. A total of 657 patients from 5 hospitals were eligible for inclusion. Data pre-processing derived 34 features for predictive modelling. Combinations of 8 feature reduction methods and 10 machine learning classification algorithms were compared, producing risk-stratification models for predicting recurrence, RFS and OS. Models were compared with 10-fold cross validation and an external test set and benchmarked against TNM-stage and performance status. Youden Index was derived from validation set ROC curves to distinguish high and low risk groups and Kaplan-Meier analyses performed.Median follow-up time was 852 days. Parameters were well matched across training-validation and external test sets: Mean age was 73 and 71 respectively, and recurrence, RFS and OS rates at 2 years were 43% vs 34%, 54% vs 47% and 54% vs 47% respectively. The respective validation and test set AUCs were as follows: 1) RFS: 0·682 (0·575-0·788) and 0·681 (0·597-0·766), 2) Recurrence: 0·687 (0·582-0·793) and 0·722 (0·635-0·81), and 3) OS: 0·759 (0·663-0·855) and 0·717 (0·634-0·8). Our models were superior to TNM stage and performance status in predicting recurrence and OS.This robust and ready to use machine learning method, validated and externally tested, sets the stage for future clinical trials entailing quantitative personalised risk-stratification and surveillance following curative-intent radiotherapy for NSCLC.A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Early identification is essential and relapse prevention remains a primary treatment goal for long-term management of schizophrenia. With the ubiquity of devices such as smartphones, objective digital biomarkers can be harnessed and may offer alternative means for symptom monitoring and relapse prediction. The acceptability of digital sensors (smartphone and wrist-wearable device) and the association between the captured digital data with clinical and health outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia will be examined.In this study, we aim to recruit 100 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who are recently discharged from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Singapore. Participants are followed up for 6 months, where digital, clinical, cognitive and functioning data are collected while health utilisation data are obtained at the 6 month and 1 year timepoint from study enrolment. Associations between digital, clinical and health outcomes data will be examined. A data-driven machine learning approach will be used to develop prediction algorithms to detect clinically significant outcomes. Study findings will inform the design, data collection procedures and protocol of future interventional randomised controlled trial, testing the effectiveness of digital phenotyping in clinical management of individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.Ethics approval has been granted by the National Healthcare Group (NHG) Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB Reference no.: 2019/00720).

This is despite previous presentations to primary care with symptoms. We aimed to test an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm applied to a single-lead ECG, recorded during ECG-enabled stethoscope examination, to validate a potential point-of-care screening tool for LVEF of 40% or lower.We conducted an observational, prospective, multicentre study of a convolutional neural network (known as AI-ECG) that was previously validated for the detection of reduced LVEF using 12-lead ECG as input. We used AI-ECG retrained to interpret single-lead ECG input alone. Patients (aged ≥18 years) attending for transthoracic echocardiogram in London (UK) were recruited. All participants had 15 s of supine, single-lead ECG recorded at the four standard anatomical positions for cardiac auscultation, plus one handheld position, using an ECG-enabled stethoscope. Transthoracic echocardiogram-derived percentage LVEF was used as ground truth. The primary outcome was performance of AI-ECG at classifying reduced LVEF (LVEF ≤40%), measured using metrics including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity, with two-sided 95% CIs. The primary outcome was reported for each position individually and with an optimal combination of AI-ECG outputs (interval range 0-1) from two positions using a rule-based approach and several classification models. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04601415.Between Feb 6 and May 27, 2021, we recruited 1050 patients (mean age 62 years [SD 17·4], 535 [51%] male, 432 [41%] non-White). 945 (90%) had an ejection fraction of at least 40%, and 105 (10%) had an ejection fraction of 40% or lower. Across all positions, ECGs were most frequently of adequate quality for AI-ECG interpretation at the pulmonary position (979 [93·3%] of 1050). Quality was lowest for the aortic position (846 [80·6%]). AI-ECG performed best at the pulmonary valve position (p=0·02), with an AUROC of 0·85 (95% CI 0·81-0·89), sensitivity of 84·8% (76·2-91·3), and specificity of 69·5% (66·4-72·6). Diagnostic odds ratios did not differ by age, sex, or non-White ethnicity. Taking the optimal combination of two positions (pulmonary and handheld positions), the rule-based approach resulted in an AUROC of 0·85 (0·81-0·89), sensitivity of 82·7% (72·7-90·2), and specificity of 79·9% (77·0-82·6). Using AI-ECG outputs from these two positions, a weighted logistic regression with l2 regularisation resulted in an AUROC of 0·91 (0·88-0·95), sensitivity of 91·9% (78·1-98·3), and specificity of 80·2% (75·5-84·3).A deep learning system applied to single-lead ECGs acquired during a routine examination with an ECG-enabled stethoscope can detect LVEF of 40% or lower. These findings highlight the potential for inexpensive, non-invasive, workflow-adapted, point-of-care screening, for earlier diagnosis and prognostically beneficial treatment.NHS Accelerated Access Collaborative, NHSX, and the National Institute for Health Research.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

This multicenter observational study evaluated the short-term clinical outcomes in recipients with acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to COVID-19. Out of 452 recipients following up at five centers, 50 had AKI secondary to COVID-19. 42 recipients with at least 3-month follow-up were included. Median follow-up was 5.23 months [IQR 4.09-6.99]. Severe COVID-19 was seen in 21 (50%), and 12 (28.6%) had KDIGO stage 3 AKI. Complete recovery of graft function at 3 months was seen in 17 (40.5%) patients. Worsening of proteinuria was seen in 15 (37.5%) patients, and 4 (9.5%) patients had new onset proteinuria. Graft failure was seen in 6 (14.3%) patients. Kidney biopsy revealed acute tubular injury (9/11 patients), thrombotic microangiopathy (2/11), acute cellular rejection (2/11), and chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (3/11). Patients with incomplete recovery were likely to have lower eGFR and proteinuria at baseline, historical allograft rejection, higher admission SOFA score, orthostatic hypotension, and KDIGO stage 3 AKI. Baseline proteinuria and the presence of orthostatic hypotension independently predicted incomplete graft recovery. This shows that graft recovery may remain incomplete after AKI secondary to COVID-19.© 2021 Steunstichting ESOT.

However, the clinical characteristics of NHCAP are still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to clarify its clinical characteristics.This multicenter prospective observational study included 596 patients with NHCAP from 73 centers in Japan between May 2014 and February 2016.Patient background was characterized by an older age (81.5 ± 10.1 years), most patients had complications (94.1%), and many patients had a high probability of aspiration pneumonia (68.6%). Among the isolates, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common (12.7%), while Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also isolated at 10.8%. The overall 30-day mortality rate for patients was 11.9%, and the factors affecting mortality were non-ambulatory status, high blood urea nitrogen level, impaired consciousness, and low albumin level. Sulbactam/ampicillin was the most commonly administered antibiotic, including in groups with high severity of illness and high risk of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Both the A-DROP and I-ROAD scores were useful in predicting the prognosis of NHCAP. Confirmation of intention to provide do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) instructions was given to 333 patients (55.9%), and 313 patients agreed to DNAR instructions.NHCAP tends to occur in elderly patients with underlying diseases. The risk of MDR pathogens and the mortality rate are intermediate for community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Decreased renal function is associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure or sepsis. In this study, the association between renal function (reflected by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the time of admission) and clinical outcome was evaluated.Data was used from a prospective, multi-national, observational cohort of patients treated in three medical emergency departments of tertiary care centers. The eGFR was calculated from the creatinine at the time of admission (using the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration equation,CKD-EPI). Uni- and multivariate regression models were used for eGFR and 30-day mortality, in hospital mortality, length of stay and intensive care unit admission rate.6983 patients were included. The 30-day mortality was 1.8%, 3.5%, 6.9%, 11.1%, 13.6%, and 14.2% in patients with eGFR of above 90, 60-89, 45-59, 30-44, 15-29, and <15 ml/min/1.73m2, respectively. Using multivariate regression, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 2.31 (for 15-29 ml/min/1.73m2, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 3.90, p = 0.002) and 3.73 (for eGFR <15ml/min/1.73m2 as compared to >90 ml/min/1.73m2, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.84, p<0.001). For 10 ml/min/1.73m2 decrease in eGFR the OR for the 30-day mortality was 1.15 (95% CI1.09 to 1.22, p<0.001).The eGFR was also significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, the percentage of ICU-admissions, and with a longer hospital stay. No association was found with hospital readmission within 30 days. As limitations, only eGFR at admission was available and the number of patients on hemodialysis was unknown.Reduced eGFR at the time of admission is a strong and independent predictor for adverse outcome in this large population of patients admitted to medical emergency departments.",NA,7/04/2020,D016428;D016448;D064888;D013485,10.1371/journal.pone.0230998,10.5061/dryad.71638rk,0,0,,

With a large proportion of patients referred to Hospital Eye Services (HES) for diagnostics and disease management, the referral process results in unnecessary referrals from erroneous diagnoses and delays in access to appropriate treatment. A potential solution is a teleophthalmology digital referral pathway linking community optometry and HES.The HERMES study (Teleophthalmology-enabled and artificial intelligence-ready referral pathway for community optometry referrals of retinal disease: a cluster randomised superiority trial with a linked diagnostic accuracy study) is a cluster randomised clinical trial for evaluating the effectiveness of a teleophthalmology referral pathway between community optometry and HES for retinal diseases. Nested within HERMES is a diagnostic accuracy study, which assesses the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) decision support system (DSS) for automated diagnosis and referral recommendation. A postimplementation, observational substudy, a within-trial economic evaluation and discrete choice experiment will assess the feasibility of implementation of both digital technologies within a real-life setting. Patients with a suspicion of retinal disease, undergoing eye examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, will be recruited across 24 optometry practices in the UK. Optometry practices will be randomised to standard care or teleophthalmology. The primary outcome is the proportion of false-positive referrals (unnecessary HES visits) in the current referral pathway compared with the teleophthalmology referral pathway. OCT scans will be interpreted by the AI DSS, which provides a diagnosis and referral decision and the primary outcome for the AI diagnostic study is diagnostic accuracy of the referral decision made by the Moorfields-DeepMind AI system. Secondary outcomes relate to inappropriate referral rate, cost-effectiveness analyses and human-computer interaction (HCI) analyses.Ethical approval was obtained from the London-Bromley Research Ethics Committee (REC 20/LO/1299).

Of the patients, 32 (24%) experienced NIV failure. Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 4.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-12.22), older age (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08), a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.36), and a procalcitonin level greater than 3.8 ng/mL (OR, 6.28; 95% CI, 2.04-19.31) were independently associated with NIV failure. The receiver operating characteristic curves for predicting NIV failure were 0.67, 0.72, and 0.76 tested by age, procalcitonin, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, respectively. From initiation to 24 hours, the patients in the NIV failure group had a higher proportion of Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 14 or less, a higher proportion of pH ≤7.35, and higher respiratory rates than ones in the successful NIV group.One of 4 SAP patients experience NIV failure.

In a longitudinal study of adult burns patients, we recently demonstrated that a combined measurement of neutrophil phagocytic capacity, immature granulocyte (IG) count and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels on the day of injury gave good discriminatory power for the prediction of later sepsis development. However, limited by a small sample size, single-centre design and focus on adult burns patients, these biomarkers require prospective validation in a larger patient cohort. The Scientific Investigation of the Biological Pathways Following Thermal Injury-2 study aims to prospectively validate neutrophil phagocytic activity, IG count and plasma cfDNA levels as early prognostic biomarkers of sepsis in thermally injured adult and paediatric patients.This multicentre, longitudinal, observational cohort study will enrol 245 paediatric and adult patients with moderate to severe burns within 24 hours of injury. Blood samples will be obtained at 19 postinjury time points (days 1-14, day 28, months 3, 6, 12 and 24) and analysed for neutrophil phagocytic activity, IG count and cfDNA levels. Patients will be screened daily for sepsis using the 2007 American Burn Association diagnostic criteria for sepsis. In addition, daily multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Scores will be recorded relationships between neutrophil phagocytic activity, IG count and plasma cfDNA levels on day 1 of injury and the development of sepsis will be examined using logistic regression models.This study received ethics approval from the West Midlands, Coventry and Warwickshire Research Ethics Committee (REC reference:16/WM/0217).

Myocardial I/R model was established by occluding the left anterior descending artery for 30 min followed by 120 min of reperfusion. SMJ was injected intraperitoneally at the onset of 120 min of reperfusion, and erastin (an agonist of ferroptosis), ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, an inhibitor of ferroptosis) and ML385 (an inhibitor of nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)) were administered intraperitoneally separately 30 min before myocardial ischemia as different pretreatments. Cardiac function before ischemia, after ischemia and after reperfusion was analysed. Pathological changes in the myocardium and the ultrastructure of cardiomyocytes were observed, and the myocardial infarction area was measured. Additionally, the concentration of Fe2+ in heart tissues and the levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), troponin I (cTnl), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum were measured using assay kits, and the expressions of Nrf2, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) were examined by Western blot.Compared with the sham group, I/R significantly injured heart tissues, as evidenced by the disordered, ruptured and oedematous myocardial fibres; the increases in infarct size, serum CK-MB, cTnI and MDA levels, and myocardial Fe2+ concentrations; and the decreases in SOD activity (P<0.05). These results were accompanied by ultrastructural alterations to the mitochondria, increased expression of ACSL4 and inhibited the activation of Nrf2/GPX4 signalling (P<0.05). Compared with I/R group, pretreatment with 9 mL/kg SMJ and 2 mg/kg Fer-1 significantly reduced myocardial I/R injury, Fe2+ concentrations and ACSL4 expression and attenuated mitochondrial impairment, while 14 mg/kg erastin exacerbated myocardial I/R injury (P<0.05). In addition, cardioprotection provided by 9 mL/kg SMJ was completely reversed by ML385, as evidenced by the increased myocardial infarct size, CK-MB, cTnI, MDA and Fe2+ concentrations, and the decreased SOD activity (P<0.05).Ferroptosis is involved in myocardial I/R injury. Pretreatment with SMJ alleviated myocardial I/R injury by activating Nrf2/GPX4 signalling-mediated ferroptosis, thereby providing a strategy for the prevention and treatment of ischemic heart diseases.© 2022.

Pooling individual participant data, including unanalyzed data from trials terminated early, enables more detailed investigation of the efficacy and safety of HCQ/CQ among subgroups of hospitalized patients.We searched ClinicalTrials.gov in May and June 2020 for US-based RCTs evaluating HCQ/CQ in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in which the outcomes defined in this study were recorded or could be extrapolated. The primary outcome was a 7-point ordinal scale measured between day 28 and 35 post enrollment; comparisons used proportional odds ratios. Harmonized de-identified data were collected via a common template spreadsheet sent to each principal investigator. The data were analyzed by fitting a prespecified Bayesian ordinal regression model and standardizing the resulting predictions.Eight of 19 trials met eligibility criteria and agreed to participate. Patient-level data were available from 770 participants (412 HCQ/CQ vs 358 control). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. We did not find evidence of a difference in COVID-19 ordinal scores between days 28 and 35 post-enrollment in the pooled patient population (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% credible interval, 0.76-1.24; higher favors HCQ/CQ), and found no convincing evidence of meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity among prespecified subgroups. Adverse event and serious adverse event rates were numerically higher with HCQ/CQ vs control (0.39 vs 0.29 and 0.13 vs 0.09 per patient, respectively).The findings of this individual participant data meta-analysis reinforce those of individual RCTs that HCQ/CQ is not efficacious for treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.",U01 HL123010|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL123018|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL123023|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U24 TR001609|NCATS NIH HHS|United States|UL1 TR002541|NCATS NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL122989|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL123008|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL123027|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL123033|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL123022|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|UL1 TR002345|NCATS NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL123004|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL123031|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL123020|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL123009|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States|U01 HL122998|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States,30/09/2022,D016428;D017418;D052061;D013485,10.1371/journal.pone.0273526,NA,1,1,,

This option may be attractive in patients with NVAF and chronic kidney disease (CKD), since they exhibit both high thromboembolic and bleeding risks.To evaluate the prognostic impact of the presence of CKD in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing LAAC peri-procedure and during the follow-up as compared with patients with preserved renal function.Retrospective, observational study that included 124 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing LAAC in a university hospital, and the results were evaluated according to the baseline renal function of the patients.The median age was 75,5 years (IQR 67,6-80) and 62,1% were men, the median of CHA2DS2-Vasc and HASBLED scores was 4 (IQR 3-4) for both scores. Up to 57,3% of the total sample had CKD. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, but CKD patients were older and had a higher HASBLED score. During the procedure, no thromboembolic, bleeding events, or deaths were observed. Combining the time of hospitalization and follow-up, no significant differences were observed between groups in the annual rate of thromboembolic events (0.97/100 patient-years [100PY] vs 4.06/100PY, P =,09), but there was a higher rate of bleeding events (5.67/100PY vs. 13.3/100PY, P =,033) and mortality among CKD patients (6.50/100PY vs. 17.2/100PY, P =,009), with an odds ratio of 2.711 (95% CI 1,96-6,95). In the multivariate analysis a preserved eGFR was independently associated with a lower mortality risk.LAAC is a valid alternative to oral anticoagulation in patients with CKD and atrial fibrillation, with a low rate of peri- and post-procedure complications, although CKD patients exhibited a higher risk of bleeding and mortality during the follow-up. However, these higher rates may not be necessarily related to the procedure.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier España, S.L.U.",NA,11/10/2022,D016428;D064888,10.1016/j.nefroe.2022.05.006,NA,1,1,,

A Monte Carlo simulation incorporating a treatment algorithm adding sequentially a statin, ezetimibe, and a PCSK9i was applied with consideration of partial and total statin intolerance. The need for PCSK9i was calculated for three different ESC recommendations (2019 guidelines, 2016 guidelines, 2017 consensus update). Preventable events and treatment costs due to PCSK9i were calculated for a range of annual event rates from 2% to 8% and annual treatment costs of ca. 6050 €. We included 1780 patients (mean age 69.5 years). Median LDL-C at baseline was 85.0 mg/dL, with 61% of patients taking lipid-lowering medication. The need for PCSK9i was simulated to be 42.0% (ESC 2019), 31.9% (ESC 2016), and 5.0% (ESC 2017). The LDL-C goals were achieved in 97.9%, 99.1%, and 60.9% of patients, respectively. Annual treatment cost for PCSK9i per 1 000 000 ASCVD patients would be 2.54 billion € (ESC 2019) compared to 0.30 billion € (ESC 2017). Costs per prevented event due to PCSK9i initiation differed widely, e.g. 887 000 € for an event rate of 3% and a treatment goal of <55 mg/dL compared to 205 000 € for an event rate of 7% and risk-based use of PCSK9i.The revised LDL-C treatment goals increase the projected need for PCSK9i with a substantial increase in associated treatment cost. An allocation strategy based on residual LDL-C and clinical or angiographic risk factors leads to a more tailored target population for PCSK9i with a reasonable benefit/cost ratio.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between NOAF complicating AMI and HF hospitalization.Adult AMI patients identified in the New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation Complicating Acute Myocardial Infarction in Shanghai registry who, discharged alive, had complete echocardiography and follow-up data from February 2014 to March 2018 were included. Patients were divided according to the presence of NOAF. The outcome measures were HF hospitalization and death during the observational period (until 10 April 2019). Cox proportional hazard models were performed in the whole population and propensity score-matched (PSM) cohort to assess the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Overall, 2075 patients (mean age: 65.2 ± 12.3 years, 77.3% were men) with AMI were analysed, of whom 228 (11.0%) developed NOAF. Advanced age, admission HF (Killip II-IV), impaired renal function, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, increased heart rate, and left atrial enlargement were independent predictors of NOAF. Over a median observational period of 2.7 years, the annual incidence rates of HF hospitalization were 18.4% and 2.8% for patients with NOAF and sinus rhythm, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, NOAF was significantly associated with HF hospitalization (HR: 3.14, 95% CI: 2.30-4.28, P < 0.001). Similar results were obtained when accounting for the competing risk of all-cause death (subdistribution HR: 3.06, 95% CI: 2.18-4.30, P < 0.001) or from the PSM cohort (HR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.99-4.00, P < 0.001). Patients with persistent NOAF (HR: 5.81, 95% CI: 3.59-9.41) were at significantly higher risk of HF hospitalization when compared with those with transient one (HR: 2.61, 95% CI: 1.84-3.70, P interaction = 0.008). Although post-MI NOAF was significantly related to cardiovascular death (annual incidence rates for NOAF and sinus rhythm were 9.4% and 2.3%, respectively; HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.36-2.85, P < 0.001), such an association was attenuated when HF hospitalization (modelled as a time-varying covariate) and antithrombotic treatment were adjusted (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.92-2.02, P = 0.121).In patients with AMI, NOAF is strongly associated with an increased long-term risk of HF hospitalization. Our findings suggest that strengthened secondary prevention of HF should be considered in this high-risk population.© 2020 The Authors.

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) obtained using a wireless high-resolution oximeter with a built-in accelerometer linked to a smartphone with automated cloud analysis, Overnight Digital Monitoring (ODM), is a reliable method for the diagnosis of OSA.Consecutive patients referred to the sleep laboratory with suspected OSA underwent in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) and simultaneous ODM. The PSG apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was analyzed using the criteria recommended and accepted by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) for the definition of hypopnea: arousal or ≥3% O2 desaturation (PSG-AHI3%) and ≥4% O2 desaturation (PSG-AHI4%), respectively. The results of PSG and ODM were compared by drawing parallels between the PSG-AHI3% and PSG-AHI4% with ODM-ODI3% and ODM-ODI4%, respectively. Bland-Altman plots, intraclass correlation, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analyses were conducted for statistical evaluation.

However, anticoagulation with DOACs is now preferred over warfarin as thromboprophylaxis in AF.Patients with AF enrolled in the Amulet Observational Registry (n = 1,088) who had successful LAAO with the Amplatzer Amulet device (n = 1,078) were compared with a propensity score-matched control cohort of incident AF patients (n = 1,184) treated by DOACs identified from Danish national patient registries. Propensity score matching was based on the covariates of the CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, sex category) and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal or liver function, stroke, bleeding, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs or alcohol) scores for predicting stroke and bleeding. The primary outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke, major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ≥3), or all-cause mortality, and follow-up was 2 years.AF patients treated with LAAO had a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome as compared with patients treated with DOACs (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49 to 0.67). Total events and event rates per 100 patient-years were (LAAO vs. DOACs) 256 vs. 461 and 14.5 vs. 25.7, respectively. The risk of ischemic stroke was comparable between groups (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.75), while risk of major bleeding (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.79) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.64) were significantly lower in patients treated with LAAO.Among high-risk AF patients, LAAO in comparison with DOACs may have similar stroke prevention efficacy but lower risk of major bleeding and mortality.Copyright © 2021 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

We aimed to determine if diuretic use in preterm infants was associated with improved pulmonary outcomes, but poorer weight gain.An observational study over a 5 year period was undertaken of all infants born at less than 29 weeks of gestation and alive at discharge in all neonatal units in England who received consecutive diuretic use for at least 7 days. Postnatal weight gain and home supplementary oxygen requirement were the outcomes. A literature review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and crossover studies was undertaken to determine if diuretic usage was associated with changes in lung mechanics and oxygenation, duration of supplementary oxygen and requirement for home supplementary oxygen.In the observational study, 9,457 infants survived to discharge, 44.6% received diuretics for at least 7 days. Diuretic use was associated with an increased probability of supplementary home oxygen of 0.14 and an increase in weight gain of 2.5 g/week. In the review, seven of the 10 studies reported improvements only in short term lung mechanics. There was conflicting evidence regarding whether diuretics resulted in short term improvements in oxygenation.Diuretic use was not associated with a reduction in requirement for supplemental oxygen on discharge. The literature review highlighted a lack of RCTs assessing meaningful long-term clinical outcomes. Randomised trials are needed to determine the long-term risk benefit ratio of chronic diuretic use.© 2021 Emma E.

Previous studies of MR-proADM have primarily focussed on bacterial infections. A limited number of small and monocentric studies have examined MR-proADM as a prognostic factor in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, however there is need for multicenter validation. An evaluation of its utility in predicting need for hospitalisation in viral infections was also performed.An observational retrospective analysis of 1861 patients, with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by RT-qPCR, from 10 hospitals across Europe was performed. Biomarkers, taken upon presentation to Emergency Departments (ED), clinical scores, patient demographics and outcomes were collected. Multiclass random forest classifier models were generated as well as calculation of area under the curve analysis. The primary endpoint was hospital admission with and without death.Patients suitable for safe discharge from Emergency Departments could be identified through an MR-proADM value of ≤ 1.02 nmol/L in combination with a CRP (C-Reactive Protein) of ≤ 20.2 mg/L and age ≤ 64, or in combination with a SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score < 2 if MR-proADM was ≤ 0.83 nmol/L regardless of age. Those at an increased risk of mortality could be identified upon presentation to secondary care with an MR-proADM value of > 0.85 nmol/L, in combination with a SOFA score ≥ 2 and LDH > 720 U/L, or in combination with a CRP > 29.26 mg/L and age ≤ 64, when MR-proADM was > 1.02 nmol/L.This international study suggests that for patients presenting to the ED with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, MR-proADM in combination with age and CRP or with the patient's SOFA score could identify patients at low risk where outpatient treatment may be safe.© 2022.

We determined whether early recognition of subclinical rejection has long-term consequences for kidney allograft survival in an observational prospective cohort study of 1307 consecutive nonselected patients who underwent ABO-compatible, complement-dependent cytotoxicity-negative crossmatch kidney transplantation in Paris (2000-2010). Participants underwent prospective screening biopsies at 1 year post-transplant, with concurrent evaluations of graft complement deposition and circulating anti-HLA antibodies. The main analysis included 1001 patients. Three distinct groups of patients were identified at the 1-year screening: 727 (73%) patients without rejection, 132 (13%) patients with subclinical T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), and 142 (14%) patients with subclinical antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). Patients with subclinical ABMR had the poorest graft survival at 8 years post-transplant (56%) compared with subclinical TCMR (88%) and nonrejection (90%) groups (P<0.001). In a multivariate Cox model, subclinical ABMR at 1 year was independently associated with a 3.5-fold increase in graft loss (95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 5.7) along with eGFR and proteinuria (P<0.001). Subclinical ABMR was associated with more rapid progression to transplant glomerulopathy. Of patients with subclinical TCMR at 1 year, only those who further developed de novo donor-specific antibodies and transplant glomerulopathy showed higher risk of graft loss compared with patients without rejection. Our findings suggest that subclinical TCMR and subclinical ABMR have distinct effects on long-term graft loss. Subclinical ABMR detected at the 1-year screening biopsy carries a prognostic value independent of initial donor-specific antibody status, previous immunologic events, current eGFR, and proteinuria.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society of Nephrology.",NA,4/01/2015,D003160;D016428;D064888,10.1681/ASN.2014040399,NA,1,0,,

All the patients included in the study had undergone a diagnostic coronary angiography before ICD implantation. The variable prior ventricular arrhythmias (VA+) was positive in patients with secondary prevention ICDs and in those with at least one appropriate ICD therapy after primary prevention implantation.During a median follow-up of 42 months 59 patients (9%) suffered ES. The presence of at least one IRACTO not revascularized (IRACTO-NR) was associated with a significantly higher cumulative incidence of ES (14.5% vs 4.8%, p < 0.001). IRACTO-NR maintained a significant association with ES after adjustment for potential confounders (HR 2.3, p = 0.005) and was an independent predictor of ES together with VA+ and LVEF. The best cut-off of LVEF to predict ES was ≤38%. A risk-prediction model based on IRACTO-NR, VA+ and LVEF≤38% identified three categories of ES risk (low, intermediate and high), with progressively increasing cumulative incidence of ES (2.2%, 9% and 20%).In a cohort of patients with prior MI and ICD, IRACTO-NR is an independent predictor of ES. A new risk-prediction model allowed the identification of three categories of risk, with potentially important clinical implications.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Oral anticoagulation can reduce stroke risk but is limited by complication risk and non-compliance. Left atrial appendage exclusion (LAAE) is a new surgical option to reduce stroke risk in AF. The study objective was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of standalone thoracoscopic LAAE in high stroke risk AF patients.This was a retrospective, multicentre study of high stroke risk AF patients who had oral anticoagulation contraindications and were not candidates for ablation nor other cardiac surgery. Standalone thoracoscopic LAAE was performed using 3 unilateral ports access and epicardial clip. Periprocedural adverse events, long-term observational clinical outcomes and stroke rate were evaluated.Procedural success was 99.4% (174/175 patients). Pleural effusion occurred in 4 (2.3%) patients; other periprocedural complications were <1% each. One perioperative haemorrhagic stroke occurred (0.6%). No phrenic nerve palsy or cardiac tamponade occurred. Predicted annual ischaemic stroke rate of 4.8/100 patient-years (based on median CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4.0) was significantly higher than stroke risk observed in follow-up after LAAE. No ischaemic strokes occurred (median follow-up: 12.5 months), resulting in observed rate of 0 (95% CI 0-2.0)/100 patient-years (P < 0.001 versus predicted). Six all-cause (non-device-related) deaths occurred during follow-up.Study proved that a new surgical option, standalone thoracoscopic LAAE, is feasible and safe.

In 2009, Kulkarni et al created the ETV Success score to predict the outcome of ETV in children. The purpose of this study is to create a prognostic model to predict the success of ETV for adult patients with hydrocephalus. The ability to predict who will benefit from an ETV will allow better primary patient selection both for ETV and shunting. This would reduce additional second procedures due to primary treatment failure. A success score specific for adults could also be used as a communication tool to provide better information and guidance to patients.The study will adhere to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis reporting guidelines and conducted as a retrospective chart review of all patients≥18 years of age treated with ETV at the participating centres between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2018. Data collection is conducted locally in a standardised database. Univariate analysis will be used to identify several strong predictors to be included in a multivariate logistic regression model. The model will be validated using K-fold cross validation. Discrimination will be assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and calibration with calibration belt plots.The study is approved by appropriate ethics or patient safety boards in all participating countries.NCT04773938; Pre-results.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Traditionally this has required the use of dye-based chromoendoscopy (DBC). We sought to assess the accuracy and incremental benefit of DBC in addition to high-definition white-light imaging (HDWLI) and virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE) for the prediction of SMIC within LNPCPs.A prospective observational study of consecutive LNPCPs at a single tertiary referral center was performed. Before resection all lesions were assessed for the presence of a demarcated area (DA), defined as an area of disordered pit or microvascular pattern, by 2 trained endoscopists before and after DBC. Diagnostic performance characteristics were calculated with histology as the reference criterion standard, and overall agreement was calculated using the κ statistic.Over 39 months to March 2021, 400 consecutive LNPCPs (median lesion size, 35 mm; interquartile range, 25-45) were analyzed. The overall rate of SMIC was 6.5%. Presence of a DA had an accuracy of 91% (95% confidence interval, 87.7-93.5) for SMIC, independent of the use of DBC. The rate of interobserver agreement for presence of a DA using HDWLI + VCE was very high (κ = .96) with no benefit gained by the addition of DBC.The use of HDWLI and VCE is likely to be adequate for lesion assessment for the prediction of SMIC among LNPCPs. Further, the absence of a DA is strongly predictive for the absence of SMIC, independent to the use of DBC. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT03506321.).Crown Copyright © 2021.

We aimed to understand the inflammatory mechanism of budesonide in the treatment of early COVID-19.The STOIC trial was a randomised, open label, parallel group, phase 2 clinical intervention trial where patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive usual care (as needed antipyretics were only available treatment) or inhaled budesonide at a dose of 800 μg twice a day plus usual care. For this experimental analysis, we investigated the nasal mucosal inflammatory response in patients recruited to the STOIC trial and in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-negative healthy controls, recruited from a long-term observational data collection study at the University of Oxford. In patients with SARS-CoV-2 who entered the STOIC study, nasal epithelial lining fluid was sampled at day of randomisation (day 0) and at day 14 following randomisation, blood samples were also collected at day 28 after randomisation. Nasal epithelial lining fluid and blood samples were collected from the SARS-CoV-2 negative control cohort. Inflammatory mediators in the nasal epithelial lining fluid and blood were assessed for a range of viral response proteins, and innate and adaptive response markers using Meso Scale Discovery enzyme linked immunoassay panels. These samples were used to investigate the evolution of inflammation in the early COVID-19 disease course and assess the effect of budesonide on inflammation.146 participants were recruited in the STOIC trial (n=73 in the usual care group; n=73 in the budesonide group). 140 nasal mucosal samples were available at day 0 (randomisation) and 122 samples at day 14. At day 28, whole blood was collected from 123 participants (62 in the budesonide group and 61 in the usual care group). 20 blood or nasal samples were collected from healthy controls. In early COVID-19 disease, there was an enhanced inflammatory airway response with the induction of an anti-viral and T-helper 1 and 2 (Th1/2) inflammatory response compared with healthy individuals. Individuals with COVID-19 who clinically deteriorated (ie, who met the primary outcome) showed an early blunted respiratory interferon response and pronounced and persistent Th2 inflammation, mediated by CC chemokine ligand (CCL)-24, compared with those with COVID-19 who did not clinically deteriorate. Over time, the natural course of COVID-19 showed persistently high respiratory interferon concentrations and elevated concentrations of the eosinophil chemokine, CCL-11, despite clinical symptom improvement. There was persistent systemic inflammation after 28 days following COVID-19, including elevated concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, and CCL-11. Budesonide treatment modulated inflammation in the nose and blood and was shown to decrease IL-33 and increase CCL17. The STOIC trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04416399.An initial blunted interferon response and heightened T-helper 2 inflammatory response in the respiratory tract following SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a biomarker for predicting the development of severe COVID-19 disease. The clinical benefit of inhaled budesonide in early COVID-19 is likely to be as a consequence of its inflammatory modulatory effect, suggesting efficacy by reducing epithelial damage and an improved T-cell response.Oxford National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre and AstraZeneca.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Participants were randomized to augmentation of usual care with dosed exercise or health education intervention. Irritability, SI, and depression were measured every week with 5-item irritability domain of Concise Associated Symptom Tracking scale, 3-item suicidal thoughts factor of Concise Health Risk Tracking scale, and 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Clinician-Rated version (excluding the suicide-related item) respectively during acute-(baseline-to-week-12) and continuation-(week-12-to-week-36) phase. Covariates included age, sex, race, ethnicity, treatment arm, type of substance(s) used, and comorbid psychiatric and medical disorders.Higher irritability was associated with higher SI concurrently both in the acute-phase: r=0.28 (p<0.0001) and in the continuation-phase: r=0.33 (p<0.0001). Irritability was associated with concurrent SI after controlling for depression [acute-phase: β=0.17 (p<0.0001); continuation-phase: β=0.18 (p<0.0001)]. Greater baseline-to-week-2 reductions in irritability predicted lower levels of SI from week-2-to-week-12 (β=-0.11, p=0.003) and from week-12-to-week-36 (β=-0.22, p<0.0001) after controlling for baseline levels of depression and SI and baseline-to-week-2 changes in depression and SI.Secondary analyses, self-report measures of irritability and SI, limited generalizability.Irritability is associated with SI concurrently, and greater reductions in irritability earlier in treatment are associated with lower levels of subsequent SI. Therefore, targeting irritability may reduce suicidality in adults with stimulant use disorder.Copyright © 2021.

Radiographic abnormality was frequently associated irrespective of clinical presentation and its severity. Poor prognosis was noted in elderly, especially those with co-morbidities.Though the disease has a relatively mild course in this part of the subcontinent, patients aged ≥60 are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Clinical and laboratory findings are similar to those found in viral diseases. Increased risk of cardiac involvement needs to be looked into.

Multivariable grouped relative risk models assessed the effect of ACEi on time to hematuria adjusting for clinical factors and stratified by enrollment site. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for blood pressure was tested for association with hematuria in REQUITE and our Radiogenomics Consortium GWAS.Patients taking ACEi during radiotherapy had a reduced risk of hematuria (HR 0.51, 95%CI 0.28 to 0.94, p = 0.030) after adjusting for prior transurethral prostate and/or bladder resection, heart disease, pelvic node radiotherapy, and bladder volume receiving 70 Gy, which are associated with hematuria. A blood pressure PRS was associated with hypertension (odds ratio per standard deviation 1.38, 95%CI 1.31 to 1.46, n = 5,288, p < 0.001) but not hematuria (HR per standard deviation 0.96, 95%CI 0.87 to 1.06, n = 5,126, p = 0.41).Our study is the first to show a radioprotective effect of ACEi on bladder in an international, multi-site study of patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. Mechanistic studies are needed to understand how targeting the angiotensin pathway protects the bladder.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Data on the efficacy of catheter ablation of AF in HCM patients are sparse.Observational multicentre study in 137 HCM patients (mean age 55.0 ± 13.4, 29.1% female; 225 ablation procedures). We investigated (i) the efficacy of catheter ablation for AF beyond the initial 12 months; (ii) the available risk scores, stratification schemes and genotype as potential predictors of arrhythmia relapse, and (iii) the impact of cryoballoon vs. radiofrequency in procedural outcomes. Mean follow-up was 43.8 ± 37.0 months. Recurrences after the initial 12-month period post-ablation were frequent, and 24 months after the index procedure, nearly all patients with persistent AF had relapsed, and only 40% of those with paroxysmal AF remained free from arrhythmia recurrence. The APPLE score demonstrated a modest discriminative capacity for AF relapse post-ablation (c-statistic 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75; P = 0.022), while the risk stratification schemes for sudden death did not. On multivariable analysis, left atrium diameter and LV apical aneurysm were independent predictors of recurrence. Fifty-eight patients were genotyped; arrhythmia-free survival was similar among subjects with different gene mutations. Rate of procedural complications was high (9.3%), although reducing over time. Outcome for cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation was comparable.Very late AF relapses post-ablation is common in HCM patients, especially in those with persistent AF. Left atrium size, LV apical aneurysm, and the APPLE score might contribute to identify subjects at higher risk of arrhythmia recurrence. First-time cryoballoon is comparable with radiofrequency ablation.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2021.

Enrollment was from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, with a minimum patient follow-up of 2 years.Single fraction of 28 Gy (single-fraction arm) or 4 fractions of 12 Gy (multifraction arm) to each oligometastasis.The main outcome was grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurring within 1 year of SABR. Secondary outcomes were freedom from local failure, overall survival, disease-free survival, and patient-reported outcomes (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Lung Cancer and EuroQol 5-dimension visual analog scale).Ninety participants were randomized, of whom 87 were treated for 133 pulmonary oligometastases. The mean (SD) age was 66.6 [11.6] years; 58 (64%) were male. Median follow-up was 36.5 months (interquartile range, 24.8-43.9 months). The numbers of grade 3 or higher AEs related to treatment at 1 year were 2 (5%; 80% CI, 1%-13%) in the single-fraction arm and 1 (3%; 80% CI, 0%-10%) in the multifraction arm, with no significant difference observed between arms. One grade 5 AE occurred in the multifraction arm. No significant differences were found between the multifraction arm and single-fraction arm for freedom from local failure (hazard ratio [HR], 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-1.3; P = .13), overall survival (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.6-3.7; P = .44), or disease-free survival (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.6; P > .99).

Despite these studies, we found no trials investigating the relationship between NLR and fetal outcomes in PE patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between NLR and fetal outcomes.We retrospectively analyzed the demographic data and laboratory tests to determine the NLR of 175 pregnant women with severe PE admitted to our clinic between January 2015 and December 2018.NLR in the first (2.4 ± 1.1 vs 2.9 ± 1.4, P = 0.18) and second trimesters (3.6 ± 0.7 vs 3.8 ± 1.3, P = 0.25) were not different between the groups, but third trimester NLR was significantly higher in patients with fetal loss (6.5 ± 5.4 vs 4.2 ± 2.7, P = 0.009).

When suspected, cervical MRI helps to reveal spinal cord compression and rules out alternative diagnoses. However, the correlation between radiological findings and symptoms is weak. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) analysis may complement the appreciation of cord compression and be used for intraoperative and postoperative monitorings in patients undergoing surgical decompression.Twenty patients diagnosed with DCM undergoing surgical decompression will receive standardised lumbar CSFP monitoring immediately before, during and 24 hours after operation. Rest (ie, opening pressure, CSF pulsation) and stimulated (ie, Valsalva, Queckenstedt's) CSFP-findings in DCM will be compared with 20 controls and results from CSFP monitoring will be related to clinical and neurophysiological findings. Arterial blood pressure will be recorded perioperatively and postoperatively to calculate spinal cord perfusion pressure and spinal vascular reactivity index. Furthermore, measures of CSFP will be compared with markers of spinal cord compression by means of MR imaging.The study protocol conformed to the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Zurich (KEK-ZH number PB-2016-00623). The main publications from this study will cover the CSFP fluid dynamics and pressure analysis preoperative, perioperative and postoperative correlated with imaging, clinical scores and neurophysiology.

However, acute DoC is rarely investigated, although identifying residual consciousness is key to clinical decision-making in the intensive care unit (ICU). Therefore, the objective of the prospective, observational, tertiary centre cohort, diagnostic phase IIb study 'Consciousness in neurocritical care cohort study using EEG and fMRI' (CONNECT-ME, NCT02644265) was to assess the accuracy of fMRI and EEG to identify residual consciousness in acute DoC in the ICU. Between April 2016 and November 2020, 87 acute DoC patients with traumatic or non-traumatic brain injury were examined with repeated clinical assessments, fMRI and EEG. Resting-state EEG and EEG with external stimulations were evaluated by visual analysis, spectral band analysis and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) consciousness classifier. In addition, within- and between-network resting-state connectivity for canonical resting-state fMRI networks was assessed. Next, we used EEG and fMRI data at study enrolment in two different machine-learning algorithms (Random Forest and SVM with a linear kernel) to distinguish patients in a minimally conscious state or better (≥MCS) from those in coma or unresponsive wakefulness state (≤UWS) at time of study enrolment and at ICU discharge (or before death). Prediction performances were assessed with area under the curve (AUC). Of 87 DoC patients (mean age, 50.0 ± 18 years, 43% female), 51 (59%) were ≤UWS and 36 (41%) were ≥ MCS at study enrolment. Thirty-one (36%) patients died in the ICU, including 28 who had life-sustaining therapy withdrawn. EEG and fMRI predicted consciousness levels at study enrolment and ICU discharge, with maximum AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI 0.77-0.80) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.77-0.80), respectively. Models based on combined EEG and fMRI features predicted consciousness levels at study enrolment and ICU discharge with maximum AUCs of 0.78 (95% CI 0.71-0.86) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.89), respectively, with improved positive predictive value and sensitivity. Overall, both machine-learning algorithms (SVM and Random Forest) performed equally well. In conclusion, we suggest that acute DoC prediction models in the ICU be based on a combination of fMRI and EEG features, regardless of the machine-learning algorithm used.© The Author(s) 2022.

A substantial proportion of nonagenarians shows an unfavorable clinical outcome and high mortality, despite acceptable recanalization rates. A high prestroke disability (mRS) and advancing age predict an unfavorable outcome.

ETV treated patients (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.13-1.68) showed higher biochemical response rates compared with TAF- or TDF-treated patients after adjusting for similar parameters.In real-world practice, ETV was preferable for older, hepatitis B e-antigen negative patients with underlying comorbidities. Biochemical responses in patients treated with ETV, TAF, and TDF were significantly affected by metabolic factors such as fatty liver, obesity, and DM. However, the mechanism behind the higher biochemical response rate in patients treated with ETV should be investigated further.© 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We aim to test the relationships between various lipid parameters and target organ damage (TOD) including aortic stiffness, peripheral arterial disease and chronic kidney disease in a community-based elderly cohort.1599 (aged 71.4 ± 6.1 years) participants were recruited. Eight lipid parameters, including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL ratio, TG/HDL ratio and LDL/HDL ratio, together with other plasma biomarkers like creatinine were measured.

Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method, variables strongly associated with LPF were identified. Logistic regression was used to develop models to predict grade and stage of LPF. The grade model was validated using an independent data set.Of 284 patients in the discovery data set, median age (quartiles) was 16 (8-31) years, 68.7% were male patients, and 93.4% were White. Age of the patient, basal zone hyperplasia, dyskeratotic epithelial cells, and surface epithelial alteration were associated with presence of LPF. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the grade model was 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.89) and for stage model was 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.74-0.84). Our grade model had 82% accuracy in predicting the presence of LPF in an external validation data set.We developed parsimonious models (grade and stage) to predict presence of LPF in esophageal biopsies with inadequate lamina propria and validated our grade model. Our predictive models can be easily used in the clinical setting to include LPF in clinical decisions and determine its effect on treatment outcomes.Copyright © 2021 by The American College of Gastroenterology.",K12 HD087023|NICHD NIH HHS|United States|P30 DK058404|NIDDK NIH HHS|United States|U54 AI117804|NIAID NIH HHS|United States,22/12/2021,D016428;D016448;D064888;D052061;D013485;D023361,10.14309/ajg.0000000000001587,NA,1,1,,

Live-born singleton, nonanomalous newborns born at 23 to 41 weeks of gestation were included. Those with missing gestational age estimation or without a first- or second-trimester ultrasound to confirm dating, birthweight, or neonatal outcome data were excluded. Birthweight percentile was computed using an intrauterine standard (Hadlock) and a birthweight-derived standard (Olsen). We compared the test characteristics of small for gestational age (birthweight of <10th percentile) by each standard to predict a composite neonatal morbidity and mortality outcome (death before discharge, neonatal intensive care unit admission >48 hours, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, or seizures). Severe composite morbidity was analyzed as a secondary outcome and was defined as death, neonatal intensive care unit admission >7 days, necrotizing enterocolitis, grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, or seizures. The areas under the curve using receiver-operating characteristic methodology and proportions of the primary outcome by small for gestational age status were compared by gestational age category at birth (<34, 34 0/7 to 36 6/7, ≥37 weeks).Of 115,502 mother-newborn dyads in the parent study, 78,203 (67.7%) were included, with most exclusions occurring because of missing or inadequate dating information, multiple gestations, or delivery outside the gestational age range. The primary composite outcome occurred in 9.5% (95% confidence interval, 9.3-9.7), and the severe composite outcome occurred in 5.3% (95% confidence interval, 5.1-5.4). Small for gestational age was diagnosed by intrauterine and birthweight-derived standards in 14.8% and 7.4%, respectively (P<.001). Neonates considered small for gestational age only by the intrauterine standard experienced the primary outcome more than twice as often as those considered non-small for gestational age by both standards (18.4% vs 7.9%; P<.001). For the prediction of the primary outcome, small for gestational age by the intrauterine standard had higher sensitivity (29% vs 15%; P<.001) but lower specificity (87% vs 93%; P<.001) than by the birthweight standard. Both standards had weak performance overall, although the intrauterine standard had a higher area under the curve (0.58 vs 0.53; P<.001). When subanalyzed by gestational age at birth, the difference in areas under the curve was only present among preterm deliveries 34 to 36 competed weeks. Neither standard demonstrated any discrimination for morbidity prediction among term births (area under the curve, 0.50 for both). When the prediction of severe morbidity was compared, the intrauterine still had better overall prediction than the birthweight standard (areas under the curve, 0.65 vs 0.57; P<.001), although this also varied by gestational age at birth.Among nonanomalous neonates, neither intrauterine nor birthweight-derived standards for small for gestational age accurately predicted neonatal morbidity and mortality, with no discriminatory ability at term. Small for gestational age intrauterine standards performed better than birthweight standards.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

A sensitive and reliable breath test has the potential to greatly facilitate diagnoses and therapeutic monitoring of lung cancer.To investigate whether the breath test is able to detect lung cancer using the highly sensitive high-pressure photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPPI-TOFMS).This diagnostic study was conducted with a prospective-specimen collection, retrospective-blinded evaluation design. Exhaled breath samples were collected before surgery and detected by HPPI-TOFMS. The detection model was constructed by support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Patients with pathologically confirmed lung cancer were recruited from Peking University People's Hospital, and healthy adults without pulmonary noncalcified nodules were recruited from Aerospace 731 Hospital. Data analysis was performed from August to October 2020.Breath testing and SVM algorithm.The detection performance of the breath test was measured by sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).Exhaled breath samples were from 139 patients with lung cancer and 289 healthy adults, and all breath samples were collected and tested. Of all participants, 228 (53.27%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 57.0 (11.4) years. After clinical outcomes were ascertained, all participants were randomly assigned into the discovery data set (381 participants) and the blinded validation data set (47 participants).

Both clinical and radiological independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified, and their effect size was determined by calculating adjusted odds ratios (aORs) using multivariate logistic regression. Survival was displayed using Kaplan-Meier curves.Data of n=1866 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients in the Swiss SOS database were available. In-hospital mortality was 20% (n=373). In n=197 patients (10.6%), active treatment was discontinued after hospital admission (no aneurysm occlusion attempted), and this cohort was excluded from analysis of the main statistical model. In the remaining n=1669 patients, the rate of in-hospital mortality was 13.9% (n=232). Strong independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were rebleeding (aOR, 7.69; 95% confidence interval, 3.00-19.71; P<0.001), cerebral infarction attributable to delayed cerebral ischemia (aOR, 3.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.94-6.89; P<0.001), intraventricular hemorrhage (aOR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-5.09; P=0.003), and new infarction post-treatment (aOR, 2.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.43-4.62; P=0.002).Several-and among them modifiable-factors seem to be associated with in-hospital mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

However, no methods are practically available for measuring lymphedema-induced fibrosis before its deterioration. Technically, CT can visualize fibrosis in superficial and deep locations. For standardized measurement, verification of deep learning (DL)-based recognition was performed. A cross-sectional, observational cohort trial was conducted. After narrowing window width of the absorptive values in CT images, SegNet-based semantic segmentation model of every pixel into 5 classes (air, skin, muscle/water, fat, and fibrosis) was trained (65%), validated (15%), and tested (20%). Then, 4 indices were formulated and compared with the standardized circumference difference ratio (SCDR) and bioelectrical impedance (BEI) results. In total, 2138 CT images of 27 chronic unilateral lymphedema patients were analyzed. Regarding fibrosis segmentation, the mean boundary F1 score and accuracy were 0.868 and 0.776, respectively. Among 19 subindices of the 4 indices, 73.7% were correlated with the BEI (partial correlation coefficient: 0.420-0.875), and 13.2% were correlated with the SCDR (0.406-0.460). The mean subindex of Index 2 [Formula: see text] presented the highest correlation. DL has potential applications in CT image-based lymphedema-induced fibrosis recognition.

BAS were obtained by bronchoaspiration after IMV initiation. Three hundred sixty-four proteins were quantified using proximity extension assay (PEA) technology. Random forest models were used to assess predictor importance.After adjusting for confounding factors, CST5, NADK, SRPK2 and TGF-α were differentially detected in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. In random forest models for COVID-19, CST5, DPP7, NADK, KYAT1 and TYMP showed the highest variable importance. In COVID-19 patients, reduced levels of ENTPD2 and PTN were observed in nonsurvivors of ICU stay, even after adjustment. AGR2, NQO2, IL-1α, OSM and TRAIL showed the strongest associations with in-ICU mortality and were used to construct a protein-based prediction model. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a clear separation in mortality risk between subgroups of PTN, ENTPD2 and the prediction model. Cox regression models supported these findings. In survivors, the levels of FCRL1, NTF4 and THOP1 in BAS samples obtained during the ICU stay correlated with lung function (i.e., DLCO levels) 3 months after hospital discharge. Similarly, Flt3L and THOP1 levels were correlated with radiological features (i.e., TSS). These proteins are expressed in immune and nonimmune lung cells. Poor host response to viral infectivity and an inappropriate reparative mechanism seem to be linked with the pathogenesis of the disease and fatal outcomes, respectively.BAS proteomics identified novel factors associated with the pathology of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS and its adverse outcomes.

This study decide to evaluate the value of the Upper Lip Bite Test (ULBT) and the Modified Mallampati Test (MMT) in predicting difficult intubation under direct laryngoscopy and find out the most intuitive and simple method to predict difficult intubation under direct laryngoscopy in apparently normal patients.This descriptive-analytical study was performed on 450 patients for elective surgery under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation. The ULBT and MMT grading were evaluated preoperatively and Cormack and Lehane's (CL) classification was recorded on the day of surgery during intubation under direct laryngoscopy. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), likelihood ratio (LR), Youden index and area under ROC curve of ULBT and MMT respectively and in combination were calculated and compared. And the consistency between the total scores of ULBT and MMT combined in different ways and CL grading was counted.Of the 450 patients, 69 (15.3%) were classified as difficult cases of direct laryngoscopy. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of ULBT were 81.33, 11.59, 93.96, 25.81, 85.44%; and those the corresponding values for MMT were 66.22, 62.32, 69.29, 26.88 and 91.03%. A combination of ULBT and MMT did not improve the sensitivity in the sample tested. The combined total scores of ULBT and MMT in both ways were less consistent with CL grading in predicting difficult intubation under direct laryngoscopy.Based on findings of current study, we conclude that ULBT and MMT for difficult intubation have only poor to moderate discriminative power when used alone. The combination of the two tests in fractional form is also not a good predictor of difficult intubation under direct laryngoscopy.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2100052987, Registered 07 November 2021, http://www.chictr.org.cn.© 2022.

The battery of speech tasks will serve several purposes, such as measuring various elements of executive control (eg, attention and short-term memory), as well as measures of voice quality. Participants will then remotely self-administer speech tasks and follow-up symptom scales over a 4-week period. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of remote collection of continuous narrative speech across a wide range of NPDs using self-administered speech tasks. Additionally, the study evaluates if acoustic and linguistic patterns can predict diagnostic group, as measured by the sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the binary classifiers distinguishing each diagnostic group from each other. Acoustic features analysed include mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients, formant frequencies, intensity and loudness, whereas text-based features such as number of words, noun and pronoun rate and idea density will also be used.The study received ethical approval from the Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales (REC reference: 21/PR/0070). Results will be disseminated through open access publication in academic journals, relevant conferences and other publicly accessible channels.

We aimed at investigating the performance of composite respiratory indexes as possible predictors of CPAP failure in ARF due to COVID-19.This was a multicenter, prospective, observational, and cohort study conducted in the respiratory units of three University hospitals in Milan and in a secondary care hospital in Codogno (Italy), on consecutive adult patients with ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia that underwent CPAP between March 2020 and March 2021. ETI transfer to the intensive care unit or death is defined CPAP failure. Predictors of CPAP failure were assessed before T0 and 1 hour after T1 CPAP initiation and included mROX index (ratio of PaO2/FiO2 to respiratory rate), alveolar-to-arterial (A-a) O2 gradient, and the HACOR (heart rate, acidosis, consciousness, oxygenation, and respiratory rate) score.Three hundred and fifty four patients (mean age 64 years, 73% males) were included in the study; 136 (38.4%) satisfied criteria for CPAP failure. A-a O2 gradient, mROX, and HACOR scores were worse in patients who failed CPAP, both at T0 and T1 (p < 0.001 for all parameters). The HACOR score was associated with CPAP failure (odds ratio-OR-for every unit increase in HACOR = 1.361; 95%CI: 1.103-1.680; p=0.004; AUROC = 0.742; p < 0.001). CPAP failure was best predicted by a threshold of 4.50 (sensitivity = 53% and specificity = 87%).The HACOR score may be a reliable and early predictor of CPAP failure in patients treated for ARF in COVID-19 pneumonia.Copyright © 2022 Pierachille Santus et al.",NA,26/01/2022,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1155/2022/1499690,NA,1,1,,

We therefore further explored the diagnostic performance variation of this strategy using different risk prediction models.A literature search was conducted to identify studies evaluating risk models for advanced colorectal neoplasm (ACN). The included models were retrospectively validated in a subset sample (N = 3219) from a population-based CRC screening trial in China. Diagnosis-related indictors were compared between the risk-adapted screening strategy using different models and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-only strategy. For simulated populations with ACN prevalence of 3% to 12%, the trade-off of additional false positives for each additional true positive were calculated.We included 14 eligible risk models with the area under the curves ranging 0.570 to 0.652 in the validation set. The overall sensitivities of the risk-adapted screening strategy using different risk models for ACN varied from 46.0% to 69.8%, higher than FIT (21.9%), but at the expense of specificities (51.6% to 78.3% vs 97.1%). For population having ACN prevalence of 3%, risk-adapted screening strategies needed 20.5 to 31.1 additional false positives for each additional true positive compared with FIT, and respective number would substantially reduce (4.7 to 7.1) as the ACN prevalence increased to 12%.Risk-adapted screening strategy using the current risk models showed improved sensitivity for ACN compared with FIT, at the cost of increased colonoscopy workload. The optimal strategy for screening practice should be tailored considering the disease burden and availability of healthcare resources.© 2022 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",7202169|Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality||Z191100001119065|Beijing Nova Program of Science and Technology||82173606|National Natural Science Foundation of China|,10/03/2022,D016428,10.1111/jgh.15825,NA,1,1,,

Surgical treatment options targeted at the obstructing prostate are often required to relief the bladder outlet obstruction, following failure or discontinuation of medical therapies. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been the mainstay and gold standard for benign prostate surgery for last few decades. Currently with technological advancements, numerous minimally invasive surgical therapies have been employed to provide effective symptom relief while minimalizing morbidities and preserving sexual function. Prostatic hydroablation (Aquablation) is a new technique which involves high velocity water jets used in non-thermal ablation of the obstructing prostatic tissue robotically delivered by a transurethral cystoscopic handpiece and guided by real time transrectal ultrasound imaging. Recent trials have shown that aquablation is safe and effective in the treatment of symptomatic BPH while maintaining sexual preservation.Aquablation using the Aquabeam system (PROCEPT BioRobotics, Redwood Shores, CA, USA) combines the precision of autonomous robotic execution in delivering high velocity waterjets via a cystoscopic handpiece with accurate anatomical prostatic mapping using real time transrectal ultrasound imaging. The initial part of the surgery involves careful treatment planning tailored to the prostatic anatomy with preservation of important landmarks nearby, then, high velocity waterjet streams are delivered to ablate the obstructing prostatic tissue without use of any heat. Following the ablation and removal of handpiece, a routine cystoscopic bladder washout is performed and haemostasis achieved with balloon tamponade from a 3 way catheter placed under tension empolying a custom designed catheter tensioning device.Initial studies involving a few case series and a phase II trial demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of aquablation in treatment of symptomatic BPH. Subsequently, a large multicentre international prospective randomised blinded clinical trial (WATER) was conducted to assess the efficacy of aquablation versus TURP. Results from this pivotal trial showed non-inferior symptom relief compared to transurethral prostate resection but with a lower risk of sexual dysfunction. WATER II study was then conducted to assess the safety and feasibility from a multicentre prospective study of aquablation in the treatment of symptomatic large-volume BPH. The results from this study showed that aquablation is feasible and safe in treating men with men with large prostates (80-150 mL).The current landscape of BPH surgical treatment should be individualized with a shared decision- making process based on prostatic anatomy and clinical parameters combined with patient's preferences to select the ideal treatment option for each patient. Aquablation is one such option that involves a robotically delivered hydroablation technique based on individualised real time ultrasonic prostatic mapping that can offer safe and effective treatment for symptomatic BPH while minimising sexual dysfunction. Larger trials with longer follow up data will be required to further validate the long term effectiveness of aquablation.",NA,4/10/2019,D016428,NA,NA,0,0,,

In this multicenter observational study, MMSE and MoCA were administered in a random order to 130 patients: 35 MSA, 30 PSP and 65 age, and education and gender matched-PD. We assessed between-group differences for MMSE, MoCA, and their subitems. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. The mean MMSE was higher than the mean MoCA score in each MSA (27.7 ± 2.4 vs. 22.9 ± 3.0, p < 0.0001), PSP (26.0 ± 2.9 vs. 18.2 ± 3.9, p < 0.0001), and PD (27.3 ± 2.0 vs. 22.3 ± 3.5, p < 0.0001). MoCA total score as well as its letter fluency subitem differentiated PSP from MSA and PD with high specificity and moderate sensitivity. More specifically, a cut-off score of 7 F-words or less per minute would support a diagnosis of PSP (PSP vs. PD: 86 % specificity, 70 % sensitivity; PSP vs. MSA: 71 % specificity, 70 % sensitivity). By contrast, MMSE presented an overall ceiling effect for most subitems, except for the pentagon scores, where PSP did less well than MSA or PD patients. These preliminary results suggest that PSP and MSA, similar to PD patients, may present normal MMSE and reduced MoCA performance. Overall, MoCA is more sensitive than MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment in atypical parkinsonism and together with verbal fluency would be a useful test to support PSP diagnosis.",NA,24/06/2016,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1007/s00702-016-1589-3,NA,0,0,,

Our study aimed to train a clinically applicable DLS for fundus diseases using data derived from the real world, and externally test the model using fundus photographs collected prospectively from the settings in which the model would most likely be adopted.In this national real-world evidence study, we trained a DLS, the Comprehensive AI Retinal Expert (CARE) system, to identify the 14 most common retinal abnormalities using 207 228 colour fundus photographs derived from 16 clinical settings with different disease distributions. CARE was internally validated using 21 867 photographs and externally tested using 18 136 photographs prospectively collected from 35 real-world settings across China where CARE might be adopted, including eight tertiary hospitals, six community hospitals, and 21 physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was further compared with that of 16 ophthalmologists and tested using datasets with non-Chinese ethnicities and previously unused camera types. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04213430, and is currently closed.The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the internal validation set was 0·955 (SD 0·046). AUC values in the external test set were 0·965 (0·035) in tertiary hospitals, 0·983 (0·031) in community hospitals, and 0·953 (0·042) in physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was similar to that of ophthalmologists. Large variations in sensitivity were observed among the ophthalmologists in different regions and with varying experience. The system retained strong identification performance when tested using the non-Chinese dataset (AUC 0·960, 95% CI 0·957-0·964 in referable diabetic retinopathy).Our DLS (CARE) showed satisfactory performance for screening multiple retinal abnormalities in real-world settings using prospectively collected fundus photographs, and so could allow the system to be implemented and adopted for clinical care.This study was funded by the National Key R&D Programme of China, the Science and Technology Planning Projects of Guangdong Province, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.For the Chinese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

In total, 2000/12 653 (16%) of callers did not receive an emergency response and they had a 70/2000 (3.5%) risk of death or organ support. Ambulances were dispatched to 4230 callers (33.4%) who were not conveyed to hospital and did not deteriorate. Multivariable modelling found variables of older age (1 year increase, OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.05) and presence of pre-existing respiratory disease (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.60) to be predictors of false positive triage.Telephone triage can reduce ambulance responses but, with low specificity. A small but significant proportion of patients who do not receive an initial emergency response deteriorated. Research to improve accuracy of EMS telephone triage is needed and, due to limitations of routinely collected data, this is likely to require prospective data collection.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Soft drusen are the most extensively documented intraocular risk factor for progression to advanced AMD. A long-standing paradox in AMD pathophysiology has been the vulnerability of Asian populations to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in the presence of relatively few drusen. Age-related scattered hypofluorescent spots on late phase indocyanine green angiography (ASHS-LIA) was recently proposed as precursors of PCV. Herein, we offer a resolution to the paradox by reviewing evidence that ASHS-LIA indicates the diffuse form of lipoprotein-related lipids accumulating in Bruch's membrane (BrM) throughout adulthood. Deposition of these lipids leads to soft drusen and basal linear deposit (BLinD), a thin layer of soft drusen material in AMD; Pre-BLinD is the precursor. This evidence includes: 1. Both ASHS-LIA and pre-BLinD/BLinD accumulate in older adults and start under the macula; 2. ASHS-LIA shares hypofluorescence with soft drusen, known to be physically continuous with pre-BLinD/BLinD. 3. Model system studies illuminated a mechanism for indocyanine green uptake by retinal pigment epithelium. 4. Neither ASHS-LIA nor pre-BLinD/ BLinD are visible by multimodal imaging anchored on current optical coherence tomography, as confirmed with direct clinicopathologic correlation. To contextualize ASHS-LIA, we also summarize angiographic characteristics of different drusen subtypes in AMD. As possible precursors for PCV, lipid accumulation in forms beyond soft drusen may contribute to the pathogenesis of this prevalent disease in Asia. ASHS-LIA also might help identify patients at risk for progression, of value to clinical trials for therapies targeting early or intermediate AMD.© 2022.

Most patients with symptomatic LSS initially receive non-operative care before surgical consultation. However, there is a scarcity of data regarding prognosis for patients seeking non-surgical care. The overall goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a clinically useful model to predict long-term physical function of patients initiating non-surgical care for symptomatic LSS.This is a protocol for an inception cohort study of adults 50 years and older who are initiating non-surgical care for symptomatic LSS in a secondary care setting. We plan to recruit up to 625 patients at two study sites. We exclude patients with prior lumbar spine surgeries or those who are planning on lumbar spine surgery. We also exclude patients with serious medical conditions that have back pain as a symptom or limit walking. We are using weekly, automated data pulls from the electronic health records to identify potential participants. We then contact patients by email and telephone within 21 days of a new visit to determine eligibility, obtain consent, and enroll participants. We collect data using telephone interviews, web-based surveys, and queries of electronic health records. Participants are followed for 12 months, with surveys completed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome measure is the 8-item PROMIS Physical Function (PF) Short Form. We will identify distinct phenotypes using PROMIS PF scores at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months using group-based trajectory modeling. We will develop and evaluate the performance of a multivariable prognostic model to predict 12-month physical function using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and will compare performance to other machine learning methods. Internal validation will be conducted using k-folds cross-validation.This study will be one of the largest cohorts of individuals with symptomatic LSS initiating new episodes of non-surgical care. The successful completion of this project will produce a cross-validated prognostic model for LSS that can be used to tailor treatment approaches for patient care and clinical trials.© 2022.

Proptosis improved from 23.2 ± 2.1 to 20.6 ± 2.0 mm at 6 months (mean change: -2.9 ± 1.4 mm; p < .0001). Diplopia resolved in 7 patients. Thyroid receptor antibodies decreased markedly during TCZ treatment. Baseline serum IL-6 levels did not predict clinical response. TCZ was well-tolerated. During follow-up, 3 patients were diagnosed with cancer (breast cancer in 2 and urothelial cancer in 1).TCZ was rapidly effective and well-tolerated in our patients with GC-refractory GO. Four patients experienced mild/moderate adverse events as neutropenia, hyperlipidemia, and infections; nearly a third developed cancer during the follow-up. The increased incidence observed could be explained by the high prevalence of smokers, that are at higher risk for Graves' orbitopathy and solid malignancies as breast cancer. Thus, regular cancer screening could be proposed to this vulnerable population receiving high doses of immunosuppressants.© 2021 The Authors.

In the context of the EPIGRAM study (a French prospective, multisite, longitudinal observational study implementing integrative care practices (ICPs) for children with ASD), we aimed to assess the impact of migration on children with ASD.89 children with ASD aged 3 to 6 years old (92% males) were recruited and followed up for 12 months. The children were clinically assessed using several instruments. At baseline, children had severe autism on average on the Children Autism Rating Scale (CARS, mean = 44; SD = 6.51) and moderate autism on the PsychoEducational profile-3-R (PEP-3-R) maladaptive behavior category (mean = 30; SD = 29.89). Thirty percent of the families had a low socio-economic status, and 56% were first-generation immigrants. For all clinical variables, children of immigrant parents had more severe autism and developmental delays at baseline. A linear mixed model established an improvement in all clinical characteristics over the 12 months of the study. This trend may be attributed to ICPs or any naturally occurring event during that period. Families shared this positive view over time. However, the improvements were slower for two clinical dimensions of the PEP-3-R in children from migrant families. For the inappropriate behavior category, the time effect diminished by an average of 0.83 percentile/month for children whose parents were migrants vs. children whose parents were non-migrants. Similarly, for verbal behavior characteristics, the time effect diminished by an average of 1.32 percentile/month for children whose parents were migrants vs. children whose parents were non-migrants.Despite an overall positive improvement, we found that migration is associated baseline severity and progress over time in children with ASD.

The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether supervised telerehabilitation is superior to home exercise program regarding walking distance and secondarily muscle strength, muscle endurance, quality of life, physical activity level and perceived respiratory disability.This is a randomized assessor blinded control trial with two groups; tele-rehabilitation and home exercise. One hundred twenty-two COVID-19 survivors following discharge from intensive care unit will be allocated into two groups. The tele-rehabilitation group will receive breathing, aerobic, posture, stretching, strengthening exercises at their home under remote supervision via Internet for 3 days/week for 10 weeks. Home exercise group will receive the same program at their home on their own and they will be called weekly. The patients will be evaluated at the beginning, at the end of the program, 6th and 12th  months following the rehabilitation. The primary outcome is the change in 6-minute walking distance; the secondary outcomes are changes in quality of life, physical function, health status, dyspnea and muscle strength.This detailed description of the rehabilitation protocol will guide to plan the rehabilitation program and help how to design an efficacy study comparing different models of rehabilitation in COVID-19 survivors following discharge from intensive care unit with evidence-based contribution to the literature.© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",NA,9/07/2021,D000078325;D016428,10.1002/pri.1920,NA,1,1,,

Data is presented on prolonged M50 latencies in ASD as well as extension to include children with ASD with significant language and cognitive impairments in whom M50 latency delays are exacerbated. Modeling of the M50 latency by consideration of the properties of auditory pathway white matter is shown to be successful in typical development but challenged by heterogeneity in ASD; this, however, is capitalized upon to identify a distinct subpopulation of children with ASD whose M50 latencies lie well outside the range of values predictable from the typically developing model. Interestingly, this subpopulation is characterized by low levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Following from this, we discuss a potential use of the M50 latency in indicating ""target engagement"" acutely with administration of a GABA-B agonist, potentially distinguishing ""responders"" from ""non-responders"" with the implication of optimizing inclusion for clinical trials of such agents. Implications for future application, including potential evaluation of infants with genetic risk factors, are discussed. As such, the broad scope of potential of a representative candidate biological marker, the M50 latency, is introduced along with potential future applications.This paper outlines a strategy for understanding brain dysfunction in individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). It is proposed that a multimodal approach (collection of brain structure, chemistry, and neuronal functional data) will identify IDD subpopulations who share a common disease pathway, and thus identify individuals with IDD who might ultimately benefit from specific treatments. After briefly demonstrating the need and potential for scope, examples from studies examining brain function and structure in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) illustrate how measures of brain neuronal function (from magnetoencephalography, MEG), brain structure (from magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, especially diffusion MRI), and brain chemistry (MR spectroscopy) can help us better understand the heterogeneity in ASD and form the basis of multivariate biological markers (biomarkers) useable to define clinical subpopulations. Similar approaches can be applied to understand brain dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) in general. In large part, this paper represents our endeavors as part of the CHOP/Penn NICHD-funded intellectual and developmental disabilities research center (IDDRC) over the past decade.© 2021.

Majority of the physicians use sepsis as a prototype to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 as there are similarities. Heat-killed Mycobacterium w (Mw) (Inj. Mw®) is a known immunomodulator, which is approved for the treatment of gram-negative sepsis. This observational study was aimed to evaluate the role of Mw along with standard of care (SOC) in critically ill COVID-19 patients.Total 448 patients' data (intervention group: 298 in Mw plus SOC vs 150 in SOC alone) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed critically ill COVID-19 patients who were admitted at five tertiary care centers were evaluated. They were observed for changes in laboratory [C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] parameters, hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and discharge status after giving 0.3 mL intradermal Mw for 3 consecutive days along with SOC during hospitalization. Standard of care included injectable steroids, remdesivir, and heparin. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.2 (StataCorp., College Station, Texas, USA).In baseline characteristics, Mw plus SOC arm had more critically ill patients as seen by higher high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) score, higher lab values [CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, LDH, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)], and more oxygen requirement as compared to SOC alone. Mycobacterium w arm had significantly higher mortality rate in ICU and hospital. Both hospital stay and ICU stay were longer in Mw arm. However, subgroup analysis found that early initiation of Mw (<3 days vs >3 days) was associated with significantly lesser odds of mortality and lesser odds of intubation requirement. Early initiation of Mw (<3 days vs >3 days) also resulted in significantly lesser duration of stay in the ICU along with reduction of CRP, D-dimer, and LDH. Moreover, further analysis of early initiation of Mw (<3 days vs control) resulted in significant reduction in lab values (procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer).Mw when added to SOC was found to associate with significantly increased risk of mortality and increased length of hospital stay. However, time since admission to administration of Mw was a significant predictor of in-ICU deaths in multivariate analysis. Early initiation of Mw (<3 days) was observed to be a protective factor against ICU deaths from the multivariate logistic regression model. However, large randomized controlled trials are required to support the same.© Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.",NA,15/07/2022,D016428;D064888,10.5005/japi-11001-0044,NA,1,1,,

However, to the best of our knowledge, no study investigated the SII combined with PNI score to predict the efficacy of anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody sintilimab and XELOX regimen (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) in the treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer. This study aims to evaluate the predictive value of pre-treatment SII-PNI score on the sensitivity of sintilimab immunotherapy combined with XELOX chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer.We registered a prospective clinical study involving 30 locally advanced gastric cancer patients from March 2020 to July 2021. The pre-treatment SII and PNI were calculated from peripheral blood samples, and the cut-off value was calculated by receiver operating characteristic. The SII-PNI score ranged from 0 to 2 and were categorized into the following: score of 2, high SII (≥ 568.5) and low PNI (≤ 52.7); score of 1, either high SII or low PNI; score of 0, no high SII nor low PNI.All patients were evaluated by RECIST1.1 criteria after four cycles of sintilimab immunotherapy combined with XELOX chemotherapy, including 5 patients with TRG 3 and 25 patients with non-TRG 3. The SII-PNI score of non-TRG 3 patients was significantly lower than that of TRG 3 patients (P = 0.017). The medial progression free survival of patients with low SII-PNI score was significantly better than that of patients with high SII-PNI score (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that SII-PNI score was an independent prognostic factor for predicting progression-free survival (P = 0.003).The pre-treatment SII-PNI score is a significant indicator for predicting chemosensitivity of locally advanced patients after sintilimab immunotherapy combined with XELOX chemotherapy, which can help to identify high-risk groups and predict prognosis.The registered name of the trial is ""Prospective clinical study of sintilimab combined with chemotherapy for neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced gastric cancer"".

While current performance status evaluation tools are limited to their subjective nature, the advent of wearable technology enables continual recordings of patients' activity and has the potential to measure performance status objectively. We hypothesize that wristband actigraphy monitoring devices can predict in-hospital death of end-stage cancer patients during the time of their hospital admissions. The objective of this study was to train and validate a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep-learning prediction model based on activity data of wearable actigraphy devices. The study recruited 60 end-stage cancer patients in a hospice care unit, with 28 deaths and 32 discharged in stable condition at the end of their hospital stay. The standard Karnofsky Performance Status score had an overall prognostic accuracy of 0.83. The LSTM prediction model based on patients' continual actigraphy monitoring had an overall prognostic accuracy of 0.83. Furthermore, the model performance improved with longer input data length up to 48 h. In conclusion, our research suggests the potential feasibility of wristband actigraphy to predict end-of-life admission outcomes in palliative care for end-stage cancer patients.

However, data on older patients in clinical trials are scarce.We performed a systematic review and pooled analysis of real-life studies to explore the efficacy and toxicity of ICIs in unselected older individuals in multiple tumor settings treated outside of clinical trials.We searched articles, including prospective cohort studies, observational or retrospective series, or expanded access programs, published in English from 2010 to October 2020 in PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. We excluded hematological malignancies.Forty-eight studies met the predefined criteria and were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. We included 5524 patients.

Complete baseline, operative, and postoperative data were available for patients who underwent isolated CABG.Isolated CABG.The E-CABG complication classification was used to stratify the severity and prognostic impact of adverse postoperative events. Primary outcome endpoints were 30-day, 90-day, and long-term all-cause mortality. The secondary outcome endpoints was the length of intensive care unit stay. Both the E-CABG complication grades and additive score were predictive of 30-day (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 0.866, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.829-0.903; and 0.876; 95% CI 0.844-0.908, respectively) and 90-day (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 0.850, 95% CI 0.812-0.887; and 0.863, 95% CI 0.829-0.897, respectively) all-cause mortality.

When patients who died within 30 days were excluded from the analysis, this grading method still was associated with late mortality (p<0.0001). The grading method (p<0.0001) and the additive score (rho, 0.514; p<0.0001) were predictive of the length of intensive care unit stay.The E-CABG postoperative complication classification seems to be a promising tool for stratifying the severity and prognostic impact of postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The relationship between biomarkers and the risk of all-cause death or heart failure-related hospital admission (DHFA) was assessed. A tree-based pipeline optimizer platform was used to generate a multimarker predictive model for DHFA. We validated the model in an independent cohort of HFpEF patients enrolled in the PHFS (Penn Heart Failure Study) (n = 156).Two large, tightly related dominant biomarker clusters were found, which included biomarkers of fibrosis/tissue remodeling, inflammation, renal injury/dysfunction, and liver fibrosis. Other clusters were composed of neurohormonal regulators of mineral metabolism, intermediary metabolism, and biomarkers of myocardial injury. Multiple biomarkers predicted incident DHFA, including 2 biomarkers related to mineral metabolism/calcification (fibroblast growth factor-23 and OPG [osteoprotegerin]), 3 inflammatory biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, sTNFRI [soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor I], and interleukin-6), YKL-40 (related to liver injury and inflammation), 2 biomarkers related to intermediary metabolism and adipocyte biology (fatty acid binding protein-4 and growth differentiation factor-15), angiopoietin-2 (related to angiogenesis), matrix metalloproteinase-7 (related to extracellular matrix turnover), ST-2, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. A machine-learning-derived model using a combination of biomarkers was strongly predictive of the risk of DHFA (standardized hazard ratio: 2.85; 95% confidence interval: 2.03 to 4.02; p < 0.0001) and markedly improved the risk prediction when added to the MAGGIC (Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure Risk Score) risk score. In an independent cohort (PHFS), the model strongly predicted the risk of DHFA (standardized hazard ratio: 2.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.93 to 3.90; p < 0.0001), which was also independent of the MAGGIC risk score.Various novel circulating biomarkers in key pathophysiological domains are predictive of outcomes in HFpEF, and a multimarker approach coupled with machine-learning represents a promising strategy for enhancing risk stratification in HFpEF.Copyright © 2020 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Baseline EORTC QLU-C10D and EQ-5D-3L scores were used and index scores calculated for Italy, Australia, and the UK. Criterion validity was established by Spearman and intraclass correlations (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Construct validity was established by the instruments' ability to discriminate known groups, i.e. groups whose health status is expected to differ.We analyzed data from 619 MDS patients (61.1% male; median age 73.8 years). Correlations between theoretically corresponding domains were largely higher than between unrelated domains. ICCs and Bland-Altman plots indicated moderate to good criterion validity. Ceiling effects were lower for the QLU-C10D (4.7%) than for the EQ-5D-3L (22.6%).

Specifically, the prevalence and prognosis of ACLF in the context of AVB is unclear, while the role of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management in patients with ACLF has not been described to date.A multicenter, international, observational study was conducted in 2,138 patients from 34 centers between 2011 and 2015. ACLF was defined and graded according to the EASL-CLIF consortium definition. Placement of pre-emptive TIPS (pTIPS) was based on individual center policy. Patients were followed-up for 1 year, until death or liver transplantation. Cox regression and competing risk models (Gray's test) were used to identify independent predictors of rebleeding or mortality.At admission, 380/2,138 (17.8%) patients had ACLF according to EASL-CLIF criteria (grade 1: 38.7%; grade 2: 39.2%; grade 3: 22.1%). The 42-day rebleeding (19% vs. 10%; p <0.001) and mortality (47% vs. 10%; p <0.001) rates were higher in patients with ACLF and increased with ACLF grades. Of note, the presence of ACLF was independently associated with rebleeding and mortality. pTIPS placement improved survival in patients with ACLF at 42 days and 1 year. This effect was also observed in propensity score matching analysis of 66 patients with ACLF, of whom 44 received pTIPs and 22 did not.This large multicenter international real-life study identified ACLF at admission as an independent predictor of rebleeding and mortality in patients with AVB. Moreover, pTIPS was associated with improved survival in patients with ACLF and AVB.Acute variceal bleeding is a deadly complication of liver cirrhosis that results from severe portal hypertension. This study demonstrates that the presence of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is the strongest predictor of mortality in patients with acute variceal bleeding. Importantly, patients with ACLF and acute variceal (re)bleeding benefit from pre-emptive (early) placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.Copyright © 2020 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

SGA fetuses were classified according to maternal, fetal and placental conditions using a two-step cluster algorithm, in which fetuses with more than one condition were assigned to the cluster associated with the highest mortality risk. Delivery and perinatal outcomes were compared using chi-square test among SGA clusters, and the associations between outcomes and each cluster were evaluated by calculating odds ratios (OR), adjusted for gestational age.The study included 17 631 consecutive singleton pregnancies, of which 1274 (7.2%) were defined as SGA at birth according to INTERGROWTH-21st standards. Nine SGA clinical phenotypes were identified using a predefined conceptual framework. All delivery and perinatal outcomes analyzed were significantly different among the nine phenotypes. The whole SGA cohort had a three-times higher risk of perinatal mortality compared with non-SGA fetuses (1.4% vs 0.4%; P < 0.001). SGA clinical phenotypes exhibited three patterns of perinatal mortality risk: the highest risk was associated with congenital anomaly (8.3%; OR, 17.17 (95% CI, 2.17-136.12)) and second- or third-trimester hemorrhage (8.3%; OR, 9.94 (95% CI, 1.23-80.02)) clusters; medium risk was associated with gestational diabetes (3.8%; OR, 9.59 (95% CI, 1.27-72.57)), preterm birth (3.2%; OR, 4.65 (95% CI, 0.62-35.01)) and intrauterine growth restriction (3.1%; OR, 5.93 (95% CI, 3.21-10.95)) clusters; and the lowest risk was associated with the remaining clusters. Perinatal mortality rate did not differ between SGA fetuses without other clinical conditions (54.1% of SGA fetuses) and appropriate-for-gestational-age fetuses (0.1% vs 0.4%; OR, 0.41 (95% CI, 0.06-2.94); P = 0.27). SGA combined with other obstetric pathologies increased significantly the risk of perinatal mortality, as demonstrated by the increased odds of perinatal death in SGA cases with gestational diabetes compared to non-SGA cases with the same condition (OR, 24.40 (95% CI, 1.31-453.91)).We identified nine SGA clinical phenotypes associated with different patterns of risk for adverse perinatal outcome. Our findings suggest that considering clinical characteristics in addition to ultrasound findings could improve risk stratification and decision-making for management of SGA fetuses. Future clinical trials investigating management of fetuses with SGA should take into account clinical information in addition to Doppler parameters and estimated fetal weight. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.© 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.",NA,17/08/2021,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1002/uog.23765,NA,1,1,,

Geographic atrophy has no proven treatment or method for easy detection. Rapid, reliable, and objective detection and quantification of geographic atrophy from optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal scans is necessary for disease monitoring, prognostic research, and to serve as clinical endpoints for therapy development. To this end, we aimed to develop and validate a fully automated method to detect and quantify geographic atrophy from OCT.We did a deep-learning model development and external validation study on OCT retinal scans at Moorfields Eye Hospital Reading Centre and Clinical AI Hub (London, UK). A modified U-Net architecture was used to develop four distinct deep-learning models for segmentation of geographic atrophy and its constituent retinal features from OCT scans acquired with Heidelberg Spectralis. A manually segmented clinical dataset for model development comprised 5049 B-scans from 984 OCT volumes selected randomly from 399 eyes of 200 patients with geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration, enrolled in a prospective, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of geographic atrophy (FILLY study). Performance was externally validated on an independently recruited dataset from patients receiving routine care at Moorfields Eye Hospital (London, UK). The primary outcome was segmentation and classification agreement between deep-learning model geographic atrophy prediction and consensus of two independent expert graders on the external validation dataset.The external validation cohort included 884 B-scans from 192 OCT volumes taken from 192 eyes of 110 patients as part of real-life clinical care at Moorfields Eye Hospital between Jan 1, 2016, and Dec, 31, 2019 (mean age 78·3 years [SD 11·1], 58 [53%] women). The resultant geographic atrophy deep-learning model produced predictions similar to consensus human specialist grading on the external validation dataset (median Dice similarity coefficient [DSC] 0·96 [IQR 0·10]; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0·93) and outperformed agreement between human graders (DSC 0·80 [0·28]; ICC 0·79). Similarly, the three independent feature-specific deep-learning models could accurately segment each of the three constituent features of geographic atrophy: retinal pigment epithelium loss (median DSC 0·95 [IQR 0·15]), overlying photoreceptor degeneration (0·96 [0·12]), and hypertransmission (0·97 [0·07]) in the external validation dataset versus consensus grading.We present a fully developed and validated deep-learning composite model for segmentation of geographic atrophy and its subtypes that achieves performance at a similar level to manual specialist assessment. Fully automated analysis of retinal OCT from routine clinical practice could provide a promising horizon for diagnosis and prognosis in both research and real-life patient care, following further clinical validation FUNDING: Apellis Pharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Live-born singleton, nonanomalous newborns born at 23 to 41 weeks of gestation were included. Those with missing gestational age estimation or without a first- or second-trimester ultrasound to confirm dating, birthweight, or neonatal outcome data were excluded. Birthweight percentile was computed using an intrauterine standard (Hadlock) and a birthweight-derived standard (Olsen). We compared the test characteristics of small for gestational age (birthweight of <10th percentile) by each standard to predict a composite neonatal morbidity and mortality outcome (death before discharge, neonatal intensive care unit admission >48 hours, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, or seizures). Severe composite morbidity was analyzed as a secondary outcome and was defined as death, neonatal intensive care unit admission >7 days, necrotizing enterocolitis, grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, or seizures. The areas under the curve using receiver-operating characteristic methodology and proportions of the primary outcome by small for gestational age status were compared by gestational age category at birth (<34, 34 0/7 to 36 6/7, ≥37 weeks).Of 115,502 mother-newborn dyads in the parent study, 78,203 (67.7%) were included, with most exclusions occurring because of missing or inadequate dating information, multiple gestations, or delivery outside the gestational age range. The primary composite outcome occurred in 9.5% (95% confidence interval, 9.3-9.7), and the severe composite outcome occurred in 5.3% (95% confidence interval, 5.1-5.4). Small for gestational age was diagnosed by intrauterine and birthweight-derived standards in 14.8% and 7.4%, respectively (P<.001). Neonates considered small for gestational age only by the intrauterine standard experienced the primary outcome more than twice as often as those considered non-small for gestational age by both standards (18.4% vs 7.9%; P<.001). For the prediction of the primary outcome, small for gestational age by the intrauterine standard had higher sensitivity (29% vs 15%; P<.001) but lower specificity (87% vs 93%; P<.001) than by the birthweight standard. Both standards had weak performance overall, although the intrauterine standard had a higher area under the curve (0.58 vs 0.53; P<.001). When subanalyzed by gestational age at birth, the difference in areas under the curve was only present among preterm deliveries 34 to 36 competed weeks. Neither standard demonstrated any discrimination for morbidity prediction among term births (area under the curve, 0.50 for both). When the prediction of severe morbidity was compared, the intrauterine still had better overall prediction than the birthweight standard (areas under the curve, 0.65 vs 0.57; P<.001), although this also varied by gestational age at birth.Among nonanomalous neonates, neither intrauterine nor birthweight-derived standards for small for gestational age accurately predicted neonatal morbidity and mortality, with no discriminatory ability at term. Small for gestational age intrauterine standards performed better than birthweight standards.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Early identification and prediction of patients at risk of sepsis and adverse outcomes associated with sepsis are critical. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm that can predict sepsis early. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of an observational cohort study from the Intensive Care Unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. A total of 4,449 infected patients were randomly assigned to the development and validation data set at a ratio of 4:1. After extracting electronic medical record data, a set of 55 features (variables) was calculated and passed to the random forest algorithm to predict the onset of sepsis. Results: The pre-procedure clinical variables were used to build a prediction model from the training data set using the random forest machine learning method; a 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model. Finally, we tested the model using the validation data set. The area obtained by the model under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.91, the sensitivity was 87%, and the specificity was 89%. Conclusions: This newly established machine learning-based model has shown good predictive ability in Chinese sepsis patients. External validation studies are necessary to confirm the universality of our method in the population and treatment practice.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Li, Sun, Ding, Zhang, Liu, Han, Wang, Duan and Sun.",NA,2/11/2021,D016428;D064888;D016449;D013485,10.3389/fpubh.2021.754348,NA,1,1,,

Here, we report 3-year follow-up data.The eligibility criteria included clinical T3(SS)/T4a(SE) N1-3 M0 GC according to the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma-3rd English Edition (JCGC). Three cycles of neoadjuvant CapeOx (capecitabine, 2000mg/m2 for 14 days; oxaliplatin, 130mg/m2 on day 1, every 3 weeks) were administered, followed by 5 cycles of adjuvant CapeOx after D2 gastrectomy. Three-year overall survival and relapse-free survival are presented here, and analyzed by cohorts based on pathologic response rate (pRR).Thirty-seven pts were enrolled from July 2016 to May 2017, and fully evaluated for efficacy and toxicity. Thirty-three pts (89.2%) completed the planned three cycles of neoadjuvant CapeOx and underwent gastrectomy, with an R0 resection rate of 78.4% (n = 29). The overall survival (OS) rate and relapse-free survival (RFS) rate at 3 years was 83.8% (95% CI, 72.7-96.5%) and 73.0% (95% CI, 60.0-88.8%), respectively. Further, the 3-year OS rate in pts with pathological response of grade 1a (n = 13) and grade 1b or higher (n = 20) was 69.2% (95% CI: 48.2-99.5%) and 100.0%, respectively, based on JCGC. Pathological response rate was classified according to JCGC as follows: grade 0, the tumor was not affected; grade 1a, less than one-third of the tumor was affected; grade 1b, one to two thirds of the tumor was affected; grade 2, greater than or equal to two thirds was affected; and grade 3, no residual tumor. A pathological response was defined as grade 1b or greater.Perioperative CapeOx showed good feasibility and favorable prognosis, especially in pts with pathological response of grade 1b or higher and was found to be useful in predicting prognosis.

Dynamic prediction of tumour regression by NAC may allow for adaption of the treatment plan before completion, or even before the start of treatment. Such predictions may help prevent overtreatment and related toxicity and correct for undertreatment with ineffective regimens. Current imaging methods are not able to fully predict the efficacy of NAC. To successfully improve response prediction, tumour biology and heterogeneity as well as treatment-induced changes have to be considered. In the LIMA study, multiparametric MRI will be combined with liquid biopsies. In addition to conventional clinical and pathological information, these methods may give complementary information at multiple time points during treatment.To combine multiparametric MRI and liquid biopsies in patients with breast cancer to predict residual cancer burden (RCB) after NAC, in adjunct to standard clinico-pathological information. Predictions will be made before the start of NAC, approximately halfway during treatment and after completion of NAC.In this multicentre prospective observational study we aim to enrol 100 patients. Multiparametric MRI will be performed prior to NAC, approximately halfway and after completion of NAC.

Inter-rater agreement between investigators and patients regarding the reason for visit was low (κ coefficient: 0.338, p = 0.001). Inhaled treatment was modified in 88 patients at index, mainly due to symptomatic state (31.8%) and exacerbations (27.3%); treatment was escalated (57.9%, mainly switched to LABA+LAMA+ICS), inhaler device and/or active ingredient was changed (36.4%) or treatment was de-escalated (5.7%). 27% had ≥1 hospital overnight stay over 12 months. Emergency department visits and days with limitation of daily activities were higher in group D (p < 0.001).Despite being on-treatment, many patients with COPD experience persistent symptoms and exacerbations requiring hospital-related HRU. A treatable trait approach and holistic disease management may improve outcomes by deciding the right treatment for the right patient at the right time.© 2022 Gunen et al.",NA,26/08/2022,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.2147/COPD.S372439,NA,1,1,,

The detection and diagnosis of AF represent a major clinical challenge due to AF's asymptomatic and intermittent nature. Novel consumer-grade mobile health (mHealth) products with automatic arrhythmia detection could be an option for long-term electrocardiogram (ECG)-based rhythm monitoring and AF detection.We evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of a wearable automated mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system, including a consumer-grade, single-lead heart rate belt ECG device (heart belt), a mobile phone application, and a cloud service with an artificial intelligence (AI) arrhythmia detection algorithm for AF detection. The specific aim of this proof-of-concept study was to test the feasibility of the entire sequence of operations from ECG recording to AI arrhythmia analysis and ultimately to final AF detection.Patients (n=159) with an AF (n=73) or sinus rhythm (n=86) were recruited from the emergency department. A single-lead heart belt ECG was recorded for 24 hours. Simultaneously registered 3-lead ECGs (Holter) served as the gold standard for the final rhythm diagnostics and as a reference device in a user experience survey with patients over 65 years of age (high-risk group).The heart belt provided a high-quality ECG recording for visual interpretation resulting in 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AF detection. The accuracy of AF detection with the automatic AI arrhythmia detection from the heart belt ECG recording was also high (97.5%), and the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 95.4%, respectively. The correlation between the automatic estimated AF burden and the true AF burden from Holter recording was >0.99 with a mean burden error of 0.05 (SD 0.26) hours. The heart belt demonstrated good user experience and did not significantly interfere with the patient's daily activities. The patients preferred the heart belt over Holter ECG for rhythm monitoring (85/110, 77% heart belt vs 77/109, 71% Holter, P=.049).A consumer-grade, single-lead ECG heart belt provided good-quality ECG for rhythm diagnosis. The mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system, consisting of heart-belt ECG, a mobile phone application, and an automated AF detection achieved AF detection with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, the mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system showed good user experience.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03507335; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03507335.©Onni E Santala, Jari Halonen, Susanna Martikainen, Helena Jäntti, Tuomas T Rissanen, Mika P Tarvainen, Tomi P Laitinen, Tiina M Laitinen, Eemu-Samuli Väliaho, Juha E K Hartikainen, Tero J Martikainen, Jukka A Lipponen.

The main objective was to assess the long-term effect of ketamine on pain and health variables in patients with refractory chronic pain. A prospective, multicenter, 1-year follow-up observational study (NCT03319238) was conducted in 30 French pain clinics where ketamine is commonly prescribed. This study focused on patients with 1 ketamine delivery procedure (n = 256). The primary endpoint was pain intensity (0-10 numerical pain rating scale) before and after ketamine every month for 1 year. Secondary outcomes aimed to identify pain trajectories by semiparametric mixture models and to collect adverse events. The following data were obtained for 256 patients: Pain intensity decreased significantly (6.8 ± 1.8, n = 240 at baseline vs 5.7 ± 1.8, n = 93 at 12 months; P < 0.001). The effect size of the main endpoint was 0.61 (95% confidence interval: [0.40-0.80]; P < 0.001). Three pain trajectories were identified: 16.0% of patients in ""mild pain"" (mostly neuropathic pain), 35.3% in ""moderate pain,"" and 45.7% in ""severe pain"" (mostly fibromyalgia) trajectory. Neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia presented opposite outcomes, pain severity being associated with anxiety, depression, and a poorer quality of life. Adverse events occurred at 1 week in 108/218 [50%] patients, and this rate gradually decreased throughout the follow-up. This real-life study in chronic pain identified distinct pain trajectories and predictive variables of ketamine efficacy. It is now pivotal to further study and optimize the subtyping of patients to provide the most effective and safe ketamine treatment in this vulnerable population.Copyright © 2021 International Association for the Study of Pain.",NA,13/07/2021,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002403,NCT03319238,1,1,,

Quantitative image features were extracted from mp-MRI and WSI and used to construct a radiopathomics signature (RPS) powered by an artificial-intelligence model. Models based on mp-MRI or WSI alone were also constructed for comparison.The RPS showed overall accuracy of 79.66-87.66% in validation cohorts. The areas under the curve of RPS at specific response grades were 0.98 (TRG0), 0.93 (≤ TRG1), and 0.84 (≤ TRG2). RPS at each grade of pathological response revealed significant improvement compared with both signatures constructed without combining multiscale tumor information (P < 0.01). Moreover, RPS showed relevance to distinct probabilities of overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with LARC who underwent nCRT (P < 0.05).The results of this study suggest that radiopathomics, combining both radiological information of the whole tumor and pathological information of local lesions from biopsy, could potentially predict discrepancies of pathological response prior to nCRT for better treatment planning.",QYZDJ-SSW-JSC005|Chinese Academy of Sciences||KFJ-STS-ZDTP-059|Chinese Academy of Sciences||2019136|Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS||81922040|National Natural Science Foundation of China||81930053|National Natural Science Foundation of China||81527805|National Natural Science Foundation of China||81772012|National Natural Science Foundation of China||7182109|Beijing Natural Science Foundation||2017YFA0205200|National Key R&D Program of China||2017YFA0700401|National Key R&D Program of China||2016YFA0100902|National Key R&D Program of China||XDB32030200|Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences||XDB01030200|Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences|,31/07/2020,D016428;D016448,10.1245/s10434-020-08659-4,NA,0,0,,

It often leads to foot drop or equinus, interfering with walking. Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are commonly used in these cases. However, AFOs can be too restrictive for mildly impaired patients. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the ankle-dorsiflexors is an alternative treatment as it could function as a dynamic functional orthosis. Despite previous research, high level evidence on the effects of FES on activities and participation in daily life is missing. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether FES improves the activity and participation level in daily life according to patients, and the secondary aim is to provide evidence of the effect of FES at the level of body functions and activities. Furthermore, we aim to collect relevant information for decisions on its clinical implementation.A randomized crossover trial will be performed on 25 children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy. Patients aged between 4 and 18 years, with Gross Motor Functioning Classification System level I or II and unilateral foot drop of central origin, currently treated with AFO or adapted shoes, will be included. All participants will undergo twelve weeks of conventional treatment (AFO/adapted shoes) and 12 weeks of FES treatment, separated by a six-week washout-phase. FES treatment consists of wearing the WalkAide® device, with surface electrodes stimulating the peroneal nerve during swing phase of gait. For the primary objective, the Goal Attainment Scale is used to test whether FES improves activities and participation in daily life. The secondary objective is to prove whether FES is effective at the level of body functions and structures, and activities, including ankle kinematics and kinetics measured during 3D-gait analysis and questionnaire-based frequency of falling. The tertiary objective is to collect relevant information for clinical implementation, including acceptability using the device log file and side effect registration, cost-effectiveness based on quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and clinical characteristics for patient selection.We anticipate that the results of this study will allow evidence-based use of FES during walking in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy.ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT03440632 .© 2022.

After the surgery, a careful electrode programming strategy and medical management are crucial, because an imbalance between them can compromise the quality of life over time. Clinical management is not straightforward and depends on several perioperative motor and non-motor symptoms. In this study, we review the literature data on acute medical management after STN DBS in PD and propose a clinical algorithm on medical management focused on the patient's phenotypic profile at the perioperative period. Overall, across the trials, the levodopa equivalent daily dose is reduced by 30 to 50% one year after surgery. In patients taking high doses of dopaminergic drugs or with high risk of impulse control disorders, an initial reduction in dopamine agonists after STN DBS is recommended to avoid the hyperdopaminergic syndrome, particularly hypomania. On the other hand, a rapid reduction of dopaminergic agonists of more than 70% during the first months can lead to dopaminergic agonist withdrawal syndrome, characterized by apathy, pain, and autonomic features. In a subset of patients with severe dyskinesia before surgery, an initial reduction in levodopa seems to be a more reasonable approach. Finally, when the patient's phenotype before the surgery is the severe parkinsonism (wearing-off) with or without tremor, reduction of the medication after surgery can be more conservative. Individualized medical management following DBS contributes to the ultimate therapy success.",NA,16/04/2020,D016428;D016454,10.1590/0004-282X20190188,NA,0,0,,

We included patients aged ≥18 years with CAP who underwent abdominal ultrasonography. We compared between patients with and without NAFLD in term of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, CURB-65, pneumonia severity index (PSI), liver enzymes, C-reactive protein (CRP) and 30-day all-cause mortality. We used fibrosis score to distinguish between patients with NAFLD who have advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) and do not have (F0-F2).A total of 561 patients were included in this study.

The long-term risks of stroke, mortality and AF recurrence rate in patients with postoperative AF (POAF) are unclear.We performed a systematic literature review in electronic databases from inception to March 5th, 2020 of studies reporting the incidence of stroke, mortality and AF recurrence in patients with POAF. We confined our analysis to studies with a cohort of at least 150 patients with POAF and with a median follow-up of 12 months as a minimum. Odds Ratios (OR) were pooled using a random-effects model.Qualitative analysis included 8 studies (7 observational cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial) enrolling 3,718,587 patients. Six studies underwent metanalysis comprising 17,684 postoperative patients with POAF and 2,169,248 postoperative patients without POAF. The development of POAF conferred a four-fold increased risk of stroke in the long-term [OR 4.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.91-5.62]. Mortality in the two studies reporting long-term data was higher in patients with POAF compared to those without POAF (OR 3.59; CI 95% 2.84-4.53). Data about recurrence were too heterogeneous to undergo metanalysis.POAF is associated with a greater risk of stroke and mortality over the long-term period. Studies focusing on AF recurrence are needed to address the perception of POAF as a benign transient entity. The increased mortality risk following POAF should encourage systematic detection and prevention of this arrhythmia.Copyright © 2020.

However, most studies remain confined to in silico validation in small internal cohorts, without external validation or data on real-world clinical utility. We developed a strategy for the clinical validation of deep learning models for segmenting primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours and involved lymph nodes in CT images, which is a time-intensive step in radiation treatment planning, with large variability among experts.In this observational study, CT images and segmentations were collected from eight internal and external sources from the USA, the Netherlands, Canada, and China, with patients from the Maastro and Harvard-RT1 datasets used for model discovery (segmented by a single expert). Validation consisted of interobserver and intraobserver benchmarking, primary validation, functional validation, and end-user testing on the following datasets: multi-delineation, Harvard-RT1, Harvard-RT2, RTOG-0617, NSCLC-radiogenomics, Lung-PET-CT-Dx, RIDER, and thorax phantom. Primary validation consisted of stepwise testing on increasingly external datasets using measures of overlap including volumetric dice (VD) and surface dice (SD). Functional validation explored dosimetric effect, model failure modes, test-retest stability, and accuracy. End-user testing with eight experts assessed automated segmentations in a simulated clinical setting.We included 2208 patients imaged between 2001 and 2015, with 787 patients used for model discovery and 1421 for model validation, including 28 patients for end-user testing. Models showed an improvement over the interobserver benchmark (multi-delineation dataset; VD 0·91 [IQR 0·83-0·92], p=0·0062; SD 0·86 [0·71-0·91], p=0·0005), and were within the intraobserver benchmark. For primary validation, AI performance on internal Harvard-RT1 data (segmented by the same expert who segmented the discovery data) was VD 0·83 (IQR 0·76-0·88) and SD 0·79 (0·68-0·88), within the interobserver benchmark. Performance on internal Harvard-RT2 data segmented by other experts was VD 0·70 (0·56-0·80) and SD 0·50 (0·34-0·71). Performance on RTOG-0617 clinical trial data was VD 0·71 (0·60-0·81) and SD 0·47 (0·35-0·59), with similar results on diagnostic radiology datasets NSCLC-radiogenomics and Lung-PET-CT-Dx. Despite these geometric overlap results, models yielded target volumes with equivalent radiation dose coverage to those of experts. We also found non-significant differences between de novo expert and AI-assisted segmentations. AI assistance led to a 65% reduction in segmentation time (5·4 min; p<0·0001) and a 32% reduction in interobserver variability (SD; p=0·013).We present a clinical validation strategy for AI models. We found that in silico geometric segmentation metrics might not correlate with clinical utility of the models. Experts' segmentation style and preference might affect model performance.US National Institutes of Health and EU European Research Council.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Biomarker profiling emerges as a promising tool for the early diagnosis and risk stratification of either DM or CAD. However, studies assessing the predictive capacity of novel metabolomics biomarkers in coexistent CAD and DM are scarce.This post-hoc analysis of the CorLipid trial (NCT04580173) included 316 patients with CAD and comorbid DM who underwent emergency or elective coronary angiography due to acute or chronic coronary syndrome. Cox regression analyses were performed to identify metabolomic predictors of the primary outcome, which was defined as the composite of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding), repeat unplanned revascularizations and cardiovascular hospitalizations. Linear regression analyses were also performed to detect significant predictors of CAD complexity, as assessed by the SYNTAX score.After a median 2-year follow up period (IQR = 0.7 years), the primary outcome occurred in 69 (21.8%) of patients. Acylcarnitine ratio C4/C18:2, apolipoprotein (apo) B, history of heart failure (HF), age > 65 years and presence of acute coronary syndrome were independent predictors of the primary outcome in diabetic patients with CAD (aHR = 1.89 [1.09, 3.29]; 1.02 [1.01, 1.04]; 1.28 [1.01, 1.41]; 1.04 [1.01, 1.05]; and 1.12 [1.05-1.21], respectively). Higher levels of ceramide ratio C24:1/C24:0, acylcarnitine ratio C4/C18:2, age > 65 and peripheral artery disease were independent predictors of higher CAD complexity (adjusted β = 7.36 [5.74, 20.47]; 3.02 [0.09 to 6.06]; 3.02 [0.09, 6.06], respectively), while higher levels of apoA1 were independent predictors of lower complexity (adjusted β= - 0.65 [- 1.31, - 0.02]).In patients with comorbid DM and CAD, novel metabolomic biomarkers and metabolomics-based prediction models could be recruited to predict clinical outcomes and assess the complexity of CAD, thereby enabling the integration of personalized medicine into routine clinical practice. These associations should be interpreted taking into account the observational nature of this study, and thus, larger trials are needed to confirm its results and validate them in different and larger diabetic populations.© 2022.

It was derived from examining a dataset of 70,540 ICH patients between 2015 and 2018 from the Chinese Stroke Center Alliance (CSCA). During the training of ICH-LR2S2, patients were randomly divided into two groups - 80% for the training set and 20% for model validation. A prospective test set was developed using 12,523 patients recruited in 2019. To further verify its effectiveness, we tested ICH-LR2S2 on an external dataset of 24,860 patients from the China National Stroke Registration Management System II (CNSR II). The performance of ICH-LR2S2 was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).The incidence of SAP in the dataset was 25.52%. A 24-point ICH-LR2S2 was developed from independent predictors, including age, modified Rankin Scale, fasting blood glucose, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale admission score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, C-reactive protein, dysphagia, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and current smoking. The results showed that ICH-LR2S2 achieved an AUC = 0.749 [95% CI 0.739-0.759], which outperforms the best baseline ICH-APS (AUC = 0.704) [95% CI 0.694-0.714]. Compared with the previous ICH risk scores, ICH-LR2S2 incorporates fasting blood glucose and C-reactive protein, improving its discriminative ability. Machine learning methods such as XGboost (AUC = 0.772) [95% CI 0.762-0.782] can further improve our prediction performance. It also performed well when further validated by the external independent cohort of patients (n = 24,860), ICH-LR2S2 AUC = 0.784 [95% CI 0.774-0.794].ICH-LR2S2 accurately distinguishes SAP patients based on easily available clinical features. It can help identify high-risk patients in the early stages of diseases.© 2022. The Author(s).",NA,6/05/2022,D016428;D016449;D013485,10.1186/s12967-022-03389-5,NA,1,1,,

However, most studies remain confined to in silico validation in small internal cohorts, without external validation or data on real-world clinical utility. We developed a strategy for the clinical validation of deep learning models for segmenting primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours and involved lymph nodes in CT images, which is a time-intensive step in radiation treatment planning, with large variability among experts.In this observational study, CT images and segmentations were collected from eight internal and external sources from the USA, the Netherlands, Canada, and China, with patients from the Maastro and Harvard-RT1 datasets used for model discovery (segmented by a single expert). Validation consisted of interobserver and intraobserver benchmarking, primary validation, functional validation, and end-user testing on the following datasets: multi-delineation, Harvard-RT1, Harvard-RT2, RTOG-0617, NSCLC-radiogenomics, Lung-PET-CT-Dx, RIDER, and thorax phantom. Primary validation consisted of stepwise testing on increasingly external datasets using measures of overlap including volumetric dice (VD) and surface dice (SD). Functional validation explored dosimetric effect, model failure modes, test-retest stability, and accuracy. End-user testing with eight experts assessed automated segmentations in a simulated clinical setting.We included 2208 patients imaged between 2001 and 2015, with 787 patients used for model discovery and 1421 for model validation, including 28 patients for end-user testing. Models showed an improvement over the interobserver benchmark (multi-delineation dataset; VD 0·91 [IQR 0·83-0·92], p=0·0062; SD 0·86 [0·71-0·91], p=0·0005), and were within the intraobserver benchmark. For primary validation, AI performance on internal Harvard-RT1 data (segmented by the same expert who segmented the discovery data) was VD 0·83 (IQR 0·76-0·88) and SD 0·79 (0·68-0·88), within the interobserver benchmark. Performance on internal Harvard-RT2 data segmented by other experts was VD 0·70 (0·56-0·80) and SD 0·50 (0·34-0·71). Performance on RTOG-0617 clinical trial data was VD 0·71 (0·60-0·81) and SD 0·47 (0·35-0·59), with similar results on diagnostic radiology datasets NSCLC-radiogenomics and Lung-PET-CT-Dx. Despite these geometric overlap results, models yielded target volumes with equivalent radiation dose coverage to those of experts. We also found non-significant differences between de novo expert and AI-assisted segmentations. AI assistance led to a 65% reduction in segmentation time (5·4 min; p<0·0001) and a 32% reduction in interobserver variability (SD; p=0·013).We present a clinical validation strategy for AI models. We found that in silico geometric segmentation metrics might not correlate with clinical utility of the models. Experts' segmentation style and preference might affect model performance.US National Institutes of Health and EU European Research Council.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The findings of this study can inform the development of a family-oriented care model to support the pneumoconiosis patients and their family caregivers to manage this condition better.Pneumoconiosis is the most common type of occupational lung disease in the Chinese population. These patients require long-term comprehensive services and support to assist their disease self-management. However, little is known about how these patients and their family caregivers manage the disease in the family context. The current study addresses this gap by exploring patients' illness experience and their family members' caregiving experience, which is timely to inform the design of family-oriented model of care to support this clinical cohort.This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04022902).© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund Board|,3/10/2019,D000078325;D016428,10.1111/jan.14203,NCT04022902,1,0,,

A prognostic nutritional index, based on serum albumin levels and peripheral lymphocyte count, has been confirmed to be significantly associated with various cancers. This study was aimed at exploring the prognostic significance of PNI in the overall survival prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer. As a real-world study based on the big database, clinical data of 2661 patients with esophageal cancer were evaluated retrospectively, and the individuals were randomly divided into training and testing cohorts. In these two cohorts, patients are classified into a high-risk group (PNI < 49) and a low-risk group (PNI ≥ 49). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the independent risk factors for the prognosis of esophageal cancer patients by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. In this study, whether in the training cohort or the testing cohort, according to the univariate analysis, gender, tumor size, tumor grade, T stage, N stage, M stage, TNM stage, and PNI were significantly correlated with overall survival. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis showed that gender, T stage, N stage, M stage, TNM stage, and PNI were independent prognostic risk factors for esophageal cancer. PNI can be regarded as an independent prognostic factor combined with gender, T stage, N stage, M stage, and TNM stage, and it might be a novel reliable biomarker for esophageal cancer.Copyright © 2022 Juanjuan Kang et al.",NA,26/07/2022,D016428;D064888;D016449,10.1155/2022/3889588,NA,1,1,,

Insights from the real-world non-interventional BALANCE study on the present use of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel in advanced Parkinson's disease in Germany and Switzerland.,"Advanced Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor and non-motor fluctuations to oral dopamine replacement therapy. The BALANCE study evaluated the clinical practice in Germany and Switzerland, when patients eligible for levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) therapy decided to either switch to LCIG or to stay on optimized standard of care (SoC) oral therapy as a non-randomized regular clinical decision.In this non-interventional, multicenter, prospective observational study, patients were recruited between 2015 and 2020. We obtained comprehensive baseline characteristics in both groups. As primary endpoint, we evaluated whether LCIG led to higher quality-of-life (QoL) improvement than SoC after 12 months. As secondary endpoints, we studied several motor and non-motor outcomes.About half of the 137 patients decided for LCIG treatment (n = 73, 53.5%). Those were aged >70 years more often, had more advanced disease stage, higher burden of motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive impairment including dementia compared to SoC. QoL change after 12 months did not differ between groups (P = 0.286). The LCIG group improved in secondary outcomes, including the UPDRS III in ON, UPDRS IV, Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale, and Non-Motor Symptoms Scale. Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale improved in 78.0% and 19.5% of patients receiving LCIG and SoC, respectively. Caregiver burden remained stable in LCIG but worsened with SoC.In current practice, patients and physicians delayed LCIG treatment and started substantially beyond the established indication criteria. This practice bears the risk to produce inferior results compared to the results from existing high-level evidence.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines suggest that apoB can be an alternative to non-HDL-C or LDL-C in patients with high triglyceride levels, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or very low LDL-C levels. This study explores whether apoB can also serve as predictive value for long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in normal people and specific coronary atherosclerosis patients.A total of 826 patients were followed up over 10 years, and the risk factors for MACEs were retrospectively analyzed in patients with CHD and particular subpopulations. All statistical analyses were performed in R software. Cox regressions were performed to assess independent risk factors of long-term MACEs in the atherosclerosis group and CHD subgroups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to evaluate the survival rate for patients in different apoB quartiles, and receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to compare apoB and other lipids in predicting the presence of long-term MACE.apoB could be a ""risk-enhancing factor"" in patients with coronary atherosclerosis disease, whereas in the Normal population, LDL-C still acted as a major risk factor for predicting MACEs. apoB was a good risk predictor for long-term cardiovascular events in coronary atherosclerosis (AS) patients, including the AS group and CHD subpopulations (including CHD + triglyceride ≥2.3 mmol/L, CHD + diabetes mellitus, CHD + body mass index ≥25 kg/m2, or CHD + metabolic syndrome). In patients with CHD whose condition was complicated with diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, apoB performed better than other lipids in predicting the presence of myocardial infarction, hospitalization due to angina, and cardiac death. Despite achieving optimal LDL-C or non-HDL-C levels, patients with CHD are still at risk of worse survival if they are unable to reach a low apoB level (lower cut points such as 65 mg/dL).More attention should be paid to special populations with residual elevations of atherogenic particle numbers, and greater focus should be placed on lowering baseline apoB to achieve long-term benefits. However, given that this was an observational study, the association of baseline apoB level and long-term MACEs only was evaluated; it is unclear whether the emergence of MACEs would be influenced by the dynamic changes of apoB. Because this was a retrospective and observational analysis, bias in data analysis was unavoidable; thus, the results cannot be used to generalize implications to broader patient populations, and more large-scale clinical trials are required to verify these findings.

The only curative treatment for RPS has traditionally been complete macroscopic en bloc resection with adjacent structures that cannot be surgically separated from the tumor. Compartmental resection, incorporating adjacent organs and soft tissues en bloc, even without overt infiltration at the time of surgery, performed in sarcoma referral centers may reduce local recurrence rates. Preoperative radiotherapy has not been shown to reduce early 3-year local recurrences in a phase III, international, randomized, controlled trial (STRASS). Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether well-differentiated and low-grade dedifferentiated liposarcoma prone to late local recurrences may benefit. Currently, there is no level 1 evidence to support the use of perioperative systemic therapy. Observational studies suggest that patients with high-grade histologies and borderline resectable RPS may benefit. A phase III, international, randomized, controlled trial (STRASS2) is currently evaluating a histology-tailored chemotherapy regimen for patients with leiomyosarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma at high risk of distant metastatic recurrence. Novel biomarkers can help determine prognosis and more accurately predict response to treatment, but more research is needed to translate these discoveries into therapeutic benefits. Refined molecular data for histological types will allow personalized surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy with lower toxicity and improved survival in the future.© 2022.

The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality, and the secondary outcome measures were in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality. Statistical analyses included simple descriptive statistics, binary logistic regression analyses, and Kaplan-Meier survival statistics.A total of 523 octogenarians were eligible for inclusion. Emergency laparotomy in octogenarians was associated with 21.8% (95% CI 18.3-25.6%) 30-day postoperative mortality, 22.6% (95% CI 19.0-26.4%) in-hospital mortality, and 40.2% (95% CI 35.9-44.5%) 1-year mortality. Binary logistic regression analysis identified ASA status (OR, 2.49; 95% CI 1.82-3.38, P < 0.0001) and peritoneal contamination (OR, 2.00; 95% CI 1.30-3.08, P = 0.002) as predictors of 30-day postoperative mortality.

From the day of mifepristone intake, the strength of vaginal bleeding was recorded daily for 2 weeks by the patient herself using a diary sheet. Treatment success was defined as no histologically confirmed retained products of conception (RPOC) within 3 months. After considering all drop-out criteria, 154 women were included in the analysis.40.0% of patients (95% CI 30.4-49.6) already reported bleeding onset in the time period between the intake of mifepristone and misoprostol. The median duration of vaginal bleeding including spotting was 13 days. The chance of RPOC was about sixfold (OR 6.06, 95% CI 2.15-17.10) in the group of persistent bleeding after 2 weeks compared to the group with a terminated bleeding at that time. Exploratory regression analysis indicated association of higher serum levels of leukocytes at treatment start with RPOC (p = 0.013).Terminated bleeding after 2 weeks is a useful indicator for successful medical induction of EPL.

The purpose of this study was to determine the MCID of several PROMs (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Knee Society Score (KSS) and the SF-12) in patients who underwent medial opening-wedge High-Tibial Osteotomy (owHTO) with Patient-Specific Cutting Guides (PSCGs), using anchor-based methods.Patients undergoing isolated medial owHTO with PSCGs between January 2013 and January 2017 were enrolled in this single-center, prospective, observational study. Three outcome scores were collected pre-operatively and at the 2 years follow-up evaluation: KOOS, KSS and SF-12. The MCIDs were calculated using anchor-based method: at 2 years postoperatively: ""Compared with before surgery, how would you rate operated joint now?""

Clinical decision support (CDS) systems have the potential to aid in the identification and management of patients with FH. Prior studies using computer-based systems to screen patients for FH have shown promising results, but there has been no randomized controlled trial conducted. The aim of the current cluster randomized study is to evaluate if a CDS can increase the identification of FH.We have developed a CDS integrated in the electronic health records that will be activated in patients with elevated cholesterol levels (total cholesterol >8 mmol/L or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol >5.5 mmol/L, adjusted for age, ongoing lipid lowering therapy and presence of premature coronary artery disease) at increased risk for FH. When activated, the CDS will urge the physician to send an automatically generated referral to the local lipid clinic for further evaluation. To evaluate the effects of the CDS, all primary care clinics will be cluster randomized 1:1 to either CDS intervention or standard care in a Swedish region with almost 500,000 inhabitants. The primary endpoint will be the number of patients diagnosed with FH at 30 months. Resource use and long-term health consequences will be estimated to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.Despite increasing awareness of FH, the condition remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. The present study will investigate whether a CDS can increase the number of patients being diagnosed with FH.Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This manuscript provides a focused update of hyperthermia in the treatment of PSM.The heterogeneous response to hyperthermia in PSM can be explained by tumor and treatment conditions. PSM tumors may resist hyperthermia via metabolic and immunologic adaptation. The thermodynamics of HIPEC are complex and require computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The clinical evidence supporting the benefit of hyperthermia is largely observational. Continued research will allow clinicians to characterize and predict the individual response of PSM to hyperthermia. The application of hyperthermia in current HIPEC protocols is mostly empirical. Thus, modeling heat transfer with CFD is a necessary task if we are to achieve consistent and reproducible hyperthermia. Although observational evidence suggests a survival benefit of hyperthermia, no clinical trial has tested the individual role of hyperthermia in PSM.© 2022.

Each eye was imaged with spectral-domain OCT at three time points over 2 years. Retinal cavitations were manually segmented by a trained Reader and the retinal cavitation volume was calculated. Two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed that operated in sequential stages. In the first stage, CNN1 classified whether a B-scan contained any retinal cavitations. In the second stage, CNN2 segmented the retinal cavitations in a B-scan. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method against alternative methods using several performance metrics and manual segmentations as the gold standard.The proposed method was computationally efficient and accurately classified and segmented retinal cavitations on OCT images, with a sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.80 and average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.94±0.07 across all time points. The proposed method produced measurements that were highly correlated with the manual measurements of retinal cavitation volume and change in retinal cavitation volume over time.The proposed method will be useful to help clinicians quantify retinal cavitations, assess changes over time and further investigate the clinical significance of these early structural changes observed in MacTel2.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

The reason for the increased dead space is unclear, although pulmonary microvascular dysfunction and the corresponding capillary hypoperfusion is a potential mechanism. Despite emerging evidence that mild COPD is associated with pulmonary microvascular dysfunction, limited research has focused on experimentally modulating the pulmonary microvasculature during exercise in mild COPD. The present study sought to examine the effect of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), a selective pulmonary vasodilator, on V̇E / V̇CO2 , dyspnoea and exercise capacity in patients with mild COPD.

This is the first study to demonstrate that experimental manipulation of the pulmonary circulation alone, can positively impact dyspnoea and exercise capacity in mild COPD.Patients with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an exaggerated ventilatory response to exercise, contributing to dyspnoea and exercise intolerance. Previous research in mild COPD has demonstrated an elevated ventilatory equivalent to CO2 production ( V̇E / V̇CO2 ) during exercise, secondary to increased dead space ventilation. The reason for the increased dead space is unclear, although pulmonary microvascular dysfunction and the corresponding capillary hypoperfusion is a potential mechanism. The present study tested the hypothesis that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), a selective pulmonary vasodilator, would lower V̇E / V̇CO2 and dyspnoea, and improve exercise capacity in patients with mild COPD. In this multigroup randomized-control cross-over study, 15 patients with mild COPD (FEV1  =  89 ± 11% predicted) and 15 healthy controls completed symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise tests while breathing normoxic gas or 40 ppm iNO. Compared with placebo, iNO significantly increased peak oxygen uptake (1.80 ± 0.14 vs. 1.53 ± 0.10 L·min-1 , P < 0.001) in COPD, whereas no effect was observed in controls. At an equivalent work rate of 60 W, iNO reduced V̇E / V̇CO2 by 3.8 ± 4.2 units (P = 0.002) and dyspnoea by 1.1 ± 1.2 Borg units (P < 0.001) in COPD, whereas no effect was observed in controls. Operating lung volumes and oxygen saturation were unaffected by iNO in both groups. iNO increased peak oxygen uptake in COPD, secondary to reduced V̇E / V̇CO2 and dyspnoea. These data suggest that mild COPD patients demonstrate pulmonary microvascular dysfunction that contributes to increased V̇E / V̇CO2 , dyspnoea and exercise intolerance.

Artificial intelligence has shown promise in endoscopy, but few cystoscopic applications have been reported. We report a Cystoscopy Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System (CAIDS) for BCa diagnosis.In total, 69 204 images from 10 729 consecutive patients from 6 hospitals were collected and divided into training, internal validation, and external validation sets. The CAIDS was built using a pyramid scene parsing network and transfer learning. A subset (n = 260) of the validation sets was used for a performance comparison between the CAIDS and urologists for complex lesion detection. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.The diagnostic accuracies of the CAIDS were 0.977 (95% CI = 0.974 to 0.979) in the internal validation set and 0.990 (95% CI = 0.979 to 0.996), 0.982 (95% CI = 0.974 to 0.988), 0.978 (95% CI = 0.959 to 0.989), and 0.991 (95% CI = 0.987 to 0.994) in different external validation sets. In the CAIDS vs urologists' comparisons, the CAIDS showed high accuracy and sensitivity (accuracy = 0.939, 95% CI = 0.902 to 0.964; sensitivity = 0.954, 95% CI = 0.902 to 0.983) with a short latency of 12 seconds, much more accurate and quicker than the expert urologists.The CAIDS achieved accurate BCa detection with a short latency. The CAIDS may provide many clinical benefits, from increasing the diagnostic accuracy for BCa, even for commonly misdiagnosed cases such as flat cancerous tissue (carcinoma in situ), to reducing the operation time for cystoscopy.© The Author(s) 2021.

It is well known that if the treatments are not randomized (as in observational studies), covariate adjustment is necessary to account for treatment imbalances due to confounding factors. In this article, we propose a simple doubly-robust pseudo-value approach to effectively estimate the difference in the RML between two groups (akin to a metric for estimating average causal effects), while accounting for confounders. The proposed method combines two general approaches: (a) group-specific regression models for the time-to-event and covariate information, and (b) inverse probability of treatment assignment weights, where the RMLs are replaced by the corresponding pseudo-observations for survival outcomes, thereby mitigating the estimation complexities in presence of censoring. The proposed estimator is double-robust, in the sense that it is consistent if at least one of the two working models remains correct. In addition, we explore the potential of available machine learning algorithms in causal inference to reduce possible bias of the causal estimates in presence of a complex association between the survival outcome and covariates. We conduct extensive simulation studies to assess the finite-sample performance of the pseudo-value causal effect estimators. Furthermore, we illustrate our methodology via application to a dataset from a breast cancer cohort study. The proposed method is implementable using the R package drRML, available in GitHub.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",R01 DE024984|NIDCR NIH HHS|United States|P20 CA264067|NCI NIH HHS|United States|P20 CA252717|NCI NIH HHS|United States|P30 CA016059|NCI NIH HHS|United States,8/05/2022,D016428;D013485;D052061,10.1002/pst.2223,NA,1,1,,

Final pathology identified 422 (45%) MCTs, 405 (43%) other benign pathologies, and 119 (12%) malignancies. Preoperative imaging impression for MCTs had a 70% sensitivity, 92% specificity, 88% positive predictive value (PPV), and 79% negative predictive value (NPV). For the preoperative surgeon diagnosis, sensitivity was 59%, specificity 96%, PPV 92%, and NPV 74%. Some measures of diagnostic accuracy were affected by the presence of torsion, size of the lesion on imaging, imaging modality, and surgeon specialty. Of the 352 masses preoperatively thought to be MCTs, 14 were malignancies (4%). Eleven patients with inaccurately diagnosed malignancies had tumor markers evaluated and 82% had at least 1 elevated tumor marker, compared with 49% of those with MCTs.Diagnostic accuracy for the preoperative imaging impression and surgeon diagnosis is lower than expected for pediatric ovarian MCTs. For all ovarian neoplasms, preoperative risk assessment including a panel of tumor markers and a multidisciplinary review is recommended. This process could minimize the risk of misdiagnosis and improve operative planning to maximize the use of ovarian-sparing surgery for benign lesions and allow for appropriate resection and staging for lesions suspected to be malignant.Copyright © 2022.

Recently, sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) scoring was developed as a new criterion for coagulopathy-associated sepsis. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the SIC score for predicting the prognosis of septic shock. We analyzed data from a multicenter observational study conducted from 2011 to 2013. We grouped the participants into those who did and did not use vasopressors, and compared the in-hospital mortality rates of SIC and non-SIC patients. Patients who needed vasopressors were considered to have septic shock. We performed survival analysis adjusted by factors independently associated with mortality. SIC developed in 66.4% of patients who used vasopressors and 42.2% of patients who did not. The in-hospital mortality difference between the SIC and non-SIC groups was statistically significant in those who needed vasopressors (35.8% vs 27.9%, p < 0.01). Cox regression analysis indicated that SIC was significantly correlated with mortality risk in patients who used vasopressors (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.70; p < 0.01), but not in those who did not (HR 1.38; 95% CI 0.81-2.34; p = 0.23).

The development of imaging techniques for the diagnosis has led to several adenomyosis phenotypes being described, and fertility issues appear to vary according to the characteristics of the lesions. What makes assessment of the impact of adenomyosis on fertility issues even more difficult is its frequent association with endometriosis, which is another known risk factor of infertility. Although data suggest that adenomyosis may worsen the ART prognosis, there is no clear consensus regarding the impact of adenomyosis on ART outcomes in women affected by endometriosis.This was an observational study that included phenotyped patients with endometriosis, aged between 18 and 42 years, who underwent IVF/ICSI treatment in a tertiary care center between June 2015 and July 2018. Only women who had undergone a pelvic MRI during the pre-therapeutic ART workup were retained for this study. The MRI data were interpreted by radiologists who had expertise in gynecological MRI.A continuous series of 202 women affected by endometriosis was included. The women were monitored until four ART cycles had been completed, until delivery, or until discontinuation of treatment before the completion of four cycles. The primary outcome was the delivery of at least one live infant after up to four IVF/ICSI cycles. The patient and the MRI characteristics were compared between the women who achieved a live birth versus those who did not.The patients' mean age was 32.5 ± 3.7 years. Deep infiltrating endometriosis was present in 90.1% (182/202) of the included population. Adenomyosis (lesions of the internal and/or the external myometrium) was found in 71.8% (145/202) of the included women. The cumulative LBR was 57.4% (116/202). The women who gave birth were significantly younger (32.0 ± 3.3 versus 33.3 ± 4.1, P = 0.026) and had significantly better ovarian reserve parameters (anti-Müllerian hormone levels, antral follicle count) than those who did not. The presence of adenomyosis, irrespective of the phenotype (76/116 (65.5%) versus 69/86 (80.2%), respectively, P = 0.022) and the presence of T2 high-signal intensity myometrial spots (27/116 (23.3%) and 37/86 (43.0%), respectively, P = 0.003) was significantly less frequent in the group of women who gave birth versus those who did not. After multivariate analysis, the presence of adenomyosis (odds ratio (OR): 0.48, 95% CI (0.29-0.99), P = 0.048) and the presence of T2 high-signal intensity myometrial spots (OR: 0.43, 95% CI (0.22-0.86), P = 0.018) were independently found to be associated with a decrease in the cumulative chance of live birth.The inclusion of patients from a referral center specialized in the management of women affected by endometriosis could constitute a selection bias, as these women may have had particularly severe forms of adenomyosis and/or endometriosis. A sensitive issue is that there is no consensual classification of adenomyosis and several lesions of adenomyosis can co-exist. Therefore, a comparison of fertility outcomes between women with and without adenomyosis is difficult to perform in practice.In women exhibiting endometriosis, the practitioner should perform an appropriate imaging workup to search for adenomyosis, identify prognostic factors, and personalize the patient management strategy in the setting of ART.No funding was obtained and there were no conflicts of interest.N/A.© The Author(s) 2022.

Among patients affected by advanced glioblastoma or melanoma and treated with TEM, loss of tumoral O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is correlated with improved survival. In NEN patients, the role of MGMT deficiency in predicting clinical outcomes of TEM treatment is still under debate.In this study we evaluated 95 patients with advanced NENs undergoing treatment with TEM-based therapy. MGMT promoter methylation status was evaluated with two techniques: methylation specific-polymerase chain reaction or pyrosequencing.Treatment with TEM-based therapy was associated with an overall response rate of 27.4% according to RECIST criteria (51.8% of patients with and 17.7% without MGMT promoter methylation). Response to therapy, progression free survival and overall survival was correlated to MGMT status at univariate and multivariate analysis. Methylation of MGMT promoter could be a strong predictive factor of objective response and an important prognostic factor of a longer PFS and OS.According to our results, MGMT methylation status, evaluated with methylation specific-polymerase chain reaction or pyrosequencing, should have an important role in patients with metastatic NENs, in order to guide therapeutic options. These results need further confirmation with prospective studies.",NA,19/11/2017,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1007/s12020-017-1474-3,NA,1,0,,

However, genetic testing for BRCA1/BRCA2 PSVs is still not a routine practice in the Middle East. With the lack of epidemiological studies in the region, we aim to describe the prevalence of BRCA1/BRCA2 PSVs in patients with OC across different countries in the Gulf region.The PREDICT study was an observational, prospective, epidemiological study, which consecutively recruited women with ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers from the following Gulf countries over the period from July 2017 to July 2019; United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, and Oman. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of participating centers. The BRCA1/BRCA2 PSVs were assessed by tissue genetic testing using next-generation sequencing (NGS).A total of 105 women were included with a median age at diagnosis of 52 years (IQR 44.5 - 61.0). Nearly 11.4% of patients reported a family history of ovarian or breast cancer, while 4.7% of patients reported a family history of other cancers. Most of the patients (70.3%) had advanced disease (FIGO stage III/IV) at presentation. Eighty-eight patients (84%) were successfully tested for somatic BRCA1/BRCA2 PSVs. Fifteen patients (17%) were found to have PSVs in either BRCA1, BRCA2, or both genes; of them, 10 patients (11.2%) had BRCA1 somatic PSVs alone, eight patients (9.1%) had BRCA2 somatic PSVs, while three patients (2.9%) had both PSVs. Five patients with BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic PSVs had germline PSVs tests, and three of them tested positive. Concerning treatment, 87.6% of patients received perioperative chemotherapy and 6.6% as first-line palliative chemotherapy. Eighty-seven (82.9%) patients underwent debulking surgery, with no residual disease in 42.5% of patients.Our study showed that the prevalence of BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic PSVs in patients with OC is higher than the reported global figures (2-8%). However, more studies are warranted to further elucidate the prevalence of BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic and germline PSVs, as well as other relevant genetic alterations, to better understand their impact on OC patient outcomes in Gulf countries.NCT03082976 .© 2021.

Previous trials have acknowledged that MSI prevalence varies according to ethnicity. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of MSI among CRC patients from Costa Rica and to analyze its influence on overall survival (OS) and response to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.We conducted a retrospective cohort study with all diagnosed CRC cases from 2010 to 2015 in a referral center in San José, Costa Rica. MSI was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. Clinical and epidemiological variables were retrieved from medical records. An univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between MSI and mortality in the overall population and in those patients treated or not with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.553 CRC patients were identified during the study timeframe, and 165 of them were diagnosed with MSI (29.84 %; 95 % Confidence Interval CI: 26.02-33.65%). MSI was associated with M1 disease, and right-sided tumor location. After adjusting for potential confounders, MSI was an independent prognostic factor for OS (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.56; 95 %CI: 0.43-0.67; Log-rankp = 0.03). MSI status did not modify the response to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (HR: 0.56; 95 %CI: 0.18-1.80; Log-rank: p = 0.33).MSI was detected in a higher proportion of CRC patients than previously reported for other non-Hispanic populations. MSI was an independent prognostic factor for OS, but did not predict the efficacy of cytotoxic treatment with Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Consecutive women with abnormal vaginal bleeding presenting for ultrasound examination (n = 2,417) were recruited. The histology was obtained from endometrial sampling, D&amp;C, hysteroscopic resection, hysterectomy, or ultrasound follow-up for >1 year.A model was developed using multinomial regression based on age, body mass index, and ultrasound predictors to distinguish between: (1) endometrial atrophy, (2) endometrial polyp or intracavitary myoma, (3) endometrial malignancy or atypical hyperplasia, (4) proliferative/secretory changes, endometritis, or hyperplasia without atypia and validated using leave-center-out cross-validation and bootstrapping. The main outcomes are the model's ability to discriminate between the four outcomes and the calibration of risk estimates.The median age in 2,417 women was 50 (interquartile range 43-57). 414 (17%) women had endometrial atrophy; 996 (41%) had a polyp or myoma; 155 (6%) had an endometrial malignancy or atypical hyperplasia; and 852 (35%) had proliferative/secretory changes, endometritis, or hyperplasia without atypia. The model distinguished well between malignant and benign histology (c-statistic 0.88 95% CI: 0.85-0.91) and between all benign histologies. The probabilities for each of the four outcomes were over- or underestimated depending on the centers.Not all patients had a diagnosis based on histology. The model over- or underestimated the risk for certain outcomes in some centers, indicating local recalibration is advisable.The proposed model reliably distinguishes between four histological outcomes. This is the first model to discriminate between several outcomes and is the only model applicable when menopausal status is uncertain.

Quantitative electroencephalography program implementation included a continuous education and training package. Continuous quantitative electroencephalography monitoring consisted of two-channel amplitude-integrated electroencephalography, color density spectral array, and raw-electroencephalography.PICU.Children less than 18 years old admitted to the PICU during the 14-month study period and deemed at risk of electrographic seizure.None.Real time electrographic seizure detection by a PICU team was analyzed for diagnostic accuracy and promptness, against electrographic seizure identification by a trained neurophysiologist, retrospectively reading the same quantitative electroencephalography and blinded to patient details. One-hundred one of 1,510 consecutive admissions (6.7%) during the study period underwent quantitative electroencephalography monitoring. Status epilepticus (35%) and suspected hypoxic-ischemic injury (32%) were the most common indications for quantitative electroencephalography. Electrographic seizure was diagnosed by the neurophysiologist in 12% (n = 12) of the cohort. PICU clinicians correctly diagnosed all 12 patients (100% sensitivity and negative predictive value). An additional eleven patients had a false-positive diagnosis of electrographic seizure (false-positive rate = 52% [31-73%]) leading to a specificity of 88% (79-94%). Median time to detect seizures was 25 minutes (5-218 min). Delayed recognition of electrographic seizure (> 1 hr from onset) occurred in five patients (5/12, 42%).Early evaluation of quantitative electroencephalography program to detect electrographic seizure by PICU clinicians suggested good sensitivity for electrographic seizure detection.

This study investigated the complication rate of transbronchial biopsies in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit and its ability to obtain a diagnosis and change current therapy.PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were systematically searched for all publications of transbronchial lung biopsies in mechanically ventilated patients. We pooled the results of individual studies using random-effects meta-analysis models to achieve the summary proportions.Of the identified 9 observational studies with a total of 232 patients undergoing a transbronchial biopsy, complications occurred in 67 patients [25.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 11.5%-42.0%; I2=70.0%]. Pneumothorax occurred in 24 patients (9.5%; 95% CI, 4.5%-16.2%; I2=15.9%) and bleeding in 18 patients (8.9%; 95% CI, 4.1%-15.3%; I2=0%).

Patients were categorized into two groups based on their HLOS (<I week vs. >I week). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to determine the cutoff value for lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and P/LR ratio for predicting the prolonged hospitalization.One hundred and fifty-two patients were included in the study. The majority were young males. The mean age was 38.3 ± 12.7 years. Perforated duodenal ulcer (139 patients) exceeded perforated gastric ulcer (13 patients). The HLOS > 1 week was observed in 14.5% of cases. Older age (p = 0.01), higher preoperative WBC (p = 0.03), lower lymphocyte count (p = 0.01), and higher P/LR ratio (p = 0.005) were evident in the HLOS > 1 week group.

Patients will be recruited through a previous large-scale survey of unselected people with inflammatory bowel disease. The UK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and global rating of symptom relief at 6 months are the co-primary outcomes, with multiple secondary outcomes measured also at 6 and 12 months post randomisation to assess maintenance. The RCT has an embedded pilot study, health economics evaluation and process evaluation. We will randomise 680 patients, 340 in each group. Demographic characteristics and outcome measures will be presented for both study groups at baseline. The UK-IBDQ and global rating of symptom relief at 6 and 12 months post randomisation will be compared between the study groups.The BOOST online self-management programme for people with IBD-related symptoms of fatigue, pain and urgency has been designed to be easily scalable and implemented.

A summary risk score was also constructed for identifying postoperative AKI patients.Postoperative AKI occurred in 155 (18.4%) patients and was highly associated with in-hospital mortality (5.2% vs. 0.7%, P <  0.001). The six predictors selected and assembled into the nomogram included age, preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) usage, intraoperative hepatic inflow occlusion, blood loss, and transfusion. The predictive nomogram performed well in terms of discrimination with area under ROC curve (AUC) in training (0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-0.78) and validation (0.71, 95% CI: 0.63-0.80) datasets. The nomogram was well-calibrated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square value of 9.68 (P = 0.47). Decision curve analysis demonstrated a significant clinical benefit. The summary risk score calculated as the sum of points from the six variables (one point for each variable) performed as well as the nomogram in identifying the risk of AKI (AUC 0.71, 95% CI: 0.66-0.76).This nomogram and summary risk score accurately predicted postoperative AKI using six clinically accessible variables, with potential application in facilitating the optimized perioperative renal management in older patients undergoing liver resection.NCT04922866 , retrospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov on June 11, 2021.© 2022.

To assist with risk stratification, we developed a model to predict severe rebound pain after foot and ankle surgery involving single-shot popliteal sciatic nerve block.After ethics approval, we performed a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Patients undergoing lower limb surgery with popliteal sciatic nerve block from January 2016 to November 2019 were included. Exclusion criteria were uncontrolled pain in the PACU, use of a perineural catheter, or loss to follow-up. We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model for severe rebound pain, defined as transition from well-controlled pain in the PACU (numerical rating scale [NRS] 3 or less) to severe pain (NRS ≥7) within 48 h. A priori predictors were age, sex, surgery type, planned admission, local anaesthetic type, dexamethasone use, and intraoperative anaesthesia type. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), Nagelkerke's R2, scaled Brier score, and calibration slope.The cohort included 1365 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 50 [16] yr). The primary outcome was abstracted in 1311 (96%) patients, with severe rebound pain in 652 (50%). Internal validation revealed poor model performance, with AUROC 0.632 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.602-0.661; bootstrap optimisation 0.021), Nagelkerke's R2 0.063, and scaled Brier score 0.047. Calibration slope was 0.832 (95% CI: 0.623-1.041).We show that a multivariable risk prediction model developed using routinely collected clinical data had poor predictive performance for severe rebound pain after foot and ankle surgery.

There are studies that have evaluated the feasibility and safety of EUS-guided parenchymal liver biopsy (EUS-LB), however, factors that can influence specimen quality are yet to be determined. Our aim was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-LB and evaluate factors associated with specimen quality.We performed a detailed search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science™ databases to identify studies in which results of EUS-guided liver parenchymal biopsies were reported published up to July 2020. A random effects model was used to estimate pooled values (mean ± SE) for total specimen length (TSL) and complete portal tracts (CPT). Subgroup analyses were applied to find out the procedural factors associated with better specimen quality using Cochran's Q test. A total of 10 meta-analyses were done focusing on international studies. Total of 1326 patients who underwent EUS-LB. EUS-LBs performed for suspicion of parenchymal liver disease. Pooled mean values for TSL and CPT with subgroup analyses.Twenty-three studies with a total of 1326 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Overall pooled mean TSL and CPT were 45.3 ± 4.6 mm and 15.8 ± 1.5, respectively. In subgroup analysis, core biopsy needles proved to better in terms of CPT than fine-needle aspiration needles (18.4 vs 10.99, p = 0.003). FNB with slow-pull or suction technique provided a similar TSL (44.3 vs 53.9 mm, p = 0.40), however, slow-pull technique was better in terms of CPT (30 vs 14.6, p < 0.001). Heterogeneity was present among the studies. Another limitation is the low number randomized control trials.EUS-guided parenchymal liver biopsy is a good alternative to other methods of liver sampling. Using FNB needles with a slow-pull technique can provide better results.© 2020.

However, it is unclear whether there is clinically silent myocardial involvement at the early stage of PBC before cirrhosis and cardiac manifestations. This prospective, three-center, multi-modality cardiac imaging study on the early identification of myocardial impairment in PBC (EARLY-MYO-PBC) was designed to identify silent myocardial impairment in PBC patients without cardiac manifestations.A total of 112 subjects (56 with PBC and 56 age- and sex-matched controls) undergoing cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) were enrolled. Demographic, serologic, and cardiac imaging data were prospectively collected. All participants had no cardiac discomfort or previous heart disease and had normal electrocardiographic findings.Subclinical myocardial involvement, as evidenced by cardiac morphologic, functional, and tissue characterization changes on CMR, including hyperdynamic left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (median, 75% in PBC patients vs 69% in controls, P = .029), subclinical myocardial edema by T2-short tau inversion recovery (21% vs 2% in controls, P = .001), elevated extracellular matrix indices (30% vs 26% in controls, P < .001), and impaired myocardial viability by positive late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (36%), was detected in PBC patients. Importantly, a mid-wall ""stripe"" at the LV septum was identified as a PBC-specific LGE pattern that differs from other known cardiomyopathies. In multivariate analysis, gp210 positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 9.909, P = .010), lower hemoglobin (OR = 0.919, P = .004), and body mass index (OR = 0.638, P = .005) were independent predictors of cardiac abnormalities in PBC.This study demonstrates clinically silent cardiac impairment with specific CMR patterns in PBC, allowing optimal screening for early myocardial impairment and potentially timely therapies.

DETECT (NCT03556475) was a multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study aiming to develop and validate multivariable prediction models for AECOPD occurrence and severity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in China.Patients aged ≥40 years with moderate/severe COPD, AECOPD, or no COPD were consecutively enrolled between April 22, 2020, and January 18, 2021, across seven study sites in China. Multivariable prediction models were constructed to identify AECOPD occurrence (primary outcome) and AECOPD severity (secondary outcome). Candidate variables were selected using a stepwise procedure, and the bootstrap method was used for internal model validation.Among 299 patients enrolled, 246 were included in the final analysis, of whom 30.1%, 40.7%, and 29.3% had COPD, AECOPD, or no COPD, respectively.

To measure the levels of Aβ seeding activity in the plasma samples, we have developed an AD-seeds protein analyzer. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to quantify the ability of plasma Aβ seeding activity to distinguish between AD and NADD or NC individuals. Spearman's correlation was used to examine the associations between plasma Aβ seeding activity and global cognitive function or conventional AD biomarkers.The Aβ seeding activities were 0.83 (0.58-1.16) A.U. in AD, 0.42 (0.04-0.74) A.U. in NADD and 0.42 (0.09-0.69) A.U. in NC, respectively. The Aβ seeding activity was able to identify AD patients and distinguish them from NC or NADD with high accuracy (AUC = 0.85-0.86). In addition, the plasma Aβ seeding activity showed a strong correlation with cognitive performance (mini-mental state examination, r = - 0.188; Montreal cognitive assessment, r = - 0.189; clinical dementia rating, r = 0.205) and conventional biomarkers (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Aβ42/40, r = -0.227; CSF T-tau/Aβ42, r = 0.239; CSF P-tau/Aβ42, r = 0.259).Our results confirmed that plasma Aβ seeding activity is an antibody-free and low-cost biomarker for the diagnosis of AD.Trial registration number NCT04850053.© 2022.

A few studies, including a randomized trial, have demonstrated the efficacy of interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade with tocilizumab (TCZ) in GC-refractory GO. However, data on predictors of response to TCZ and long-term outcomes are lacking.Observational single-center study on ten consecutive patients treated with TCZ for GC-refractory GO, between 2016 and 2020. Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 24 (12-36) months.Inflammation and exophthalmos improved dramatically in all patients within months after starting TCZ. Mean Clinical Activity Score decreased from 4.80 ±  1.13 to 0.70 ± 0.82 points at 6 months (mean change: -4.10 ± 1.52; p < .0001). Proptosis improved from 23.2 ± 2.1 to 20.6 ± 2.0 mm at 6 months (mean change: -2.9 ± 1.4 mm; p < .0001). Diplopia resolved in 7 patients. Thyroid receptor antibodies decreased markedly during TCZ treatment. Baseline serum IL-6 levels did not predict clinical response. TCZ was well-tolerated. During follow-up, 3 patients were diagnosed with cancer (breast cancer in 2 and urothelial cancer in 1).TCZ was rapidly effective and well-tolerated in our patients with GC-refractory GO. Four patients experienced mild/moderate adverse events as neutropenia, hyperlipidemia, and infections; nearly a third developed cancer during the follow-up. The increased incidence observed could be explained by the high prevalence of smokers, that are at higher risk for Graves' orbitopathy and solid malignancies as breast cancer. Thus, regular cancer screening could be proposed to this vulnerable population receiving high doses of immunosuppressants.© 2021 The Authors.

Several deep learning-based computer-assisted detection (CADe) techniques were established from small single-center datasets, and unrepresentative learning materials might confine their application and generalization in wide practice. Although CADes have been reported to identify polyps in colonoscopic images and videos in real time, their diagnostic performance deserves to be further validated in clinical practice.To train and test a CADe based on multicenter high-quality images of polyps and preliminarily validate it in clinical colonoscopies.With high-quality screening and labeling from 55 qualified colonoscopists, a dataset consisting of over 71000 images from 20 centers was used to train and test a deep learning-based CADe. In addition, the real-time diagnostic performance of CADe was tested frame by frame in 47 unaltered full-ranged videos that contained 86 histologically confirmed polyps. Finally, we conducted a self-controlled observational study to validate the diagnostic performance of CADe in real-world colonoscopy with the main outcome measure of polyps per colonoscopy in Changhai Hospital.The CADe was able to identify polyps in the test dataset with 95.0% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. For colonoscopy videos, all 86 polyps were detected with 92.2% sensitivity and 93.6% specificity in frame-by-frame analysis. In the prospective validation, the sensitivity of CAD in identifying polyps was 98.4% (185/188). Folds, reflections of light and fecal fluid were the main causes of false positives in both the test dataset and clinical colonoscopies. Colonoscopists can detect more polyps (0.90 vs 0.82, P < 0.001) and adenomas (0.32 vs 0.30, P = 0.045) with the aid of CADe, particularly polyps < 5 mm and flat polyps (0.65 vs 0.57, P < 0.001; 0.74 vs 0.67, P = 0.001, respectively). However, high efficacy is not realized in colonoscopies with inadequate bowel preparation and withdrawal time (P = 0.32; P = 0.16, respectively).CADe is feasible in the clinical setting and might help endoscopists detect more polyps and adenomas, and further confirmation is warranted.©The Author(s) 2021.

The percentage increase was 15.8% (95% CI 12.3% to 19.4%) for the 2015-2016 cross-sectional analysis and 18.8% (95% CI 13.9% to 24.0%) for the 2013-2014 versus 2015-2016 repeated cross-sectional analysis. On average, the increased length of hospital stay was approximately 1 day.This study has shown that by comparing ESD and non-ESD patient groups matched for important patient characteristics, receiving ESD resulted in a 1-day increase in length of hospital stay. The large reduction in length of hospital stay overall, since original trials were conducted, may explain why a reduction was not observed.

The aim of this study was to assess whether use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive imaging tool, might avoid the need for biopsy.In a multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial, patients (aged ≥18 years) with an indication for biopsy of a suspected basal cell carcinoma outside the H-zone (high-risk zone) of the face were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either OCT or punch biopsy (regular care) via a web-based randomisation system. Patients were enrolled from three participating centres in the Netherlands: Maastricht University Medical Centre+, Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, and Zuyderland Medical Centre Heerlen. Stratification factors for randomisation were participating centre and the grade of clinical basal cell carcinoma suspicion (high vs low). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients free from a recurrent or residual lesion (malignant or premalignant) 12 months after treatment. Modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted, with a predefined non-inferiority margin of -10%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03848078, and is complete.Between Feb 25, 2019, and Sept 2, 2020, 598 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the regular care group (n=299) or the OCT group (n=299). Data on the primary endpoint were available in 553 patients (n=268 in the regular care group, n=285 in the OCT group). After median follow-up of 12·7 months (IQR 11·2-14·1) in the OCT group and 12·6 months (10·8-14·3) in the regular care group, 253 (94%) of 268 patients in the OCT group and 266 (93%) of 285 patients in the regular care group were free from recurrent or residual lesions (malignant or pre-malignant) 12 months after treatment. According to our modified intention-to-treat analysis, the absolute difference (OCT vs regular care) was 1·07% (95% CI -2·93 to 5·06; one-sided p=0·30), with the lower limit of the 95% CI not exceeding the predefined non-inferiority margin of -10%. Per-protocol analyses led to proportions free from a residual or recurrent lesion (premalignant or malignant) of 95% (250 of 263) in the OCT group and 94% (262 of 278) in the regular care group, and an absolute difference of 0·81% (95% CI -2·98 to 4·60; one-sided p=0·34).OCT-guided diagnosis and treatment of basal cell carcinoma is non-inferior to regular care punch biopsy. Implementation of OCT for diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma could reduce the number of consultations and invasive procedures.The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development and Maurits en Anna de Kock Stichting.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the association between PCM and the institution of stroke preventive strategies and stroke recurrence.We searched MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases to identify studies reporting stroke recurrence rates in patients with history of recent IS or TIA receiving PCM compared with patients receiving conventional cardiac rhythm monitoring. Pairwise meta-analyses were performed under the random effects model. To explore for differences between the monitoring strategies, we combined direct and indirect evidence for any given pair of monitoring devices assessed within a randomized controlled trial (RCT).We included 8 studies (5 RCTs, 3 observational; 2,994 patients). Patients receiving PCM after their index event had a higher rate of AF detection and anticoagulant initiation in RCTs (risk ratio [RR] 3.91, 95% CI 2.54-6.03; RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.66-2.80, respectively) and observational studies (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.57-2.70; RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.43-2.83, respectively). PCM was associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke during follow-up in observational studies (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15-0.59), but not in RCTs (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49-1.07). In indirect analyses of RCTs, the likelihood of AF detection and anticoagulation initiation was higher for implantable loop recorders compared with Holter monitors and external loop recorders.PCM after an IS or TIA can lead to higher rates of AF detection and anticoagulant initiation.

One retrospective set (N = 1261) was used to develop and internally validate the predictive model. The clinical, radiological and laboratory features were collected and subjected to logistic regression analyses. The primary predictive model was displayed as a nomogram and then modified into a novel scoring system, which was externally validated in an independent set (N = 172).The novel scoring system was composed of fever (3 points), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (4 points), effusion adenosine deaminase (7 points), serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (4 points), effusion CEA (10 points) and effusion/serum CEA (8 points). With a cutoff value of 15 points, the area under the curve, specificity and sensitivity for identifying MPE were 0.913, 89.10%, and 82.63%, respectively, in the training set, 0.922, 93.48%, 81.51%, respectively, in the internal validation set and 0.912, 87.61%, 81.36%, respectively, in the external validation set. Moreover, this scoring system was exclusively applied to distinguish lung cancer with PE from tuberculous pleurisy and showed a favourable diagnostic performance in the training and validation sets.This novel scoring system was developed from a retrospective study and externally validated in an independent set based on six easily accessible clinical variables, and it exhibited good diagnostic performance for identifying MPE.NFSC grants (no. 81572942, no. 81800094).Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

This is a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter, observational study and it was conducted in three Italian Obstetric Units (Pisa, Massa Carrara and Prato). All term pregnant women, either nulliparous and multiparous, with singleton pregnancy and a cephalic fetus, with spontaneous or induced labour, requiring vacuum-assisted delivery were enrolled. Indications to operative vaginal delivery were grouped as alterations of fetal cardiotocography (CTG) patterns, delay/arrest of second stage of labour or elective shortening of second stage of labour. A board consisting of five among authors evaluated appropriateness of the procedure.Overall, 466 women undergoing operative vaginal deliveries were included. Cardiotocography, classified as ACOG category 2 or 3 was the indication for vacuum assisted delivery in 253 patients (54.29%). Among these, 66 women (26.1%) had an operative vaginal delivery which was then considered to be inappropriate, while in 114 cases (45.1%) CTG traces resulted to be unreadable.Decision making process, which leads clinicians to go for operative vaginal delivery, is often influenced by shortness of time and complexity of the situation. Therefore, clinicians tend to intervene performing vacuum delivery without adopting critical analysis and without adequately considering the clinical situation. Operative vaginal delivery might be a risky procedure and should be performed only when clinically indicated and after adequate critical analysis.© 2022.

Dynamic prediction of tumour regression by NAC may allow for adaption of the treatment plan before completion, or even before the start of treatment. Such predictions may help prevent overtreatment and related toxicity and correct for undertreatment with ineffective regimens. Current imaging methods are not able to fully predict the efficacy of NAC. To successfully improve response prediction, tumour biology and heterogeneity as well as treatment-induced changes have to be considered. In the LIMA study, multiparametric MRI will be combined with liquid biopsies. In addition to conventional clinical and pathological information, these methods may give complementary information at multiple time points during treatment.To combine multiparametric MRI and liquid biopsies in patients with breast cancer to predict residual cancer burden (RCB) after NAC, in adjunct to standard clinico-pathological information. Predictions will be made before the start of NAC, approximately halfway during treatment and after completion of NAC.In this multicentre prospective observational study we aim to enrol 100 patients. Multiparametric MRI will be performed prior to NAC, approximately halfway and after completion of NAC. Liquid biopsies will be obtained immediately prior to every cycle of chemotherapy and after completion of NAC. The primary endpoint is RCB in the surgical resection specimen following NAC.

With self-collection kits, participants can contribute genetic samples conveniently from their home. Demographic and clinical factors were identified previously that influenced participation in mailed self-collection. People with pre-existing heritable diagnoses might participate differently in germline DNA collection which might render sampling biased in this group. In this nationwide cross-sectional study, we analysed predictive factors of participation in DNA self-collection including heritable diagnoses.We identified childhood cancer survivors from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry for invitation to germline DNA self-sampling in September 2019. Participants received saliva sampling kits by postal mail at their home, were asked to fill them, sign an informed consent, and send them back by mail. Two reminders were sent to non-participants by mail. We compared demographic, clinical, and treatment information of participants with non-participants using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.We invited 928 childhood cancer survivors in Switzerland with a median age of 26.5 years (interquartile range 19-37), of which 463 (50%) participated. After the initial send out of the sampling kit, 291 (63%) had participated, while reminder letters led to 172 additional participants (37%). Foreign nationality (odds ratio [OR] 0.5; 95%-confidence interval [CI] 0.4-0.7), survivors aged 30-39 years at study versus other age groups (OR 0.5; CI 0.4-0.8), and survivors with a known cancer predisposition syndrome (OR 0.5; CI 0.3-1.0) were less likely to participate in germline DNA collection. Survivors with a second primary neoplasm (OR 1.9; CI 1.0-3.8) or those living in a French or Italian speaking region (OR 1.3; CI 1.0-1.8) tended to participate more.We showed that half of childhood cancer survivors participated in germline DNA self-sampling relying completely on mailing of sample kits. Written reminders increased the response by about one third. More targeted recruitment strategies may be advocated for people of foreign nationality, aged 30-39 years, and those with cancer predisposition syndromes.

We investigated the radiological and prognostic associations of preexisting cognitive impairment in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack associated with atrial fibrillation. Methods and Results We included 1102 patients from the prospective multicenter observational CROMIS-2 (Clinical Relevance of Microbleeds in Stroke 2) atrial fibrillation study. Preexisting cognitive impairment was identified using the 16-item Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. Functional outcome was measured using the modified Rankin scale. Preexisting cognitive impairment was common (n=271; 24.6%). The presence of lacunes (odds ratio [OR], 1.50; 95% CI, 1.03-1.05; P=0.034), increasing periventricular white matter hyperintensity grade (per grade increase, OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.17-1.63; P<0.0001), deep white matter hyperintensity grade (per grade increase, OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.51; P=0.011), and medial temporal atrophy grade (per grade increase, OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.34-1.95; P<0.0001) were independently associated with preexisting cognitive impairment. Preexisting cognitive impairment was associated with poorer functional outcome at 24 months (mRS >2; adjusted OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.42-4.20; P=0.001). Conclusions Preexisting cognitive impairment in patients with atrial fibrillation-associated ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack is common, and associated with imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease and neurodegeneration, as well as with longer-term functional outcome.

Conflicting data have yet to elucidate optimal thromboprophylaxis dosing. HEP-COVID (NCT04401293) is a phase 3, multicenter, pragmatic, prospective, randomized, pseudo-blinded, active control trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of therapeutic-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) versus prophylactic-/intermediate-dose LMWH or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for prevention of a primary efficacy composite outcome of VTE, ATE, and all-cause mortality 30 ± 2 days post-enrollment. Eligible patients have COVID-19 diagnosis by nasal swab or serologic testing, requirement for supplemental oxygen per investigator judgment, and Dd >4 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or sepsis-induced coagulopathy score ≥4.

The consequences of inappropriate early or late delivery are potentially important yet practice varies widely around the world, with abnormal findings from fetal heart rate monitoring invariably leading to delivery. Indices derived from fetal cerebral Doppler examination may guide such decisions although there are few studies in this area. We propose a randomised, controlled trial to establish the optimum method of timing delivery between 32 weeks and 36 weeks 6 days of gestation. We hypothesise that delivery on evidence of cerebral blood flow redistribution reduces a composite of perinatal poor outcome, death and short-term hypoxia-related morbidity, with no worsening of neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years.Women with non-anomalous singleton pregnancies 32+0 to 36+6 weeks of gestation in whom the estimated fetal weight or abdominal circumference is <10th percentile or has decreased by 50 percentiles since 18-32 weeks will be included for observational data collection. Participants will be randomised if cerebral blood flow redistribution is identified, based on umbilical to middle cerebral artery pulsatility index ratio values. Computerised cardiotocography (cCTG) must show normal fetal heart rate short term variation (≥4.5 msec) and absence of decelerations at randomisation. Randomisation will be 1:1 to immediate delivery or delayed delivery (based on cCTG abnormalities or other worsening fetal condition).

All of these patients were followed up for over 1 year and their clinical characteristics were retrieved from electronic medical records. The endpoint was BNR, defined as alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase >1.5× upper limit of normal or alkaline phosphatase >1.1× ULN, at 12 months from chronic DILI diagnosis. The noninvasive high-risk factors for BNR identified by multivariable logistic regression were used to establish a nomogram, which was validated in an independent external cohort. Finally, 19.3% (707 of 3655) patients presented with BNR. Histologically, with the increase in liver inflammation grades and fibrosis stages, the proportion of BNR significantly increased. The risk of BNR was increased by 21.3-fold in patients with significant inflammation compared to none or mild inflammation (p < 0.001). Biochemically, aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin, platelets, prothrombin time, sex, and age were associated with BNR and incorporated to construct a nomogram model (BNR-6) with a concordance index of 0.824 (95% CI, 0.798-0.849), which was highly consistent with liver histology.

The impact of these technologies on these health professionals' performance and patient outcomes has not been systematically reviewed. We aimed to conduct a systematic review to investigate this.The following bibliographic databases and grey literature sources were searched by an experienced Information Professional for published and unpublished research from inception to February 2021 without language restrictions: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase Classic+Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), HMIC (Ovid), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Wiley), Social Sciences Citation Index Expanded (Clarivate), ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Abstracts & Index, ProQuest ASSIA (Applied Social Science Index and Abstract), Clinical Trials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP), Health Services Research Projects in Progress (HSRProj), OpenClinical(www.OpenClinical.org), OpenGrey (www.opengrey.eu), Health.IT.gov, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (www.ahrq.gov). Any comparative research studies comparing CDSS with usual care were eligible for inclusion.A total of 36 106 non-duplicate records were identified. Of 35 included studies: 28 were randomised trials, three controlled-before-and-after studies, three interrupted-time-series and one non-randomised trial. There were ~1318 health professionals and ~67 595 patient participants in the studies. Most studies focused on nurse decision-makers (71%) or paramedics (5.7%). CDSS as a standalone Personal Computer/LAPTOP-technology was a feature of 88.7% of the studies; only 8.6% of the studies involved 'smart' mobile/handheld-technology.CDSS impacted 38% of the outcome measures used positively. Care processes were better in 47% of the measures adopted; examples included, nurses' adherence to hand disinfection guidance, insulin dosing, on-time blood sampling and documenting care. Patient care outcomes in 40.7% of indicators were better; examples included, lower numbers of falls and pressure ulcers, better glycaemic control, screening of malnutrition and obesity and triaging appropriateness.CDSS may have a positive impact on selected aspects of nurses' and AHPs' performance and care outcomes. However, comparative research is generally low quality, with a wide range of heterogeneous outcomes. After more than 13 years of synthesised research into CDSS in healthcare professions other than medicine, the need for better quality evaluative research remains as pressing.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

We developed a strategy for the clinical validation of deep learning models for segmenting primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours and involved lymph nodes in CT images, which is a time-intensive step in radiation treatment planning, with large variability among experts.In this observational study, CT images and segmentations were collected from eight internal and external sources from the USA, the Netherlands, Canada, and China, with patients from the Maastro and Harvard-RT1 datasets used for model discovery (segmented by a single expert). Validation consisted of interobserver and intraobserver benchmarking, primary validation, functional validation, and end-user testing on the following datasets: multi-delineation, Harvard-RT1, Harvard-RT2, RTOG-0617, NSCLC-radiogenomics, Lung-PET-CT-Dx, RIDER, and thorax phantom. Primary validation consisted of stepwise testing on increasingly external datasets using measures of overlap including volumetric dice (VD) and surface dice (SD). Functional validation explored dosimetric effect, model failure modes, test-retest stability, and accuracy. End-user testing with eight experts assessed automated segmentations in a simulated clinical setting.We included 2208 patients imaged between 2001 and 2015, with 787 patients used for model discovery and 1421 for model validation, including 28 patients for end-user testing. Models showed an improvement over the interobserver benchmark (multi-delineation dataset; VD 0·91 [IQR 0·83-0·92], p=0·0062; SD 0·86 [0·71-0·91], p=0·0005), and were within the intraobserver benchmark. For primary validation, AI performance on internal Harvard-RT1 data (segmented by the same expert who segmented the discovery data) was VD 0·83 (IQR 0·76-0·88) and SD 0·79 (0·68-0·88), within the interobserver benchmark. Performance on internal Harvard-RT2 data segmented by other experts was VD 0·70 (0·56-0·80) and SD 0·50 (0·34-0·71). Performance on RTOG-0617 clinical trial data was VD 0·71 (0·60-0·81) and SD 0·47 (0·35-0·59), with similar results on diagnostic radiology datasets NSCLC-radiogenomics and Lung-PET-CT-Dx. Despite these geometric overlap results, models yielded target volumes with equivalent radiation dose coverage to those of experts. We also found non-significant differences between de novo expert and AI-assisted segmentations. AI assistance led to a 65% reduction in segmentation time (5·4 min; p<0·0001) and a 32% reduction in interobserver variability (SD; p=0·013).We present a clinical validation strategy for AI models. We found that in silico geometric segmentation metrics might not correlate with clinical utility of the models. Experts' segmentation style and preference might affect model performance.US National Institutes of Health and EU European Research Council.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Outcome was defined as all-cause mortality.6144 patients were enrolled: 71% had HF and 29% had no HF. Patients with N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) >2000 pg/mL were more likely to have HF than those with NT-proBNP of 400-2000 pg/mL (92% vs 64%, respectively). Frequency of HF phenotypes include: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (33%), HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (29%), HF due to valvular heart disease (4%), HF due to pulmonary hypertension (5%) and HF due to right ventricular systolic dysfunction (1%). There were 1485 (24%) deaths over a maximum follow-up of 6 years. The death rate was higher in HF versus no HF (11.49 vs 7.29 per 100 patient-years follow-up, p<0.0001). Patients with HF and an NT-proBNP >2000 pg/mL had lower survival than those with NT-proBNP 400-2000 pg/mL (3.8 years vs 5 years, p<0.0001). Propensity matched survival curves were comparable between HFpEF and HFrEF (p=0.88).Our findings support the use by NICE's HF diagnostic algorithm of tiered triage of patients with suspected HF based on their NT-proBNP levels. The two pathways yielded distinctive groups of patients with varied diagnoses and prognosis. HFpEF is the most frequent diagnosis, with its challenges of poor prognosis and paucity of therapeutic options.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Experts suggest cytology-based strategies developed for cervical cancer screening may prevent anal cancer by detecting anal cytologic or histological high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (hHSIL) for treatment. Currently, there is no consensus on anal-hHSIL screening strategies for WLHIV.Between 2014 and 2016, 276 WLHIV were recruited at 12 US AIDS Malignancy Consortium clinical trials sites to evaluate hHSIL prevalence and (test) screening strategies.Participants completed detailed questionnaire, underwent anal assessments including high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing using hrHPV-Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) and hrHPV-APTIMA, anal cytology, and concurrent high-resolution anoscopy. Screening test characteristics for predicting hHSIL validated by central review of histologic diagnosis were estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and false-omission rate. Paired analyses compared sensitivity and specificity for hrHPV single tests to anal cytology alone.83% (229/276) of enrolled WLHIV had complete anal assessment data and were included in this analysis. Mean age was 50, 62% black and 60 (26%) had hHSIL. Anal cyotology (>atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), hrHPV-HC2, and hrHPV-APTIMA sensitivity estimates were similarly high (83, 77, and 75%, respectively, P values > 0.2). Specificity was higher for both hrHPV-APTIMA and hrHPV-HC2 compared with anal cytology (67 vs. 50%, P < 0.001) and (61 vs. 50%, P = 0.020), respectively.Anal hrHPV testing demonstrated similar sensitivity for anal cytology (>atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) to predict anal hHSIL. Among tests with similar sensitivity, the specificity was significantly higher for hrHPV-APTIMA and hrHPV-HC2. Thus, anal hrHPV testing may be an important alternative strategy to anal cytology for anal hHSIL screening among WLHIV.",L30 CA153968|NCI NIH HHS|United States|R01 CA163103|NCI NIH HHS|United States|U01 CA121947|NCI NIH HHS|United States,19/09/2020,D016428;D052061;D013485,10.1097/QAD.0000000000002694,NA,0,0,,

Air pollution exposure could adversely impact pregnancy complications; however, evidence remains limited in China, where ambient air pollution is relatively severe.This study aims to examine the associations of GH, PE, and GDM with exposure to six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO) during pregnancy.Leveraging a multicenter birth cohort study among pregnant women in 24 hospitals from 15 provinces in China, we obtained data for maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes. We generated ambient concentrations of the six air pollutants using a combination of chemical transport model simulations with monitoring data. We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the effects on pregnancy complications from exposure to six air pollutants in each trimester and the entire pregnancy.Among the total 3754 pregnant women in this study, the prevalences of GH, GDM, and PE were 2.6 %, 11.2 %, and 0.7 %, respectively. GH risk increased 11.9 % (95 % CI, -8.5 %, 36.8 %) and 13.8 % (1.4 %, 27.8 %) per 10 μg/m3 increases in PM2.5 and PM10 in the entire pregnancy, respectively. PM2.5 and PM10 exposures in the first trimester were significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. Exposure to O3, SO2, NO2, and CO in early pregnancy could be associated with GDM risk. Geographic region and season of conception may influence the associations of GH and PE with air pollution.Ambient particulate matter pollution adversely affects GH, GDM, and PE among Chinese pregnant women. Since most regions of China still suffer from hazardous levels of air pollution, our findings indicate importance of better protecting pregnant women from the risk of air pollution.Copyright © 2022.

We developed a new in-house algorithm for MRPI 2.0 calculation and assessed its performance in distinguishing PSP-P from PD and control subjects in both cohorts using receiver operating characteristic curves.The automated MRPI 2.0 showed excellent performance in differentiating patients with PSP-P from patients with PD and control subjects both in the training cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.93 [95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.98] and AUC = 0.97 [0.93-1.00], respectively) and in the international testing cohort (PSP-P versus PD, AUC = 0.92 [0.87-0.97]; PSP-P versus controls, AUC = 0.94 [0.90-0.98]), suggesting the generalizability of the results. The automated MRPI 2.0 also accurately distinguished between PSP-P and PD in the early stage of the diseases (AUC = 0.91 [0.84-0.97]). A strong correlation (r = 0.91, P < 0.001) was found between automated and manual MRPI 2.0 values.Our study provides an automated, validated, and generalizable magnetic resonance biomarker to distinguish PSP-P from PD. The use of the automated MRPI 2.0 algorithm rather than manual measurements could be important to standardize measures in patients with PSP-P across centers, with a positive impact on multicenter studies and clinical trials involving patients from different geographic regions. © 2022 The Authors.

We aimed to identify factors associated with AF progression.Atrial fibrillation progression was assessed in 392 patients with recent-onset paroxysmal or persistent AF included in the prospective, observational, multicentre identification of a risk profile to guide atrial fibrillation (AF-RISK) study. Progression of AF was assessed by Holter monitoring and 2-week event recorder at baseline and 1-year follow-up. AF progression was defined as: (i) doubling in AF burden at 1 year compared to baseline with a minimum AF burden of 10% in paroxysmal AF; or (ii) transition from paroxysmal to persistent or permanent AF; or (iii) persistent to permanent AF. Age was 60 ± 11 years, 62% were men, and 83% had paroxysmal AF. At 1 year, 52 (13%) had AF progression (11% in paroxysmal; 26% in persistent AF). Multivariable logistic regression showed that left atrial volume [odds ratio (OR) per 10 mL 1.251, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.078-1.450; P < 0.001], N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; OR per standard deviation increase 1.583, 95% CI 1.099-2.281; P = 0.014), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; OR per standard deviation increase 0.660, 95% CI 0.472-0.921; P = 0.015) were associated with AF progression.

The aim of this study is to comprehensively investigate the maternal and neonatal outcomes related to aspirin prophylaxis during pregnancy in relation to dose and therapy initiation by utilizing a stratification method.Placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating the effect of low-dose aspirin on maternal or perinatal outcomes with sufficient raw data and published in English from inception to August 2020 were searched for from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Review articles, editorials, case reports, conference abstracts, and nonplacebo-controlled studies were excluded.A total of 35 placebo-controlled randomized trials with 46,568 pregnant women were included in this meta-analysis. Aspirin prophylaxis substantially lowered the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, perinatal mortality, and intrauterine growth retardation without elevated bleeding risks. Low-dose aspirin considerably enhanced neonatal birth weight but did not decrease the risk of gestational hypertension. The subgroup analysis revealed substantially reduced pre-eclampsia risk and enhanced birth weight and gestational age at delivery in women who initiated aspirin before 20 weeks of gestation (RR=0.76, 95% CI=0.64, 0.90, p=0.001).

Majority of the physicians use sepsis as a prototype to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 as there are similarities. Heat-killed Mycobacterium w (Mw) (Inj. Mw®) is a known immunomodulator, which is approved for the treatment of gram-negative sepsis. This observational study was aimed to evaluate the role of Mw along with standard of care (SOC) in critically ill COVID-19 patients.Total 448 patients' data (intervention group: 298 in Mw plus SOC vs 150 in SOC alone) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed critically ill COVID-19 patients who were admitted at five tertiary care centers were evaluated. They were observed for changes in laboratory [C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] parameters, hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and discharge status after giving 0.3 mL intradermal Mw for 3 consecutive days along with SOC during hospitalization. Standard of care included injectable steroids, remdesivir, and heparin. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.2 (StataCorp., College Station, Texas, USA).In baseline characteristics, Mw plus SOC arm had more critically ill patients as seen by higher high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) score, higher lab values [CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, LDH, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)], and more oxygen requirement as compared to SOC alone. Mycobacterium w arm had significantly higher mortality rate in ICU and hospital. Both hospital stay and ICU stay were longer in Mw arm. However, subgroup analysis found that early initiation of Mw (<3 days vs >3 days) was associated with significantly lesser odds of mortality and lesser odds of intubation requirement. Early initiation of Mw (<3 days vs >3 days) also resulted in significantly lesser duration of stay in the ICU along with reduction of CRP, D-dimer, and LDH. Moreover, further analysis of early initiation of Mw (<3 days vs control) resulted in significant reduction in lab values (procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer).Mw when added to SOC was found to associate with significantly increased risk of mortality and increased length of hospital stay. However, time since admission to administration of Mw was a significant predictor of in-ICU deaths in multivariate analysis. Early initiation of Mw (<3 days) was observed to be a protective factor against ICU deaths from the multivariate logistic regression model.

A score of mismatch was defined as MIS. Based on a short-term clinical label, 456 radiomics features were evaluated with feature selection methods. R score was constructed with the selected features. To compare the predictive capabilities of the clinical factors, MIS, and R score, three nomograms were developed and evaluated, according to the short-term clinical assessment on day 7. Finally, the radiomics nomogram was validated by predicting the 3-month clinical outcomes of AIS patients, in an external cohort.R scores were found to be significantly higher in patients with favorable clinical outcomes in both training and validation datasets.

A phase 3 trial (SPARE) was attempted in the UK, however, was deemed infeasible and closed.To emulate the SPARE trial using observational data.We identified patients aged 40 to 79 with cT2-3cN0cM0 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder diagnosed from 2006 to 2015 who were treated with multiagent neoadjuvant chemotherapy + RC with lymphadenectomy (RC arm) or multiagent chemotherapy + 3D conformal radiotherapy to the bladder (TMT arm) in the National Cancer Database.The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). We fit a flexible logistic regression model for treatment to estimate the propensity score, and then used inverse probability of treatment weights to evaluate the associations of treatment group with OS.A total of 2,048 patients were included, of whom 1,812 underwent RC and 236 underwent TMT. Median follow-up was 29.0 months. After propensity score adjustment, compared to TMT, RC was not associated with a statistically significant difference in OS (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.64-1.19; P = 0.40). When examining heterogeneity of treatment effects, RC appeared to be associated with improved OS only for patients with cT3 disease. Similar results were observed in sensitivity analyses. Our study is limited by the retrospective design and the lack of cancer-specific survival data.In observational analyses designed to emulate the SPARE trial, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between RC and TMT. Heterogeneity of treatment effects suggested improved survival with RC only for cT3 disease.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

To improve the targeting of potential participants for exclusive therapy offers from payers, Freytag et al. developed a tool to classify back pain chronicity classes (CC) based on claim data. The aim of this study was to evaluate the criterion validity of the model. Administrative claim data and self-reported patient information from 3,506 participants (2014-2021) in a private health insurance health management programme in Germany were used to validate the tool. Sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC) were calculated comparing the prediction with actual grades based on von Korff's graded chronic pain scale (GCPS). The secondary outcome was an updated view on direct health care costs (€) of patients with back pain (BP) grouped by GCPS. Results showed a fair correlation between predicted CC and actual GCPS grades. A total of 69.7% of all cases were correctly classified. Sensitivity and specificity rates of 54.6 and 76.4% underlined precision. Correlation between CC and GCPS with an MCC of 0.304 also indicated a fair relationship between prediction and observation. Cost data could be clearly grouped by GCPS: the higher the grade, the higher the costs and the use of health care. This was the first study to compare the predicted severity of BP using claim data with the actual severity of BP by GCPS. Based on the results, the usage of CC as a single tool to determine who receives CLBP treatment cannot be recommended. CC is a good tool to segment candidates for specific types of intervention in BP. However, it cannot replace a medical screening at the beginning of an intervention, as the rate of false negatives is too high. Trial registration The study was conducted using routinely collected data from an intervention, which was previously evaluated and registered retrospectively in the German Registry of Clinical Trials under DRKS00015463 (04/09/2018).

Valid biomarkers with predictive and explanatory properties are required. Therefore, we have investigated traditional and novel biomarkers of inflammation and immune modulation and their association to objectively measured sedentary behaviour in an ischemic stroke population.Patients admitted to hospital with acute ischemic stroke were included in the multicentre Norwegian Cognitive Impairment After Stroke (Nor-COAST) study (n = 815). For this sub-study (n = 257), sedentary behaviour was registered 3 months after stroke using position transition data from the body-worn sensor, ActivPal®. Blood samples were analysed for high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 10 (IL-10), neopterin, tryptophan (Trp), kynurenine (kyn), kynurenic acid (KA), and three B6 vitamers, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxal (PL), and pyridoxic acid (PA). The kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (KTR) and the pyridoxic acid ratio index (PAr = PA: PL + PLP) were calculated.Of the 815 patients included in the main study, 700 attended the three-month follow-up, and 257 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this study. Sedentary time was significantly associated with levels of hsCRP, IL-6, neopterin, PAr-index, and KA adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, and creatinine. In a fully adjusted model including all the significant biomarkers except hsCRP (because of missing values), sedentary time was independently positively associated with the PAr-index and negatively with KA. We did not find an association between sedentary behaviour, IL-10, and KTR.The PAr-index is known to capture several modes of inflammation and has previously shown predictive abilities for future stroke. This novel result indicates that the PAr-index could be a useful biomarker in future studies on sedentary behaviour and disease progression. KA is an important modulator of inflammation, and this finding opens new and exciting pathways to understand the hazards of sedentary behaviour.The study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT02650531 ).

We used several machine learning algorithms to construct prediction models for the functional outcomes of robotic neurorehabilitation in adult patients.Data of 139 patients who underwent Lokomat training at Taipei Medical University Hospital were retrospectively collected. After screening for data completeness, records of 91 adult patients with acute or chronic neurological disorders were included in this study. Patient characteristics and quantitative data from Lokomat were incorporated as features to construct prediction models to explore early responses and factors associated with patient recovery.Experimental results using the random forest algorithm achieved the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9813 with data extracted from all sessions. Body weight (BW) support played a key role in influencing the progress of functional ambulation categories. The analysis identified negative correlations of BW support, guidance force, and days required to complete 12 Lokomat sessions with the occurrence of progress, while a positive correlation was observed with regard to speed.We developed a predictive model for ambulatory outcomes based on patient characteristics and quantitative data on impairment reduction with early-stage robotic neurorehabilitation. RAGT is a customized approach for patients with different conditions to regain walking ability. To obtain a more-precise and clearer predictive model, collecting more RAGT training parameters and analyzing them for each individual disorder is a possible approach to help clinicians achieve a better understanding of the most efficient RAGT parameters for different patients.Retrospectively registered.© 2021.

When suspected, cervical MRI helps to reveal spinal cord compression and rules out alternative diagnoses. However, the correlation between radiological findings and symptoms is weak. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) analysis may complement the appreciation of cord compression and be used for intraoperative and postoperative monitorings in patients undergoing surgical decompression.Twenty patients diagnosed with DCM undergoing surgical decompression will receive standardised lumbar CSFP monitoring immediately before, during and 24 hours after operation. Rest (ie, opening pressure, CSF pulsation) and stimulated (ie, Valsalva, Queckenstedt's) CSFP-findings in DCM will be compared with 20 controls and results from CSFP monitoring will be related to clinical and neurophysiological findings. Arterial blood pressure will be recorded perioperatively and postoperatively to calculate spinal cord perfusion pressure and spinal vascular reactivity index. Furthermore, measures of CSFP will be compared with markers of spinal cord compression by means of MR imaging.The study protocol conformed to the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Zurich (KEK-ZH number PB-2016-00623). The main publications from this study will cover the CSFP fluid dynamics and pressure analysis preoperative, perioperative and postoperative correlated with imaging, clinical scores and neurophysiology. Other publications will deal with preoperative and postoperative spinal perfusion. Furthermore, we will disseminate an analysis on waveform morphology and the correlation with blood pressure and ECG.

A total of 3636 eligible patients with existing or newly diagnosed high-risk localised prostate cancer (HRL), non-metastatic biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (M0), or metastatic prostate cancer (M1), were consecutively enrolled and are being followed-up for 5 years. Patient history, demographic and disease characteristics, treatment and treatment decisions, were collected at first prostate cancer diagnosis and at enrolment. Patient-reported quality of life was prospectively assessed using the European Quality of Life-five Dimensions, five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate Cancer questionnaires. In the present study, we report the first interim analysis of 2063 patients enrolled from study start (15 September 2015) until 18 May 2017.Of the 2063 enrolled patients, 357 (17%), 378 (19%), and 1328 (64%) had HRL, M0 or M1 prostate cancer, respectively. The mean age at first diagnosis was similar in each group, 56% of all patients had extracapsular extension of their tumour, 28% had regional lymph node metastasis, and 53% had distant metastases. At enrolment, 62% of patients had at least one co-morbidity (mainly cardiovascular disease or diabetes), 91.8% of M1 patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of <2 and the mean EQ-5D-5L visual analogue score was 74.6-79.6 across cohorts. Treatment of M1 patients was primarily with combined androgen blockade (58%) or androgen-deprivation therapy (either orchidectomy or luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogues) (32%). Decisions to start therapy were mainly driven by treatment guidelines and disease progression. Decision to discontinue therapy was most often due to disease progression (hormonal drug therapy) or completion of therapy (chemotherapy).In the UFO registry of advanced prostate cancer in Asia, regional differences exist in prostate cancer treatment patterns that will be explored more deeply during the follow-up period; prospective follow-up is ongoing.

The adverse events (AEs) related to ALK inhibitors are fairly well known; notably, about 20% of patients receiving lorlatinib experienced cognitive effects and behavioral alterations in pivotal trials. Therefore, psychiatric disorders could represent AEs of special interest for all ALK TKIs, deserving careful assessment in the post-marketing setting.We conducted a real-world pharmacovigilance study on psychiatric AEs with marketed ALK inhibitors in subjects with advanced NSCLC.We performed an observational, retrospective analysis of spontaneous reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS, as of December 2020), selecting psychiatric AEs to ALK TKIs approved in NSCLC (crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib). These AEs were independently scrutinized by three oncologists applying predefined exclusion criteria, described in terms of clinical/demographic features and assessed for drug-related causality according to an adaptation of the WHO-UMC system, a standardized probabilistic algorithm.Among 584 reported psychiatric AEs, 95 cases were selected as potentially treatment related, with higher reporting frequency for lorlatinib (26, 2.8%), followed by brigatinib (10, 1.2%), alectinib (18, 0.7%), ceritinib (12, 0.6%), and crizotinib (29, 0.3%). Reported psychiatric symptoms were mood disorders (39), psychotic disorders (24), and anxiety, agitation, and irritability (25). In the majority (74%) of cases, psychiatric AEs were serious and required hospitalization in about 32% of patients; 15.8% of retained cases were considered as highly probable and 69.5% as probable. Drug discontinuation was recorded in 31.6% of the reported cases, with the highest proportion for lorlatinib (65.4%).Notwithstanding limitations, our study found a higher proportion of psychiatric AEs with lorlatinib, but also raised the hypothesis of psychiatric reactions as a class effect of ALK TKIs.© 2022.

However, no methods are practically available for measuring lymphedema-induced fibrosis before its deterioration. Technically, CT can visualize fibrosis in superficial and deep locations. For standardized measurement, verification of deep learning (DL)-based recognition was performed. A cross-sectional, observational cohort trial was conducted. After narrowing window width of the absorptive values in CT images, SegNet-based semantic segmentation model of every pixel into 5 classes (air, skin, muscle/water, fat, and fibrosis) was trained (65%), validated (15%), and tested (20%). Then, 4 indices were formulated and compared with the standardized circumference difference ratio (SCDR) and bioelectrical impedance (BEI) results. In total, 2138 CT images of 27 chronic unilateral lymphedema patients were analyzed. Regarding fibrosis segmentation, the mean boundary F1 score and accuracy were 0.868 and 0.776, respectively.

Low-risk patients treated with CCRT alone had longer DMFS than patients treated with additional chemotherapy to CCRT (P < 0.05).The proposed deep-learning model, based on MRI features and clinical variates, facilitated the prediction of DMFS in LANPC patients.3.4.© 2020 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.",2016M600145|China Postdoctoral Science Foundation|International|81571664|National Natural Science Foundation of China|International|81801665|National Natural Science Foundation of China|International|81871323|National Natural Science Foundation of China|International|2018B030311024|National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province|International|201707010328|Scientific Research General Project of Guangzhou Science Technology and Innovation Commission|International,11/08/2020,D016428;D016449;D013485,10.1002/jmri.27308,NA,0,0,,

Emerging data from observational studies have reported improved short- and medium-term allograft outcomes in recipients of paternal compared to maternal donors. The INCEPTION study aims to identify potential differences in immunological compatibility between maternal and paternal donor kidneys and ascertain how this affects kidney allograft outcomes in children and adolescents with kidney failure.This longitudinal observational study will recruit kidney transplant recipients aged ≤18 years who have received a parental donor kidney transplant across 4 countries (Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the Netherlands) between 1990 and 2020. High resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of both recipients and corresponding parental donors will be undertaken, to provide an in-depth assessment of immunological compatibility. The primary outcome is a composite of de novo donor-specific anti-HLA antibody (DSA), biopsy-proven acute rejection or allograft loss up to 60-months post-transplantation. Secondary outcomes are de novo DSA, biopsy-proven acute rejection, acute or chronic antibody mediated rejection or Chronic Allograft Damage Index (CADI) score of > 1 on allograft biopsy post-transplant, allograft function, proteinuria and allograft loss. Using principal component analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression modelling, we will determine the associations between defined sets of immunological and clinical parameters that may identify risk stratification for the primary and secondary outcome measures among young people accepting a parental donor kidney for transplantation. This study design will allow us to specifically investigate the relative importance of accepting a maternal compared to paternal donor, for families deciding on the best option for donation.The INCEPTION study findings will explore potentially differential immunological risks of maternal and paternal donor kidneys for transplantation among children and adolescents. Our study will provide the evidence base underpinning the selection of parental donor in order to achieve the best projected long-term kidney transplant and overall health outcomes for children and adolescents, a recognized vulnerable population.The INCEPTION study has been registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, with the trial registration number of ACTRN12620000911998 (14th September 2020).© 2021.

We searched Ovid Medline (1946-), EMBASE (1947-), Scopus (1960-), Cochrane Central, and ClinicalTrials.gov . The primary outcome was rate of large-for-gestational age (LGA) neonates. Secondary outcomes were clinically relevant outcomes for GDM that were selected a priori.Titles, abstracts, and manuscripts were screened, selected, and reviewed by the first two authors. Four RCTs (24,966 patients) and 13 observational studies (710,677 patients) were analyzed.Pooled relative risks (RRs) were calculated with 95% CIs using random-effects models and were plotted graphically with forest plots. Study heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran Q and Higgins I 2 tests. The quality of studies that met the inclusion criteria was evaluated with the Downs and Black checklist. Publication bias was assessed by using asymmetry of funnel plots and Harbord's test. There was no difference in the rate of LGA neonates (pooled RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.88-1.04) by testing strategy among RCTs, but patients who underwent one-step testing were more likely to be diagnosed with GDM (pooled RR 2.13; 95% CI 1.61-2.82) and treated with diabetes medications (pooled RR 2.24; 95% CI 1.21-4.15). One-step testing was associated with higher rates of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (pooled RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.00-1.26) and neonatal hypoglycemia (pooled RR 1.23; 95% CI 1.13-1.34). In analysis of high-quality RCTs and observational studies, one-step testing was associated with a lower rate of LGA neonates (pooled RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.95-0.98), but higher rates of GDM diagnosis, treatment, NICU admission, and neonatal hypoglycemia.Despite a significant increase in GDM diagnosis and treatment with one-step testing, there is no difference in rate of LGA neonates compared with two-step testing among RCTs.PROSPERO, CRD42021252703.Copyright © 2022 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

However, its mortality and related risk factors remain unclear. Herein, we conducted a nationwide multicenter real-world study of ICH in adult ITP patients. According to data from 27 centers in China from 2005 to 2020, the mortality rate from ICH was 33.80% (48/142) in ITP adults. We identified risk factors by logistic univariate and multivariate logistic regression for 30-day mortality in a training cohort of 107 patients as follows: intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), platelet count ≤10 × 109/L at ICH, a combination of serious infections, grade of preceding bleeding events, and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) level on admission. Accordingly, a prognostic model of 30-day mortality was developed based on the regression equation. Then, we evaluated the performance of the prognostic model through a bootstrap procedure for internal validation.

Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival, disease-specific survivals (DSS), and local control (LC) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, with subgroups compared using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards modeling for multivariable analysis. Maximally selected rank statistics determined the cut point for closest surgical resection margin based on LC.Data for 278 eligible patients were analyzed, with median follow-up of 38.5 months. Two-year and 5-year outcomes were 69.0% and 62.2% for LC, 71.8% and 49.8% for OS, 47.2% and 35.7% for disease-free survival, and 78.7% and 59.1% for disease-specific survivals. The most discriminating margin cut point was 1.0 mm; the 2-year LC was 80.9% above and 54.2% below or equal to 1.0 mm. Increasing age, current smoking, primary tumor classification, and narrow surgical margins (≤1.0 mm) were statistically significantly associated with lower OS. Hemorrhage with return to theater was seen in 8.1% (n = 22 of 272), and 30-day mortality was 1.8% (n = 5 of 272). At 1 year, 10.8% (n = 21 of 195) used tracheostomies, 33.8% (n = 66 of 195) used gastrostomies, and 66.3% (n = 53 of 80) had maintained or improved normalcy of diet scores.Data from international centers show TORS to treat head and neck cancers in previously irradiated fields yields favorable outcomes for LC and survival. Where feasible, TORS should be considered the preferred surgical treatment in the salvage setting.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

This study was conducted to delineate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) of different degree and establish a death prediction model. In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 523 COVID-19 cases discharged before February 20, 2020 in Henan Province, China, compared clinical data, screened for high-risk fatal factors, built a death prediction model and validated the model in 429 mild cases, six fatal cases discharged after February 16, 2020 from Henan and 14 cases from Wuhan. Out of the 523 cases, 429 were mild, 78 severe survivors, 16 non-survivors. The non-survivors with median age 71 were older and had more comorbidities than the mild and severe survivors. Non-survivors had a relatively delay in hospitalization, with higher white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, D-dimer, LDH, BNP, and PCT levels and lower proportion of eosinophils, lymphocytes and albumin. Discriminative models were constructed by using random forest with 16 non-survivors and 78 severe survivors. Age was the leading risk factors for poor prognosis, with AUC of 0.907 (95% CI 0.831-0.983). Mixed model constructed with combination of age, demographics, symptoms, and laboratory findings at admission had better performance (p = 0.021) with a generalized AUC of 0.9852 (95% CI 0.961-1). We chose 0.441 as death prediction threshold (with 0.85 sensitivity and 0.987 specificity) and validated the model in 429 mild cases, six fatal cases discharged after February 16, 2020 from Henan and 14 cases from Wuhan successfully.

The aims of this study are to prospectively investigate cardiovascular outcomes and risk factors for incident cardiovascular disease in a post-stroke cohort, and to externally validate, refine and expand current risk prediction models for cardiovascular and cardiovascular-related outcomes. The study sample size was based on the development of post-stroke risk prediction models for AF and was calculated as 1222 participants. The study design is a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study. Participants will be adult patients admitted for ischaemic stroke confirmed by stroke physician or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) confirmed by MRI. Routinely collected data will be used in addition to the completion of simple validated questionnaires by the participants. Follow-up will be undertaken 12-months from the date of admission to hospital, in addition to linkage to routinely collected follow-up hospitalisation and mortality data. The primary outcomes are cardiovascular outcomes (including incident AF, stroke, TIA and myocardial infarction) at 12-month follow-up, all-cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular causes, and incident cognitive impairment and dementia.

In this observational study, we aimed to unravel and validate markers of ataxic gait in real life by using wearable sensors.We assessed gait characteristics of 43 patients with degenerative cerebellar disease (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia [SARA] 9.4 ± 3.9) compared with 35 controls by 3 body-worn inertial sensors in 3 conditions: (1) laboratory-based walking; (2) supervised free walking; (3) real-life walking during everyday living (subgroup n = 21). Movement analysis focused on measures of spatiotemporal step variability and movement smoothness.A set of gait variability measures was identified that allowed us to consistently identify ataxic gait changes in all 3 conditions. Lateral step deviation and a compound measure of spatial step variability categorized patients vs controls with a discrimination accuracy of 0.86 in real life. Both were highly correlated with clinical ataxia severity (effect size ρ = 0.76). These measures allowed detecting group differences even for patients who differed only 1 point in the clinical SARAposture&gait subscore, with highest effect sizes for real-life walking (d = 0.67).We identified measures of ataxic gait that allowed us not only to capture the gait variability inherent in ataxic gait in real life, but also to demonstrate high sensitivity to small differences in disease severity, with the highest effect sizes in real-life walking. They thus represent promising candidates for motor markers for natural history and treatment trials in ecologically valid contexts.This study provides Class I evidence that a set of gait variability measures, even if accessed in real life, correlated with the clinical severity of ataxia in patients with degenerative cerebellar disease.© 2020 American Academy of Neurology.",NA,3/07/2020,D016428;D064888;D013485,10.1212/WNL.0000000000010176,NA,0,0,,

With an executive committee comprising representatives from all member networks, PERN plays a supportive and collaborative rather than governing role. The full impact of PERN's facilitation of international collaborative research, although somewhat difficult to quantify empirically, can be measured indirectly by the observed growth of the field, the nature of the increasingly challenging research questions now being addressed and the collective capacity to generate and implement new knowledge in treating acutely ill and injured children.Beginning as a pandemic response studying H1N1 influenza risk factors in children, PERN research has progressed to multiple observational studies and ongoing global randomised controlled trials (RCTs). As a recent example, PERN has developed sufficient network infrastructure to enable the rapid initiation of a prospective observational study in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic.Following its success with developing global research, the PERN goal now is to promote the implementation of scientific advances into everyday clinical practice by: (i) expanding the capacity for global RCTs; (ii) deepening the focus on implementation science; (iii) increasing attention to healthcare disparities; and (iv) expanding PERN's reach into resource-restricted regions. Through these actions, PERN aims to meet the needs of acutely ill and injured children throughout the world.© 2021 The Authors.

We aimed to estimate the incidence of endocrine disorders in transfusiondependent thalassemia (TDT) patients during long-term iron-chelation therapy with deferasirox (DFX). We developed a multi-center follow-up study of 426 TDT patients treated with once-daily DFX for a median duration of 8 years, up to 18.5 years. At baseline, 118, 121, and 187 patients had 0, 1, or ≥2 endocrine diseases respectively. 104 additional endocrine diseases were developed during the follow-up. The overall risk of developing a new endocrine complication within 5 years was 9.7% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 6.3-13.1). Multiple Cox regression analysis identified three key predictors: age showed a positive log-linear effect (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for 50% increase 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3, P=0.005), the serum concentration of thyrotropin showed a positive linear effect (adjusted HR for 1 mIU/L increase 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.4, P<0.001) regardless the kind of disease incident, while the number of previous endocrine diseases showed a negative linear effect: the higher the number of diseases at baseline the lower the chance of developing further diseasess (adjusted HR for unit increase 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4-0.7, P<0.001). Age and thyrotropin had similar effect sizes across the categories of baseline diseases. The administration of levothyroxine as a covariate did not change the estimates. Although in DFX-treated TDT patients the risk of developing an endocrine complication is generally lower than the previously reported risk, there is considerable risk variation and the burden of these complications remains high. We developed a simple risk score chart enabling clinicians to estimate their patients' risk.

We evaluated the extent of cardiac sequelae 6 months after hospital discharge in patients surviving ICU hospitalization for COVID-19.All survivors of Maastricht-ICU were invited for comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation 6 months after discharge from ICU. Cardiac screening included an electrocardiogram, cardiac biomarkers, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and, wherever indicated, cardiac computed tomography or coronary angiogram.Out of 52 survivors, 81% ( n  = 42) participated to the cardiovascular follow-up [median follow-up of 6 months, interquartile range (IQR) 6.1-6.7]. Eight patients (19%) had newly diagnosed coronary artery disease (CAD), of which two required a percutaneous intervention. Echocardiographic global longitudinal strain (GLS) was abnormal in 24% and CMR-derived GLS was abnormal in 12%, despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction in all. None of the patients showed elevated T 1 relaxation times and five patients (14%) had an elevated T 2 relaxation time. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) reflecting regional myocardial fibrosis was increased in eight patients (21%), of which three had myocarditis and three had pericarditis.Cardiovascular follow-up at 6 months after ICU-admission for severe COVID-19 revealed that one out of five invasively mechanically ventilated survivors had CAD, a quarter had subclinical left ventricular dysfunction defined as reduced echocardiographic GLS, and 42% of the patients had CMR abnormalities (reduced LVEF, reduced GLS, LGE presence, and elevated T 2 ). On the basis of these findings, long-term cardiovascular follow-up is strongly recommended in all post-IC COVID-19 patients.Trial Register number [NL8613]) https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/8613Video abstract:http://links.lww.com/HJH/B899 .Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, human assessment of cardiac function focuses on a limited sampling of cardiac cycles and has considerable inter-observer variability despite years of training4,5. Here, to overcome this challenge, we present a video-based deep learning algorithm-EchoNet-Dynamic-that surpasses the performance of human experts in the critical tasks of segmenting the left ventricle, estimating ejection fraction and assessing cardiomyopathy. Trained on echocardiogram videos, our model accurately segments the left ventricle with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.92, predicts ejection fraction with a mean absolute error of 4.1% and reliably classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (area under the curve of 0.97). In an external dataset from another healthcare system, EchoNet-Dynamic predicts the ejection fraction with a mean absolute error of 6.0% and classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with an area under the curve of 0.96. Prospective evaluation with repeated human measurements confirms that the model has variance that is comparable to or less than that of human experts. By leveraging information across multiple cardiac cycles, our model can rapidly identify subtle changes in ejection fraction, is more reproducible than human evaluation and lays the foundation for precise diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in real time.

BREATHE is a one-time shared decision-making intervention delivered by clinicians during routine office visits. Ten clinicians were randomized and trained on BREATHE or the control condition. Participants were followed monthly for 3 months post-intervention. Data were collected from December 2017 - May 2019 and included surveys, lung function tests, and interviews.Participants were Black/multiracial (100%) mostly female (83%) adults (mean age 45). BREATHE clinicians delivered BREATHE to all 40 participants with fidelity based on expert review of audiorecordings. While the control group reported improvements in asthma control at 1-month and 3-month follow-up, only BREATHE participants had better asthma control at each timepoint (β = 0.77; standard error (SE)[0.17]; p ≤ 0.0001; β = 0.71; SE[0.16]; p ≤ 0.0001; β = 0.54; SE[0.15]; p = .0004), exceeding the minimally important difference. BREATHE participants also perceived greater shared decision-making occurred during the intervention visit (β = 7.39; SE[3.51]; p = .03) and fewer symptoms at follow-up (e.g., fewer nights woken, less shortness of breath and less severity of symptoms) than the controls. Both groups reported improved adherence and fewer erroneous medication beliefs.BREATHE is a promising brief tailored intervention that can be integrated into office visits using clinicians as interventionists. Thus, BREATHE offers a pragmatic approach to improving asthma outcomes and shared decision-making in a health disparity population.The study addressed the important problem of uncontrolled asthma in a high-risk vulnerable population. Compared with the dose-matched attention control condition, participants receiving the novel brief tailored shared decision-making intervention had significant improvements in asthma outcomes and greater perceived engagement in shared decision-making. Brief interventions integrated into office visits and delivered by clinicians may offer a pragmatic approach to narrowing health disparity gaps. Future studies where other team members (e.g., office nurses, social workers) are trained in shared decision-making may address important implementation science challenges as it relates to adoption, maintenance, and dissemination.

The gut microbiota has been confirmed to play an important role in sepsis or cardiovascular diseases, but the changes and roles of the gut microbiota in SIMD have not been reported yet. This study aims to assess the compositions of the gut microbiota in sepsis or septic patients with or without myocardial injury and to find the relationship between the gut microbiota and SIMD.The prospective, observational, and 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted to observe gut microbiota profiles from patients with SIMD (n = 18) and matched non-SIMD (NSIMD) patients (n = 18) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Then the relationship between the relative abundance of microbial taxa and clinical indicators and clinical outcomes related to SIMD was analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predictive efficiencies of the varied gut microbiota to SIMD.SIMD was associated with poor outcomes in sepsis patients. The beta-diversity of the gut microbiota was significantly different between the SIMD patients and NSIMD subjects. The gut microbiota profiles in different levels significantly differed between the two groups. Additionally, the abundance of some microbes (Klebsiella variicola, Enterobacteriaceae, and Bacteroides vulgatus) was correlated with clinical indicators and clinical outcomes. Notably, ROC analysis indicated that K. variicola may be a potential biomarker of SIMD.Our study indicates that SIMD patients may have a particular gut microbiota signature and that the gut microbiota might be a potential diagnostic marker for evaluating the risk of developing SIMD.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Zhang, Ye, Hu, Yang, Yao, Zhao, Deng and Liu.",NA,5/04/2022,D016428;D064888;D013485,10.3389/fcimb.2022.857035,NA,1,1,,

Search items included 'adolescent idiopathic scoliosis', 'progression', and 'imaging'. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were carefully defined. Risk of bias of studies was assessed with the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool, and level of evidence for each predictor was rated with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. In all, 6,286 publications were identified with 3,598 being subjected to secondary scrutiny. Ultimately, 26 publications (25 datasets) were included in this review.For unbraced patients, high and moderate evidence was found for Cobb angle and curve type as predictors, respectively. Initial Cobb angle > 25° and thoracic curves were predictive of curve progression. For braced patients, flexibility < 28% and limited in-brace correction were factors predictive of progression with high and moderate evidence, respectively. Thoracic curves, high apical vertebral rotation, large rib vertebra angle difference, small rib vertebra angle on the convex side, and low pelvic tilt had weak evidence as predictors of curve progression.For curve progression, strong and consistent evidence is found for Cobb angle, curve type, flexibility, and correction rate. Cobb angle > 25° and flexibility < 28% are found to be important thresholds to guide clinical prognostication. Despite the low evidence, apical vertebral rotation, rib morphology, and pelvic tilt may be promising factors.

PD is also a heterogeneous disease with great variability in symptoms, disease course, and response to therapy. There is a general need for a better understanding of this heterogeneity and the interlinked long-term changes in brain function and structure in PD. Over the past years there is increasing interest in the value of new paradigms in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the potential of ultra-high field strength imaging in the diagnostic work-up of PD. With this multimodal 7 T MRI study, our objectives are: 1) To identify distinctive MRI characteristics in PD patients and to create a diagnostic tool based on these differences. 2) To correlate MRI characteristics to clinical phenotype, genetics and progression of symptoms. 3) To detect future imaging biomarkers for disease progression that could be valuable for the evaluation of new therapies.The TRACK-PD study is a longitudinal observational study in a cohort of 130 recently diagnosed (≤ 3 years after diagnosis) PD patients and 60 age-matched healthy controls (HC). A 7 T MRI of the brain will be performed at baseline and repeated after 2 and 4 years. Complete assessment of motor, cognitive, neuropsychiatric and autonomic symptoms will be performed at baseline and follow-up visits with wearable sensors, validated questionnaires and rating scales. At baseline a blood DNA sample will also be collected.This is the first longitudinal, observational, 7 T MRI study in PD patients. With this study, an important contribution can be made to the improvement of the current diagnostic process in PD. Moreover, this study will be able to provide valuable information related to the different clinical phenotypes of PD and their correlating MRI characteristics. The long-term aim of this study is to better understand PD and develop new biomarkers for disease progression which may help new therapy development. Eventually, this may lead to predictive models for individual PD patients and towards personalized medicine in the future.Dutch Trial Register, NL7558 .

We aimed to evaluate the detection of neovasculature during DSOC to distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic bile duct lesions.A retrospective, single-center, cohort study was used. Neovasculature was defined as the presence of irregular or ""spider"" vascularity on bile duct lesions. The accuracy of detection of neovasculature for the identification of neoplastic lesions was estimated using the histologic results, surgical specimens, and/or 6-month follow-up as the criterion standard. Interobserver agreement analysis (kappa value) was performed between 2 expert endoscopists and 3 nonexpert physicians.Ninety-five patients were included; the median age was 65.6 years (range, 20-93 years), and 51 (53.7%) patients were female. Signs of neovasculature were observed in 65 of 95 (68.4%) patients. Histology confirmed neoplasia in 48 of 95 (50.5%) patients, and 6-month follow-up survival confirmed neoplasia in 52 of 95 (54.7%) patients. The use of vascularity for identifying neoplastic lesions achieved an accuracy of 80%, sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 63%, positive predictive value of 75%, negative predictive value of 90%, positive likelihood ratio of 2.53 (95% confidence interval, 1.71-3.76), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.09 (95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.28).

The secondary aim was to develop and validate radiomics models for differentiating low-risk endometrial cancer from other endometrial cancers.This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study. From two participating centers, we identified consecutive patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometrial cancer who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination by an experienced examiner between 2016 and 2019. Patients recruited in Center 1 (Rome) were included as the training set and patients enrolled in Center 2 (Milan) formed the external validation set. Radiomics analysis (extraction of a high number of quantitative features from medical images) was applied to the ultrasound images. Clinical (including preoperative biopsy), ultrasound and radiomics features that were statistically significantly different in the high-risk group vs the other groups and in the low-risk group vs the other groups on univariate analysis in the training set were considered for multivariate analysis and for developing ultrasound-based machine-learning risk-prediction models. For discriminating between the high-risk group and the other groups, a random forest model from the radiomics features (radiomics model), a binary logistic regression model from clinical and ultrasound features (clinical-ultrasound model) and another binary logistic regression model from clinical, ultrasound and previously selected radiomics features (mixed model) were created. Similar models were created for discriminating between the low-risk group and the other groups. The models developed in the training set were tested in the validation set. The performance of the models in discriminating between the high-risk group and the other groups, and between the low-risk group and the other risk groups for both validation and training sets was compared.The training set comprised 396 patients and the validation set 102 patients. In the validation set, for predicting high-risk endometrial cancer, the radiomics model had an area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.80, sensitivity of 58.7% and specificity of 85.7% (using the optimal risk cut-off of 0.41); the clinical-ultrasound model had an AUC of 0.90, sensitivity of 80.4% and specificity of 83.9% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.32); and the mixed model had an AUC of 0.88, sensitivity of 67.3% and specificity of 91.0% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.42). For the prediction of low-risk endometrial cancer, the radiomics model had an AUC of 0.71, sensitivity of 65.0% and specificity of 64.5% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.38); the clinical-ultrasound model had an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 70.0% and specificity of 80.6% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.46); and the mixed model had an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 72.5% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.36).Radiomics seems to have some ability to discriminate between low-risk endometrial cancer and other endometrial cancers and better ability to discriminate between high-risk endometrial cancer and other endometrial cancers. However, the addition of radiomics features to the clinical-ultrasound models did not result in any notable increase in performance.

Patients aged > 18 years who were scheduled to undergo surgery for a suspicious pelvic mass had CA125 and HE4 levels measured prior to surgery, in addition to a routine transvaginal ultrasound scan. The diagnostic performance of CA125, HE4 and ROMA for distinguishing between benign and malignant adnexal masses was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC).Of 965 evaluable patients, 804 were diagnosed with benign tumors and 161 were diagnosed with ovarian cancer. In late-stage ovarian cancer, CA125, HE4 and ROMA all had an excellent diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.92), whereas in stage I and II, diagnostic performance of all three biomarkers was less adequate (AUC < 0.77). In the differential diagnosis of ovarian cancer and endometriosis, ROMA and HE4 performed better than CA125 with 99 and 98.1% versus 75.0% sensitivity, respectively, at 75.4% specificity.ROMA and HE4 could be valuable biomarkers to help with the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in premenopausal patients in order to differentiate from endometriosis, whereas CA125 may be more adequate for postmenopausal patients.© 2022.

The identification of potential symptoms has been reported to be a useful tool for clinical decision-making in emergency departments to avoid overload and improve the quality of care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of symptoms as a diagnostic tool for SARS -CoV-2 infection.An observational, cross-sectional, prospective and analytical study was carried out, during the period of time from April 14 to July 21, 2020. Data (demographic variables, medical history, respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms) were collected by emergency physicians. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The diagnostic accuracy of these characteristics for COVID-19 was evaluated by calculating the positive and negative likelihood ratios. A Mantel-Haenszel and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association of symptoms with COVID-19.A prevalence of 53.72% of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed. The symptom with the highest sensitivity was cough 71%, and a specificity of 52.68%. The symptomatological scale, constructed from 6 symptoms, obtained a sensitivity of 83.45% and a specificity of 32.86%, taking ≥2 symptoms as a cut-off point. The symptoms with the greatest association with SARS-CoV-2 were: anosmia odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95% CI; 2.52-4.17), fever OR 2.98 (95% CI; 2.47-3.58), dyspnea OR 2.9 (95% CI; 2.39-3.51]) and cough OR 2.73 (95% CI: 2.27-3.28).The combination of ≥2 symptoms / signs (fever, cough, anosmia, dyspnea and oxygen saturation < 93%, and headache) results in a highly sensitivity model for a quick and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, and should be used in the absence of ancillary diagnostic studies.

However, patients might experience vasculitis relapse, and no reliable predictors of CryoVas relapse after sustained virologic response (SVR) have been established. We aimed to describe HCV-CryoVas relapse rates and factors associated with it.An international multicenter cohort where patients with HCV-CryoVas from Egypt, France, and Italy treated with DAA were analyzed retrospectively. Factors associated with relapse-free survival were evaluated in a multivariate-adjusted model.Of 913 patients, 911 (99.8%) obtained SVR. After 35 months of the median follow-up, 798 patients (87.4%) had sustained remission of vasculitis, while 115 (12.6%) experienced CryoVas relapse. By the time of relapse, skin involvement was present in 100%, renal involvement in 85.2%, and peripheral neuropathy in 81.7%. Relapses were treated with glucocorticoids in 90.9%, associated with plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab in 50%, 37.3%, and 6.4%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of CryoVas relapse was 0.7% (95% CI 0.3-1.4), 12.3% (95% CI 10.2-14.6), and 13.1% (95% CI 11.0-15.5) at 12, 24, and 36 months after DAA treatment, respectively. Independent baseline risk factors associated with CryoVas relapse were male sex, skin ulcers, kidney involvement at baseline, and peripheral neuropathy at the end of DAA treatment. Death occurred in 11 relapsers, mainly due to infections.A substantial proportion of patients with CryoVas experience relapse after DAA-induced SVR.

Specifically, the prevalence and prognosis of ACLF in the context of AVB is unclear, while the role of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management in patients with ACLF has not been described to date.A multicenter, international, observational study was conducted in 2,138 patients from 34 centers between 2011 and 2015. ACLF was defined and graded according to the EASL-CLIF consortium definition. Placement of pre-emptive TIPS (pTIPS) was based on individual center policy. Patients were followed-up for 1 year, until death or liver transplantation. Cox regression and competing risk models (Gray's test) were used to identify independent predictors of rebleeding or mortality.At admission, 380/2,138 (17.8%) patients had ACLF according to EASL-CLIF criteria (grade 1: 38.7%; grade 2: 39.2%; grade 3: 22.1%). The 42-day rebleeding (19% vs. 10%; p <0.001) and mortality (47% vs. 10%; p <0.001) rates were higher in patients with ACLF and increased with ACLF grades. Of note, the presence of ACLF was independently associated with rebleeding and mortality. pTIPS placement improved survival in patients with ACLF at 42 days and 1 year. This effect was also observed in propensity score matching analysis of 66 patients with ACLF, of whom 44 received pTIPs and 22 did not.This large multicenter international real-life study identified ACLF at admission as an independent predictor of rebleeding and mortality in patients with AVB. Moreover, pTIPS was associated with improved survival in patients with ACLF and AVB.Acute variceal bleeding is a deadly complication of liver cirrhosis that results from severe portal hypertension. This study demonstrates that the presence of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is the strongest predictor of mortality in patients with acute variceal bleeding. Importantly, patients with ACLF and acute variceal (re)bleeding benefit from pre-emptive (early) placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.Copyright © 2020 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Diagnostic cardiovascular studies may be helpful for resource appropriation and identifying patients at increased risk for death. Methods and Results We analyzed 887 patients (aged 64±17 years) admitted with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 3, 2020 in New York City with 12 lead electrocardiography within 2 days of diagnosis. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory testing, including high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), were abstracted. At 30 days follow-up, 556 patients (63%) were living without requiring mechanical ventilation, 123 (14%) were living and required mechanical ventilation, and 203 (23%) had expired. Electrocardiography findings included atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in 46 (5%) and ST-T wave changes in 306 (38%). 27 (59%) patients with AF/AFL expired as compared to 181 (21%) of 841 with other non-life-threatening rhythms (P<0.001). Multivariable analysis incorporating age, comorbidities, AF/AFL, QRS abnormalities, and ST-T wave changes, and initial hs-cTnT ≥20 ng/L showed that increased age (HR 1.04/year), elevated hs-cTnT (HR 4.57), AF/AFL (HR 2.07), and a history of coronary artery disease (HR 1.56) and active cancer (HR 1.87) were associated with increased mortality.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate our initial experience with non-cultured, autologous skin cell suspension (ASCS) for the treatment of deep partial-thickness (DPT) facial burns. Patients were enrolled at a single burn center during a multicenter, prospective, single-arm, observational study involving the compassionate use of ASCS for the treatment of large total BSA (TBSA) burns. Treatment decisions concerning facial burns were made by the senior author. Facial burns were initially excised and treated with allograft. The timing of ASCS application was influenced by an individual's clinical status; however, all patients were treated within 30 days of injury. Outcomes included subjective cosmetic parameters and the number of reoperations within 3 months. Five patients (4 males, 1 female) were treated with ASCS for DPT facial burns. Age ranged from 2.1 to 40.7 years (mean 18.2 ± 17.3 years). Average follow-up was 231.2 ± 173.1 days (range 63-424 days). Two patients required reoperation for partial graft loss within 3 months in areas of full-thickness injury. There were no major complications and one superficial hematoma. Healing and cosmetic outcomes were equivalent to, and sometimes substantially better than, outcomes typical of split-thickness autografting. Non-cultured, ASCS was successfully used to treat DPT facial burns containing confluent dermis with remarkable cosmetic outcomes. Treatment of DPT burns with ASCS may be an alternative to current treatments, particularly in patients prone to dyspigmentation, scarring sequelae, and with limited donor sites.© The Author(s) 2020.

Despite extensive diagnostic workup, in only 25%-40% an underlying cause is identified. Several factors may increase the risk for miscarriage, but the chance of a successful pregnancy is still high. Prognostic counselling plays a significant role in supportive care. The main limitation in current prediction models is the lack of a sufficiently large cohort, adjustment for relevant risk factors, and separation between cumulative live birth rate and the success chance in the next conception. In this project, we aim to make an individualised prognosis for the future chance of pregnancy success, which could lead to improved well-being and the ability managing reproductive choices.In this multicentre study, we will include both a prospective and a retrospective cohort of at least 931 and 1000 couples with RPL, respectively. Couples who have visited one of the three participating university hospitals in the Netherlands for intake are eligible for the study participation, with a follow-up duration of 5 years. General medical and obstetric history and reports of pregnancies after the initial consultation will be collected. Multiple imputation will be performed to cope for missing data. A Cox proportional hazards model for time to pregnancy will be developed to estimate the cumulative chance of a live birth within 3 years after intake. To dynamically estimate the chance of an ongoing pregnancy, given the outcome of earlier pregnancies after intake, a logistic regression model will be developed.The Medical Ethical Research Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center approved this study protocol (N22.025). There are no risks or burden associated with this study. Participant written informed consent is required for both cohorts.

Among these, have been measures to control the pandemic in primary and secondary school settings.To assess the effectiveness of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the different types of measures implemented in school settings and the outcomes used to measure their impacts on transmission-related outcomes, healthcare utilisation outcomes, other health outcomes as well as societal, economic, and ecological outcomes.  SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on 9 December 2020. We conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews.We considered experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials; RCTs), quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome categories were (i) transmission-related outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of cases); (ii) healthcare utilisation outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of hospitalisations); (iii) other health outcomes (e.g. physical, social and mental health); and (iv) societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. costs, human resources and education). We considered studies that included any population at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and/or developing COVID-19 disease including students, teachers, other school staff, or members of the wider community.  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author extracted data and critically appraised each study. One additional review author validated the extracted data. To critically appraise included studies, we used the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental and observational studies, the QUADAS-2 tool for observational screening studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. Three review authors made an initial assessment of the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed and agreed on the ratings.We included 38 unique studies in the analysis, comprising 33 modelling studies, three observational studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental study with modelling components. Measures fell into four broad categories: (i) measures reducing the opportunity for contacts; (ii) measures making contacts safer; (iii) surveillance and response measures; and (iv) multicomponent measures. As comparators, we encountered the operation of schools with no measures in place, less intense measures in place, single versus multicomponent measures in place, or closure of schools. Across all intervention categories and all study designs, very low- to low-certainty evidence ratings limit our confidence in the findings. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the model structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. Across all categories, few studies reported on implementation or described how measures were implemented. Where we describe effects as 'positive', the direction of the point estimate of the effect favours the intervention(s); 'negative' effects do not favour the intervention.  We found 23 modelling studies assessing measures reducing the opportunity for contacts (i.e. alternating attendance, reduced class size). Most of these studies assessed transmission and healthcare utilisation outcomes, and all of these studies showed a reduction in transmission (e.g. a reduction in the number or proportion of cases, reproduction number) and healthcare utilisation (i.e. fewer hospitalisations) and mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 11 modelling studies and two observational studies assessing measures making contacts safer (i.e. mask wearing, cleaning, handwashing, ventilation). Five studies assessed the impact of combined measures to make contacts safer. They assessed transmission-related, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, and a reduction in hospitalisations; however, studies showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 13 modelling studies and one observational study assessing surveillance and response measures, including testing and isolation, and symptomatic screening and isolation. Twelve studies focused on mass testing and isolation measures, while two looked specifically at symptom-based screening and isolation. Outcomes included transmission, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed effects in favour of the intervention in terms of reductions in transmission and hospitalisations, however some showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. fewer number of days spent in school). We found three studies that reported outcomes relating to multicomponent measures, where it was not possible to disaggregate the effects of each individual intervention, including one modelling, one observational and one quasi-experimental study. These studies employed interventions, such as physical distancing, modification of school activities, testing, and exemption of high-risk students, using measures such as hand hygiene and mask wearing. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, however some showed mixed or no effects.   As the majority of studies included in the review were modelling studies, there was a lack of empirical, real-world data, which meant that there were very little data on the actual implementation of interventions.Our review suggests that a broad range of measures implemented in the school setting can have positive impacts on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and on healthcare utilisation outcomes related to COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence for most intervention-outcome combinations is very low, and the true effects of these measures are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Measures implemented in the school setting may limit the number or proportion of cases and deaths, and may delay the progression of the pandemic. However, they may also lead to negative unintended consequences, such as fewer days spent in school (beyond those intended by the intervention). Further, most studies assessed the effects of a combination of interventions, which could not be disentangled to estimate their specific effects. Studies assessing measures to reduce contacts and to make contacts safer consistently predicted positive effects on transmission and healthcare utilisation, but may reduce the number of days students spent at school. Studies assessing surveillance and response measures predicted reductions in hospitalisations and school days missed due to infection or quarantine, however, there was mixed evidence on resources needed for surveillance. Evidence on multicomponent measures was mixed, mostly due to comparators. The magnitude of effects depends on multiple factors. New studies published since the original search date might heavily influence the overall conclusions and interpretation of findings for this review.Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

However, the systems are based on the nonpregnant adult population. The aim of this study was to create a highly accurate scoring system that can be applied to pregnant women and to compare it to the most commonly used scores in general population and pregnant women. The creation and subsequent implementation of a highly accurate score system could shorten the diagnostic period and minimize the use of (ionizing) diagnostic imaging allowing the selection of the best treatment approach in pregnant patients with acute appendicitis. A single-center, retrospective cohort observational study was conducted at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia. Data were extracted from medical records of pregnant patients with suspected AA from January 2010 to December 2020. A total of 59 pregnant patients diagnosed with AA during pregnancy were identified, 41 were treated surgically, and 18 had non-surgical management. The main objective of our study was the detection of predictive factors of AA during pregnancy. Anorexia, pain migration to the right lower quadrant, rebound pain, axillary temperature over 37.3 °C, CRP/platelet ratio > 0.0422, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio > 7.182, and ultrasonic signs of AA were scored. Scoring in Appendicitis TriMOdal Score (ATMOS) consists of positive clinical parameter, each bringing 1 point and other parameters mentioned above that bring 2 points each. The score ranges from 0 to 10. Our model of ATMOS yields a high area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.963. The positive likelihood ratio is 9.97 (95% CI 2.64-38.00), and the negative likelihood ratio is 0.1 (95% CI 0.03-0.31), meaning that 94% of cases with ATMOS > 4 have AA, while less than 13% with an ATMOS ≤ 4 have the diagnosis of AA. The potential of ATMOS differentiating AA during pregnancy was demonstrated. Future prospective, randomized trials are needed to evaluate its accuracy and whether it should be used instead of Alvarado or Tzanakis scores in clinical decision-making.Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov-NCT05202483.

Methods. One hundred and twenty patients with suspected diagnosis of IBD were studied. They were randomly divided into control group (routine CT examination) and observation group (low-dose CTE examination based on improved GIF algorithm), with 60 cases in each group. Comprehensive diagnosis was used as the standard to assess the diagnostic effect. Results. (1) The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) (26.02 dB) and structural similarity (SSIM) (0.8921) of the algorithm were higher than those of GIF (17.22 dB/0.8491), weighted guided image filtering (WGIF) (23.78 dB/0.8489), and gradient domain guided image filtering (GGIF) (23.77 dB/0.7567) (P < 0.05); (2) the diagnostic sensitivity (91.49%), specificity (92.31%), accuracy (91.67%), positive predictive value (97.73%), and negative predictive value (75%) of the observation group were higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05); the sensitivity and specificity of CTE in the diagnosis of UD and CD were 96.77% and 81.25% and 98.33% and 93.33%, respectively (P < 0.05); there were significant differences in symmetrical intestinal wall thickening and smooth serosal surface between UD and CD (P < 0.05). Conclusion. (1) The improved GIF algorithm has a more effective application value in the denoising processing of low-dose CT images and can better improve the image quality; (2) the accuracy of CTE in the diagnosis of IBD is high, and CTE is of great value in the differential diagnosis of UD and CD.Copyright © 2022 Fangyun Jiang et al.",NA,15/04/2022,D016428;D016449,10.1155/2022/3871994,NA,1,1,,

The secondary aim was to develop and validate radiomics models for differentiating low-risk endometrial cancer from other endometrial cancers.This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study. From two participating centers, we identified consecutive patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometrial cancer who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination by an experienced examiner between 2016 and 2019. Patients recruited in Center 1 (Rome) were included as the training set and patients enrolled in Center 2 (Milan) formed the external validation set. Radiomics analysis (extraction of a high number of quantitative features from medical images) was applied to the ultrasound images. Clinical (including preoperative biopsy), ultrasound and radiomics features that were statistically significantly different in the high-risk group vs the other groups and in the low-risk group vs the other groups on univariate analysis in the training set were considered for multivariate analysis and for developing ultrasound-based machine-learning risk-prediction models. For discriminating between the high-risk group and the other groups, a random forest model from the radiomics features (radiomics model), a binary logistic regression model from clinical and ultrasound features (clinical-ultrasound model) and another binary logistic regression model from clinical, ultrasound and previously selected radiomics features (mixed model) were created. Similar models were created for discriminating between the low-risk group and the other groups. The models developed in the training set were tested in the validation set. The performance of the models in discriminating between the high-risk group and the other groups, and between the low-risk group and the other risk groups for both validation and training sets was compared.The training set comprised 396 patients and the validation set 102 patients. In the validation set, for predicting high-risk endometrial cancer, the radiomics model had an area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.80, sensitivity of 58.7% and specificity of 85.7% (using the optimal risk cut-off of 0.41); the clinical-ultrasound model had an AUC of 0.90, sensitivity of 80.4% and specificity of 83.9% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.32); and the mixed model had an AUC of 0.88, sensitivity of 67.3% and specificity of 91.0% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.42). For the prediction of low-risk endometrial cancer, the radiomics model had an AUC of 0.71, sensitivity of 65.0% and specificity of 64.5% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.38); the clinical-ultrasound model had an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 70.0% and specificity of 80.6% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.46); and the mixed model had an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 72.5% (using the optimal cut-off of 0.36).Radiomics seems to have some ability to discriminate between low-risk endometrial cancer and other endometrial cancers and better ability to discriminate between high-risk endometrial cancer and other endometrial cancers. However, the addition of radiomics features to the clinical-ultrasound models did not result in any notable increase in performance. Other efficacy studies and further effectiveness studies are needed to validate the performance of the models. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.© 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.",NA,30/10/2021,D016428;D016448;D064888,10.1002/uog.24805,NA,1,0,,

The analysis was conducted on data collected from the Intensive care units (ICU) at Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA and University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN and the Cerner® Health Facts Deidentified Database, a multi-site COVID-19 EMR database. The participants in the analysis consisted of adults over 18 years of age. Clinical data from 35,804 patients who developed ARDS and controls were used to generate predictive models that identify risk for ARDS onset up to 12-hours before satisfying the Berlin criteria. We identified salient features from the electronic medical record that predicted respiratory failure among this population. The machine learning algorithm which provided the best performance exhibited AUROC of 0.89 (95% CI = 0.88-0.90), sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI = 0.75-0.78), specificity 0.85 (95% CI = 085-0.86). Validation performance across two separate health systems (comprising 899 COVID-19 patients) exhibited AUROC of 0.82 (0.81-0.83) and 0.89 (0.87, 0.90). Important features for prediction of ARDS included minimum oxygen saturation (SpO2), standard deviation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), O2 flow, and maximum respiratory rate over an observational window of 16-hours. Analyzing the performance of the model across various cohorts indicates that the model performed best among a younger age group (18-40) (AUROC = 0.93 [0.92-0.94]), compared to an older age group (80+) (AUROC = 0.81 [0.81-0.82]). The model performance was comparable on both male and female groups, but performed significantly better on the severe ARDS group compared to the mild and moderate groups. The eARDS system demonstrated robust performance for predicting COVID19 patients who developed ARDS at least 12-hours before the Berlin clinical criteria, across two independent health systems.",TL1 TR002382|NCATS NIH HHS|United States|T32 GM095442|NIGMS NIH HHS|United States|2T32 GM095442|NIH HHS|United States|UL1 TR002378|NCATS NIH HHS|United States|K23 GM137182|NIGMS NIH HHS|United States,25/09/2021,D016430;D003160;D016428;D016448;D052061;D013486;D023361,10.1371/journal.pone.0257056,NA,0,0,,

After a full screening of the most discriminant structures between AD and normal aging based on MRI volumetric analysis of 3,032 subjects, we propose a novel Hippocampal-Amygdalo-Ventricular Atrophy score (HAVAs) based on normative lifespan models and AD lifespan models. During a validation on three external datasets on 1,039 subjects, our approach showed very accurate detection (AUC ≥ 94%) of patients with AD compared to control subjects and accurate discrimination (AUC = 78%) between progressive MCI and stable MCI (during a 3-year follow-up). Compared to normative modeling, classical machine learning methods and recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods, our method demonstrated better classification performance. Moreover, HAVAs simplicity makes it fully understandable and thus well-suited for clinical practice or future pharmaceutical trials.© 2022 The Authors.

Although there are multiple observational studies, there are few large, robust, randomized trials providing definitive effective approaches for the secondary prevention of AF. Given the increasing incidence and prevalence of AF nationally and internationally, the AF field needs transformative research and a commitment to evidenced-based secondary prevention strategies. We report on a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute virtual workshop directed at identifying knowledge gaps and research opportunities in the secondary prevention of AF. Once AF has been detected, lifestyle changes and novel models of care delivery may contribute to the prevention of AF recurrence, AF progression, and AF-related complications. Although benefits seen in small subgroups, cohort studies, and selected randomized trials are impressive, the widespread effectiveness of AF secondary prevention strategies remains unknown, calling for development of scalable interventions suitable for diverse populations and for identification of subpopulations who may particularly benefit from intensive management. We identified critical research questions for 6 topics relevant to the secondary prevention of AF: (1) weight loss; (2) alcohol intake, smoking cessation, and diet; (3) cardiac rehabilitation; (4) approaches to sleep disorders; (5) integrated, team-based care; and (6) nonanticoagulant pharmacotherapy.

However, its clinical efficacy is highly variable, and no reliable predictors exist to select patients who are likely to benefit from this drug.We analysed the molecular profiles and clinical outcomes of patients with pazopanib-treated sarcoma enrolled in a prospective observational study by the German Cancer Consortium, DKTK MASTER, that employs whole-genome/exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing to inform the care of young adults with advanced cancer across histology and patients with rare cancers.Among 109 patients with available whole-genome/exome sequencing data, there was no correlation between clinical parameters, specific genetic alterations or mutational signatures and clinical outcome. In contrast, the analysis of a subcohort of 62 patients who underwent molecular analysis before pazopanib treatment and had transcriptome sequencing data available showed that mRNA levels of NTRK3 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.53, p = 0.021), IGF1R (HR = 1.82, p = 0.027) and KDR (HR = 0.50, p = 0.011) were independently associated with progression-free survival (PFS). Based on the expression of these receptor tyrosine kinase genes, i.e. the features NTRK3-high, IGF1R-low and KDR-high, we developed a pazopanib efficacy predictor that stratified patients into three groups with significantly different PFS (p < 0.0001). Application of the pazopanib efficacy predictor to an independent cohort of patients with pazopanib-treated sarcoma from DKTK MASTER (n = 43) confirmed its potential to separate patient groups with significantly different PFS (p = 0.02), whereas no such association was observed in patients with sarcoma from DKTK MASTER (n = 97) or The Cancer Genome Atlas sarcoma cohort (n = 256) who were not treated with pazopanib.A score based on the combined expression of NTRK3, IGF1R and KDR allows the identification of patients with sarcoma and with good, intermediate and poor outcome following pazopanib therapy and warrants prospective investigation as a predictive tool to optimise the use of this drug in the clinic.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

However, acute DoC is rarely investigated, although identifying residual consciousness is key to clinical decision-making in the intensive care unit (ICU). Therefore, the objective of the prospective, observational, tertiary centre cohort, diagnostic phase IIb study 'Consciousness in neurocritical care cohort study using EEG and fMRI' (CONNECT-ME, NCT02644265) was to assess the accuracy of fMRI and EEG to identify residual consciousness in acute DoC in the ICU. Between April 2016 and November 2020, 87 acute DoC patients with traumatic or non-traumatic brain injury were examined with repeated clinical assessments, fMRI and EEG. Resting-state EEG and EEG with external stimulations were evaluated by visual analysis, spectral band analysis and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) consciousness classifier. In addition, within- and between-network resting-state connectivity for canonical resting-state fMRI networks was assessed. Next, we used EEG and fMRI data at study enrolment in two different machine-learning algorithms (Random Forest and SVM with a linear kernel) to distinguish patients in a minimally conscious state or better (≥MCS) from those in coma or unresponsive wakefulness state (≤UWS) at time of study enrolment and at ICU discharge (or before death). Prediction performances were assessed with area under the curve (AUC). Of 87 DoC patients (mean age, 50.0 ± 18 years, 43% female), 51 (59%) were ≤UWS and 36 (41%) were ≥ MCS at study enrolment. Thirty-one (36%) patients died in the ICU, including 28 who had life-sustaining therapy withdrawn. EEG and fMRI predicted consciousness levels at study enrolment and ICU discharge, with maximum AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI 0.77-0.80) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.77-0.80), respectively. Models based on combined EEG and fMRI features predicted consciousness levels at study enrolment and ICU discharge with maximum AUCs of 0.78 (95% CI 0.71-0.86) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.89), respectively, with improved positive predictive value and sensitivity. Overall, both machine-learning algorithms (SVM and Random Forest) performed equally well. In conclusion, we suggest that acute DoC prediction models in the ICU be based on a combination of fMRI and EEG features, regardless of the machine-learning algorithm used.© The Author(s) 2022.

Big Data in health care are defined as large datasets that are collected routinely or automatically, and stored electronically. With the rapidly expanding volume of health data collection, it is envisioned that the Big Data approach can improve not only individual health, but also the performance of health care systems. The application of Big Data analysis in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology research has also opened new research approaches. While it retains most of the advantages and avoids some of the disadvantages of traditional observational studies (case-control and prospective cohort studies), it allows for phenomapping of disease heterogeneity, enhancement of drug safety, as well as development of precision medicine, prediction models and personalized treatment. Unlike randomized controlled trials, it reflects the real-world situation and studies patients who are often under-represented in randomized controlled trials. However, residual and/or unmeasured confounding remains a major concern, which requires meticulous study design and various statistical adjustment methods. Other potential drawbacks include data validity, missing data, incomplete data capture due to the unavailability of diagnosis codes for certain clinical situations, and individual privacy.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of atosiban given before fresh embryo transfer on pregnancy outcomes of women with RIF.A prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial was performed in IVF center of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital. According to a computer-generated randomization list, 194 infertile women with RIF received fresh embryo transfer between July 2017 and December 2019 were randomly allocated into the atosiban (n = 97) and the placebo (n = 97) groups. Women in the treatment group received atosiban intravenously about 30 min before embryo transfer with a bolus dose of 6.75 mg over one minute. Those in the placebo group received only normal saline infusion for the same duration.There was no significant difference in the live birth rate between the atosiban and placebo groups (42.3% vs 35.1%, P = 0.302, RR = 1.206 (0.844-1.723)). No significant differences were found between the two groups in the positive pregnancy test, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and implantation rates. Similar results were found when stratified by the number of embryos previously transferred, number of previous failed embryo transfers, frequency of endometrial peristalsis on embryo transfer day (≥ 3 waves/min) or serum estradiol (E2) on the day of hCG above the median level. And, there was no correlation between the serum E2 level on the day of hCG and the frequency of endometrial peristalsis on embryo transfer day. The frequency of endometrial peristalsis on embryo transfer day, total FSH/HMG dosage and duration were the significant factors which independently predicted the likelihood of a live birth.These results suggested that atosiban treatment before fresh embryo transfer might not improve the live birth rate in RIF patients.The study had been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital (2017 ethics No.43) and was registered under Clinicaltrials.gov with an identifier NCT02893722.© 2022.

After extracting electronic medical record data, a set of 55 features (variables) was calculated and passed to the random forest algorithm to predict the onset of sepsis. Results: The pre-procedure clinical variables were used to build a prediction model from the training data set using the random forest machine learning method; a 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model. Finally, we tested the model using the validation data set. The area obtained by the model under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.91, the sensitivity was 87%, and the specificity was 89%. Conclusions: This newly established machine learning-based model has shown good predictive ability in Chinese sepsis patients. External validation studies are necessary to confirm the universality of our method in the population and treatment practice.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Li, Sun, Ding, Zhang, Liu, Han, Wang, Duan and Sun.",NA,2/11/2021,D016428;D064888;D016449;D013485,10.3389/fpubh.2021.754348,NA,1,0,,

We evaluated the incidence of cardiac complications including MINS across RCRI risk classes and the RCRI's ability to discriminate, before surgery, between patients who will experience these complications and those who will not.This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of 35,815 patients ≥ 45 years old who had elective inpatient noncardiac surgery from 2007 to 2013 at 28 centres in 14 countries. The primary outcome was a composite of MINS, myocardial infarction, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or cardiac death within 30 days after surgery. The secondary outcome was this composite without MINS.The primary outcome occurred in 4725 patients (13.2%); its incidences across RCRI classes I (no risk factors), II (1 risk factor), III (2 risk factors), and IV (≥ 3 risk factors) were, respectively, 8.2%, 15.4%, 26.6%, and 40.2% (C-statistic for discrimination 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.62-0.68]). The secondary outcome occurred in 1174 patients (3.3%) with incidences of 1.6%, 4.0%, 7.9%, and 12.9%, respectively (C-statistic 0.69 [0.65-0.72]). Thirty-five percent of primary outcome events and 26.9% of secondary outcome events occurred in patients with no RCRI risk factors.The RCRI alone is not sufficient to guide postoperative cardiac monitoring because 1 in 12 patients ≥ 45 years of age without any RCRI risk factors have a cardiac complication after major noncardiac surgery, and most of them would be missed without systematic troponin testing.Copyright © 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

Nonetheless, current guidelines continue to recommend the diagnosis of hypertension, when based on ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), rely, solely, on either the 24 h or ""daytime"" BP means. They also fail to recommend the time to treat patients. We conducted a systematic review of published human trials regarding ingestion-time differences in the effects of hypertension medications on asleep BP and sleep-time relative BP decline. Some 62 such trials published between 1992 and 2020, totaling 6120 hypertensive persons, evaluated 21 different single and 8 dual-fixed combination therapies.

After propensity score adjustment, baseline characteristics were well-balanced. Median follow-up was 26.0 months. After IPW-reweighting, overall survival was 43% vs. 36% at 5-years and 34% vs. 24% at 10-years, among those who did and did not receive AC, respectively (P < 0.01). In IPW-adjusted Cox regression models, AC was associated with improved all-cause mortality (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.63-0.81; P < 0.01).

Quantitative imaging features were extracted from contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted images (CE FS T1WI). Four classification methods, i.e., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression (LASSO-LR), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process (GP), and Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm, were compared for feature selection and radiomics signature construction. The predictive performance of the radiomics signatures was assessed with the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).Thirteen radiomics features selected based on the LASSO-LR classifier were adopted to construct the radiomics signature, which was significantly associated with the pathologic response. The prediction model achieved the best performance between good and poor responders with an AUC of 0.882 (95% CI, 0.837-0.918) in the primary cohort. Calibration curves showed good agreement. Similarly, findings were validated in the external validation cohort with good performance (AUC, 0.842 [95% CI, 0.793-0.883]) and good calibration. DCA analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the selected radiomics signature.The constructed CE FS T1WI-radiomics signature with excellent performance could provide a potential tool to predict pathologic response to NAC in patients with osteosarcoma.• The radiomics signature based on multicenter contrast-enhanced MRI was useful to predict response to NAC. • The prediction model obtained with the LASSO-LR classifier achieved the best performance. • The baseline clinical characteristics were not associated with response to NAC.© 2021.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), accounts for 70% of cases and has a 10-20-year preclinical period, when brain pathology covertly progresses before cognitive symptoms appear. The 2020 Lancet Commission estimates that 40% of dementia cases could be prevented by modifying lifestyle/medical risk factors. To optimise dementia prevention effectiveness, there is urgent need to identify individuals with preclinical AD for targeted risk reduction. Current preclinical AD tests are too invasive, specialist or costly for population-level assessments. We have developed a new online test, TAS Test, that assesses a range of motor-cognitive functions and has capacity to be delivered at significant scale. TAS Test combines two innovations: using hand movement analysis to detect preclinical AD, and computer-human interface technologies to enable robust 'self-testing' data collection. The aims are to validate TAS Test to [1] identify preclinical AD, and [2] predict risk of cognitive decline and AD dementia.Aim 1 will be addressed through a cross-sectional study of 500 cognitively healthy older adults, who will complete TAS Test items comprising measures of motor control, processing speed, attention, visuospatial ability, memory and language. TAS Test measures will be compared to a blood-based AD biomarker, phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181). Aim 2 will be addressed through a 5-year prospective cohort study of 10,000 older adults. Participants will complete TAS Test annually and subtests of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB) biennially. 300 participants will undergo in-person clinical assessments. We will use machine learning of motor-cognitive performance on TAS Test to develop an algorithm that classifies preclinical AD risk (p-tau181-defined) and determine the precision to prospectively estimate 5-year risks of cognitive decline and AD.This study will establish the precision of TAS Test to identify preclinical AD and estimate risk of cognitive decline and AD. If accurate, TAS Test will provide a low-cost, accessible enrichment strategy to pre-screen individuals for their likelihood of AD pathology prior to more expensive tests such as blood or imaging biomarkers. This would have wide applications in public health initiatives and clinical trials.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05194787 , 18 January 2022. Retrospectively registered.© 2022.

Post-LT graft function recovery assessment is also essential to aid physicians in the management of LT recipients and guide them through challenging decision making.This study aims to trial the use of indocyanine green clearance test (IGT) in the donor as an objective tool to assess graft viability and in the recipient to assess graft function recovery after LT.This is an observational prospective single-centre study on consecutive liver transplant donors and recipients.To determine the capability of IGT of predicting graft viability at the time of organ retrieval. Indocyanine green will be administered to the donor and the plasma disappearance rate (PDR) measured using the pulsidensitometric method. Some 162 IGT donor procedures will be required (α, 5%; β, 20%) using an IGT-PDR cut-off value of 13% to achieve a significant discrimination between viable and non-viable grafts.IGT-PDR will be measured at different time-points in the LT recipient: during the anhepatic phase, after graft reperfusion, at 24 hours, on day 3 and day 7 after LT.

This study aimed to explore the associations between deep learning signatures and biological functions as well as survival in (rNPC) patients.A total of 420 rNPC patients with PET/CT imaging and follow-up of overall survival (OS) were retrospectively enrolled. All patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 269) and test set (n = 151) with a 6:4 ratio. We constructed multi-modality deep learning signatures from PET and CT images with a light-weighted deep convolutional neural network EfficienetNet-lite0 and survival loss DeepSurvLoss. An integrated nomogram was constructed incorporating clinical factors and deep learning signatures from PET/CT. Clinical nomogram and single-modality deep learning nomograms were also built for comparison. Furthermore, the association between biological functions and survival risks generated from an integrated nomogram was analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).The C-index of the integrated nomogram incorporating age, rT-stage, and deep learning PET/CT signature was 0.741 (95% CI: 0.688-0.794) in the training set and 0.732 (95% CI: 0.679-0.785) in the test set. The nomogram stratified patients into two groups with high risk and low risk in both the training set and test set with hazard ratios (HR) of 4.56 (95% CI: 2.80-7.42, p < 0.001) and 4.05 (95% CI: 2.21-7.43, p < 0.001), respectively. The C-index of the integrated nomogram was significantly higher than the clinical nomogram and single-modality nomograms. When stratified by sex, N-stage, or EBV DNA, risk prediction of our integrated nomogram was valid in all patient subgroups. Further subgroup analysis showed that patients with a low-risk could benefit from surgery and re-irradiation, while there was no difference in survival rates between patients treated by chemotherapy in the high-risk and low-risk groups. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of data further explored the mechanism of high- and low-risk patients from the genetic and molecular level.Our study demonstrated that PET/CT-based deep learning signatures showed satisfactory prognostic predictive performance in rNPC patients. The nomogram incorporating deep learning signatures successfully divided patients into different risks and had great potential to guide individual treatment: patients with a low-risk were supposed to be treated with surgery and re-irradiation, while for high-risk patients, the application of palliative chemotherapy may be sufficient.© 2022.

Artificial intelligence has shown promise in endoscopy, but few cystoscopic applications have been reported. We report a Cystoscopy Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System (CAIDS) for BCa diagnosis.In total, 69 204 images from 10 729 consecutive patients from 6 hospitals were collected and divided into training, internal validation, and external validation sets. The CAIDS was built using a pyramid scene parsing network and transfer learning. A subset (n = 260) of the validation sets was used for a performance comparison between the CAIDS and urologists for complex lesion detection. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.The diagnostic accuracies of the CAIDS were 0.977 (95% CI = 0.974 to 0.979) in the internal validation set and 0.990 (95% CI = 0.979 to 0.996), 0.982 (95% CI = 0.974 to 0.988), 0.978 (95% CI = 0.959 to 0.989), and 0.991 (95% CI = 0.987 to 0.994) in different external validation sets. In the CAIDS vs urologists' comparisons, the CAIDS showed high accuracy and sensitivity (accuracy = 0.939, 95% CI = 0.902 to 0.964; sensitivity = 0.954, 95% CI = 0.902 to 0.983) with a short latency of 12 seconds, much more accurate and quicker than the expert urologists.The CAIDS achieved accurate BCa detection with a short latency. The CAIDS may provide many clinical benefits, from increasing the diagnostic accuracy for BCa, even for commonly misdiagnosed cases such as flat cancerous tissue (carcinoma in situ), to reducing the operation time for cystoscopy.© The Author(s) 2021.

Left atrial (LA) function might be tightly related to changes in patients' symptoms, more than morphological and anatomic heart features, measurable by ultrasound imaging technique. This study sought to investigate the correlation between LA function, assessed by Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (STE) and Quality of Life (QoL), assessed by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), in patients with chronic HF.Clinically stable HF outpatients (n = 369) were enrolled from 7 different international centres and underwent echocardiographic studies. Patients >75 years old and with atrial fibrillation were excluded. LA strain during reservoir phase (LASr) by STE was measured in all subjects by averaging the 6 atrial segments. LA size was assessed using biplane volume and 4-chamber area acquisition.LASr strongly correlated with both MLHFQ total score (r = -0.87; p < 0.0001). Less significant correlations between MLHFQ and either LA volume or left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) were found (r = 0.28; p = 0.05 and r = 0.30; p = 0.01, respectively).

However, the association in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of hypoalbuminemia using blood samples at admission in patients with aSAH.In a multicenter observational study of patients with aSAH, serum albumin counts were collected on admission. Hypoalbuminemia was defined as a total albumin level < 35 g/L. Multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score matching were performed to obtain the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary outcome of hospital-acquired infections.A total of 5448 patients were included in the observational cohort study. The odds of hospital-acquired infections were significantly higher in patients with albumin levels 30-34.9 g/L (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.38-1.90), 25-29.9 g/L (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.54-2.51), and < 24.9 g/L (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.53-3.86) compared with patients with albumin level ≥ 35 g/L.

These studies, however, have generally excluded difficult airways and rapid sequence intubation. In this study we looked to compare first-pass success (FPS) rates between VL and DL in adult emergency department (ED) patients with difficult airways.We conducted a secondary analysis of prospectively collected observational data in the National Emergency Airway Registry (NEAR) (January 2016-December 2018). Variables included demographics, indications, methods, medications, devices, difficult airway characteristics, success, and adverse events. We included adult ED patients intubated with VL or DL who had difficult airways identified by gestalt or anatomic predictors. We stratified VL by hyperangulated (HAVL) vs standard geometry VL (SGVL). The primary outcome was FPS, and the secondary outcome was comparison of adverse event rates between groups. Data analyses included descriptive statistics with cluster-adjusted 95% confidence intervals (CI).Of 18,123 total intubations, 12,853 had a predicted or identified anatomically difficult airway. The FPS for difficult airways was 89.1% (95% CI 85.9-92.3) with VL and 77.7% (95% CI 75.7-79.7) with DL (P <0.00001). The FPS rates were similar between VL subtypes for all difficult airway characteristics except airways with blood or vomit, where SGVL FPS (87.3%; 95% CI 85.8-88.8) was slightly better than HAVL FPS (82.4%; 95% CI, 80.3-84.4). Adverse event rates were similar except for esophageal intubations and vomiting, which were both less common in VL than DL. Esophageal intubations occurred in 0.4% (95% CI 0.1-0.7) of VL attempts and 1.5% (95% CI 1.1-1.9) of DL attempts. Vomiting occurred in 0.6% (95% CI 0.5-0.7) of VL attempts and 1.4% (95% CI 0.9-1.9) of DL attempts.Analysis of the NEAR database demonstrates higher first-pass success with VL compared to DL in patients with predicted or anatomically difficult airways, and reduced rate of esophageal intubations and vomiting.",NA,8/10/2022,D016428,10.5811/westjem.2022.6.55551,NA,1,1,,

Specifically, the prevalence and prognosis of ACLF in the context of AVB is unclear, while the role of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management in patients with ACLF has not been described to date.A multicenter, international, observational study was conducted in 2,138 patients from 34 centers between 2011 and 2015. ACLF was defined and graded according to the EASL-CLIF consortium definition. Placement of pre-emptive TIPS (pTIPS) was based on individual center policy. Patients were followed-up for 1 year, until death or liver transplantation. Cox regression and competing risk models (Gray's test) were used to identify independent predictors of rebleeding or mortality.At admission, 380/2,138 (17.8%) patients had ACLF according to EASL-CLIF criteria (grade 1: 38.7%; grade 2: 39.2%; grade 3: 22.1%). The 42-day rebleeding (19% vs. 10%; p <0.001) and mortality (47% vs. 10%; p <0.001) rates were higher in patients with ACLF and increased with ACLF grades. Of note, the presence of ACLF was independently associated with rebleeding and mortality. pTIPS placement improved survival in patients with ACLF at 42 days and 1 year. This effect was also observed in propensity score matching analysis of 66 patients with ACLF, of whom 44 received pTIPs and 22 did not.This large multicenter international real-life study identified ACLF at admission as an independent predictor of rebleeding and mortality in patients with AVB. Moreover, pTIPS was associated with improved survival in patients with ACLF and AVB.Acute variceal bleeding is a deadly complication of liver cirrhosis that results from severe portal hypertension. This study demonstrates that the presence of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is the strongest predictor of mortality in patients with acute variceal bleeding. Importantly, patients with ACLF and acute variceal (re)bleeding benefit from pre-emptive (early) placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.Copyright © 2020 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

This study aimed to identify the risk of using liberal oxygen therapy in patients with PQ poisoning. This was a multi-center retrospective cohort study involving four medical institutions in Taiwan. Data were extracted from the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) from January 2004 to December 2016. Patients confirmed to have PQ intoxication with a urine PQ concentration ≥ 5 ppm were analyzed. Patients who received oxygen therapy before marked hypoxia (SpO2 ≥ 90%) were defined as receiving liberal oxygen therapy. The association between mortality and patient demographics, blood paraquat concentration (ppm), and liberal oxygen therapy were analyzed. A total of 416 patients were enrolled. The mortality rate was higher in the liberal oxygen therapy group (87.8% vs. 73.7%, P = 0.007), especially in 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 4.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.533-14.471) and overall mortality (aOR: 5.97, 95% CI: 1.692-21.049) groups.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of EBMTs on NALFD in patients with obesity.Four databases were searched until Nov 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting liver-related outcomes following Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and non-FDA-approved EBMTs were included. Liver parameters, metabolic parameters, and weight loss were evaluated. Risk of bias was assessed using the ""risk of bias"" tool in the Cochrane Collaboration for RCTs and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies criteria for observational studies.Thirty-three studies with 1710 individuals were included. Regarding the effects of EBMTs on liver fibrosis, a significant decline of NAFLD Fibrosis Score, but not transient elastography-detected liver stiffness or Fibrosis-4 Index, was observed. EBMTs significantly improved liver steatosis (control attenuation parameter and Hepatic Steatosis Index), NAFLD Activity Score, and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance. EBMTs reduced serum levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase considerably. Moreover, EBMTs had reducing effects on the serum levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol as well as body weight.Our meta-analysis suggested that EBMTs could ameliorate NAFLD based on the evidence of improved liver steatosis, liver function, and insulin resistance. Large-scale, prospective, long-term studies are warranted to clarify the role of EBMTs in patients with different stages of NAFLD.Copyright © 2022 Ren, Zhou, Zhang, Mo, Yang, Yu and Ji.",NA,6/07/2022,D017418;D000078182,10.3389/fendo.2022.931519,NA,1,1,,

Effective preventive strategies are still scarce. The aim of the Oneplus trial was to test the hypothesis that the presence of a second midwife during the second stage of labour, with the purpose of preventing SPT, would result in fewer injuries affecting the anal sphincter than if attended by one midwife.In this multicentre, randomised, controlled parallel group, unmasked trial done at five obstetric units in Sweden, women were randomly assigned to be assisted by either one or two midwives in late second stage. Nulliparous women and women planning the first vaginal birth after caesarean section who were age 18-47 years were randomly assigned to an intervention when reaching the second stage of labour. Further inclusion criteria were gestational week 37+0, carrying a singleton live fetus in vertex presentation, and proficiency in either Swedish, English, Arabic, or Farsi. Exclusion criteria were a multiple pregnancy, intrauterine fetal demise, a planned caesarean section, or women who were less than 37 weeks pregnant. Randomisation to the intervention group of two midwives or standard care group of one midwife (1:1) was done using a computer-based program and treatment groups were allocated by use of sealed opaque envelopes. All women and midwives were aware of the group assignment, but the statistician from Clinical Studies Forum South, who did the analyses, was masked to group assignment. Midwives were instructed to implement existing prevention models and the second midwife was to assist on instruction of the primary midwife, when asked. Midwives were also instructed to complete case report forms detailing assistance techniques and perineal trauma prevention techniques. The primary outcome was the proportion of women who had SPT, for which odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated, and logistic regression was done to adjust for study site. All analyses were done according to intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT0377096.Between Dec 10, 2018, and March 21, 2020, 8866 women were assessed for eligibility, and 4264 met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. 3776 (88·5%) of 4264 women were randomly assigned to an intervention after reaching the second stage of labour. 1892 women were assigned to collegial assistance (two midwives) during the second stage of labour and 1884 women were assigned to standard care (one midwife). 13 women in each group did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded. After further exclusions, 1546 women spontaneously gave birth in the intervention group and 1513 in the standard care group. 1546 women in the intervention group and 1513 in the standard care group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome. There was a significant reduction in SPT in the intervention group (3·9% [61 of 1546] vs 5·7% [86 of 1513]; adjusted OR 0·69 (0·49-0·97).The presence of two midwives during the active second stage can reduce SPT in women giving birth for the first time.The Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare; Jan Hains Research Foundation; and Skane County Council's Research and Development Foundation.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study aimed to train a clinically applicable DLS for fundus diseases using data derived from the real world, and externally test the model using fundus photographs collected prospectively from the settings in which the model would most likely be adopted.In this national real-world evidence study, we trained a DLS, the Comprehensive AI Retinal Expert (CARE) system, to identify the 14 most common retinal abnormalities using 207 228 colour fundus photographs derived from 16 clinical settings with different disease distributions. CARE was internally validated using 21 867 photographs and externally tested using 18 136 photographs prospectively collected from 35 real-world settings across China where CARE might be adopted, including eight tertiary hospitals, six community hospitals, and 21 physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was further compared with that of 16 ophthalmologists and tested using datasets with non-Chinese ethnicities and previously unused camera types. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04213430, and is currently closed.The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the internal validation set was 0·955 (SD 0·046). AUC values in the external test set were 0·965 (0·035) in tertiary hospitals, 0·983 (0·031) in community hospitals, and 0·953 (0·042) in physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was similar to that of ophthalmologists. Large variations in sensitivity were observed among the ophthalmologists in different regions and with varying experience. The system retained strong identification performance when tested using the non-Chinese dataset (AUC 0·960, 95% CI 0·957-0·964 in referable diabetic retinopathy).Our DLS (CARE) showed satisfactory performance for screening multiple retinal abnormalities in real-world settings using prospectively collected fundus photographs, and so could allow the system to be implemented and adopted for clinical care.This study was funded by the National Key R&D Programme of China, the Science and Technology Planning Projects of Guangdong Province, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.For the Chinese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Carotid atherosclerosis is an established indicator of subclinical CVD. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between dietary ISF intake and subclinical CVD in middle-aged and elderly adults.A total of 873 subjects aged 40-70 years without CVD were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. A restricted cubic spline was used to investigate the association between ISF intake and subclinical CVD risk. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval of the risk of subclinical CVD for ISF were estimated by two-segmented logistic regression analysis. In Model 2, there was a non-linear association between ISF intake and the risk of subclinical CVD among women (Pnon-linear = 0.002), with an inverse association below the change point. The nadir for the risk of subclinical CVD among women was 7.26 mg/day (energy-adjusted). Below the change point, an increase of 1 mg ISF/day reduced the risk of subclinical CVD by 15%. There was no significant association between ISF intake and subclinical CVD risk above the change point (OR = 1.01 [0.99, 1.04]). ISF intake was not associated with subclinical CVD risk in men (Model 2: Pnon-linear = 0.224).Below the change point (7.26 mg/day), women with a higher intake of ISF had a significantly lower risk of subclinical CVD. Encouraging the consumption of ISF-rich foods may help to lower CVD risk in middle-aged and elderly women.This study is registered at http://www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR 1900022445).Copyright © 2021 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

However, some patients obtain little benefit and experience unnecessary toxicities from IC. We intended to develop a gene-expression signature that can identify beneficiaries of IC.We screened chemosensitivity-related genes by comparing gene-expression profiles of patients with short-term tumor response or nonresponse to IC (n = 95) using microarray analysis. Chemosensitivity-related genes were quantified by digital expression profiling in a training cohort (n = 342) to obtain a gene signature. We then validated this gene signature in the clinical trial cohort (n = 187) and an external independent cohort (n = 240). Tests of statistical significance are 2-sided.We identified 43 chemosensitivity-related genes associated with the short-term tumor response to IC. In the training cohort, a 6-gene signature was developed that was highly accurate at predicting the short-term tumor response to IC (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87, sensitivity = 87.5%, specificity = 75.6%). We further found that IC conferred failure-free survival benefits only in patients in the benefit group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.34 to 0.87; P = .01) and not on those in the no-benefit group (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.62 to 2.51; P = .53). In the clinical trial cohort, the 6-gene signature was also highly accurate at predicting the tumor response (AUC = 0.82, sensitivity = 87.5%, specificity = 71.8%) and indicated failure-free survival benefits. In the external independent cohort, similar results were observed.The 6-gene signature can help select beneficiaries of IC and lay a foundation for a more individualized therapeutic strategy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.© The Author(s) 2020.

Recently, the OPTIMIST trial found higher mortality rates in the subgroup of infants born at 25 to 26 weeks' gestational age (GA) who received surfactant treatment while spontaneously breathing.To analyze outcomes among LISA-exposed, highly vulnerable babies born at less than 27 weeks' GA within the large-scale observational cohort of the German Neonatal Network.In this cohort study of data from 68 tertiary level neonatal intensive care units in Germany of infants born between 22 weeks 0 days to 26 weeks 6 days of gestation between April 1, 2009, and December 31, 2020, short-term outcomes among infants receiving LISA vs infants not receiving LISA were compared.Use of LISA within the first 72 hours of life.The main outcomes were rates of LISA use, use of mechanical ventilation within the first 72 hours (considered failure of LISA), and association of LISA with outcomes, including death from all causes, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), death and BPD combined, pneumothorax, retinopathy of prematurity, intracerebral hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia. To address potential confounding factors, multivariate logistic regression models were used.A total of 6542 infants (3030 [46.3%] female and 3512 [53.7%] male; mean [SD] GA, 25.3 (1.1) weeks; mean [SD] birth weight, 715 [180] g) were analyzed; 2534 infants (38.7%) received LISA, which was most frequently given quasi-prophylactically during delivery room management.

Patients with FPTMC received treatment with curative intent and presented cure criteria 6 months after treatment. Recurrence rate and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed. Two groups were analyzed: group A (no tumor recurrence) vs. group B (tumor recurrence).Ninety-four patients were analyzed. During a mean follow-up of 73.3 ± 59.3 months, 13 recurrences of FPTMC (13.83%) were detected and mean DFS was 207.9 ± 11.5 months. There were multifocality in 56%, bilateral thyroid involvement in 30%, and vascular invasion in 7.5%; that is to say, they are tumors with histological factors of poor prognosis in a high percentage of cases. The main risk factors for recurrence obtained in the multivariate analysis were the tumor size (OR: 2.574, 95% CI 1.210-5.473; p = 0.014) and the assessment of the risk of recurrence of the American Thyroid Association (ATA), both intermediate risk versus low risk (OR: 125, 95% CI 10.638-1000; p < 0.001) and high risk versus low risk (OR: 45.454, 95% CI 5.405-333.333; p < 0.001).FPTMC has a recurrence rate higher than sporadic cases.

A 12 month follow-up HPV test was recommended in triaged women with a negative or low grade cytology result, with referral if they tested positive for any high risk HPV type at follow-up.Proportion of women who had attended for their first HPV screening test, tested positive, and were referred for colposcopy; and short term risk of detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or worse, CIN grade 3 or worse, or cancer.54.6% (n=3 507 281) of an estimated 6 428 677 eligible women aged 25-69 had undergone their first HPV test by the end of 2019. Among those attending for routine screening, positivity for HPV16/18 and for HPV types not 16/18 was, respectively, 2.0% and 6.6% in women aged 25-69 (n=3 045 844) and 2.2% and 13.3% in highly vaccinated cohorts of women aged 25-34 (n=768 362). Colposcopy referral (ages 25-69 years) was 3.5%, increasing to an estimated 6.2% after accounting for women who had not yet had a 12 month repeat test. Cervical cancer was detected in 0.98% (456/46 330) of women positive for HPV16/18 at baseline, including 0.32% (89/28 003) of women with HPV16/18 and negative cytology. Women with HPV types not 16/18 and negative or low grade cytology at both baseline and 12 months were at low risk of serious disease (3.4% CIN grade 3 or worse; 0.02% cancer; n=20 019) but estimated to account for 62.0% of referrals for this screening algorithm.Colposcopy referral thresholds need to consider underlying cancer risk; on this basis, women with HPV16/18 in the first round of HPV screening were found to be at higher risk regardless of cytology result, even in a previously well screened population. Women with HPV types not 16/18 and negative or low grade cytology showed a low risk of serious abnormalities but constitute most referrals and could be managed safely with two rounds of repeat HPV testing rather than one.

To unravel the clinical heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these patients, we designed the prospective observational Maastricht Intensive Care COVID cohort (MaastrICCht). We incorporated serial measurements that harbour aetiological, diagnostic and predictive information. The study aims to investigate the heterogeneity of the natural course of critically ill patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection.Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care with a SARS-CoV-2 infection will be included. We will collect clinical variables, vital parameters, laboratory variables, mechanical ventilator settings, chest electrical impedance tomography, ECGs, echocardiography as well as other imaging modalities to assess heterogeneity of the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in critically ill patients. The MaastrICCht is also designed to foster various other studies and registries and intends to create an open-source database for investigators. Therefore, a major part of the data collection is aligned with an existing national intensive care data registry and two international COVID-19 data collection initiatives. Additionally, we create a flexible design, so that additional measures can be added during the ongoing study based on new knowledge obtained from the rapidly growing body of evidence. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic requires the swift implementation of observational research to unravel heterogeneity of the natural course of the disease of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mechanically ventilated patients. Our study design is expected to enhance aetiological, diagnostic and prognostic understanding of the disease.

The combined model showed the highest performance in both training and validation groups for predicting DFS ([CI], 0.714, 0.729) and OS ([CI], 0.730, 0.712). DCA showed that the net benefit of the combined model and of the clinical model is significantly greater than that of the radiomics model alone at different threshold probabilities.We demonstrated that a combined predictive model based on MR Rad-S and clinical risk factors had better predictive efficacy than the radiomics models alone for patients with ESCC.• Magnetic resonance-based radiomics features combined with clinical risk factors can predict survival in patients with ESCC. • The radiomics nomogram can be used clinically to predict patient recurrence, DFS, and OS. • Magnetic resonance imaging is highly reproducible in visualizing lesions and contouring the whole tumor.© 2022.

Current large asthma datasets report parenteral therapy only.To identify the use and type of escalation of treatment in children presenting to hospital with acute severe asthma.Retrospective cohort study of children with an emergency department diagnosis of asthma or wheeze at 18 Australian and New Zealand hospitals. The main outcomes were use and type of escalation treatment (defined as any of intensive care unit admission, nebulised magnesium, respiratory support or parenteral bronchodilator treatment) and hospital length of stay (LOS).Of 14 029 children (median age 3 (IQR 1-3) years; 62.9% male), 1020 (7.3%, 95% CI 6.9% to 7.7%) had treatment escalation. Children with treatment escalation had a longer LOS (44.2 hours, IQR 27.3-63.2 hours) than children without escalation 6.7 hours, IQR 3.5-16.3 hours; p<0.001). The most common treatment escalations were respiratory support alone (400; 2.9%, 95% CI 2.6% to 3.1%), parenteral bronchodilator treatment alone (380; 2.7%, 95% CI 2.5% to 3.0%) and both respiratory support and parenteral bronchodilator treatment (209; 1.5%, 95% CI 1.3% to 1.7%). Respiratory support was predominantly nasal high-flow therapy (99.0%). The most common intravenous medication regimens were: magnesium alone (50.4%), magnesium and aminophylline (24.6%) and magnesium and salbutamol (10.0%).Overall, 7.3% children with acute severe asthma received some form of escalated treatment, with 4.2% receiving parenteral bronchodilators and 4.3% respiratory support.

This prespecified exploratory biomarker analysis aimed to evaluate potential prognostic or predictive factors and mechanisms of resistance to adjuvant targeted therapy.COMBI-AD is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial comparing dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily plus trametinib 2 mg orally once daily versus two matched placebos. Study participants were at least 18 years of age and underwent complete resection of stage IIIA (lymph node metastases >1 mm), IIIB, or IIIC cutaneous melanoma, per American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition criteria, with a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the two treatment groups by an interactive voice response system, stratified by mutation type and disease stage. Patients, physicians, and the investigators who analysed data were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was relapse-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to disease recurrence or death from any cause. Biomarker assessment was a prespecified exploratory outcome of the trial. We assessed intrinsic tumour genomic features by use of next-generation DNA sequencing and characteristics of the tumour microenvironment by use of a NanoString RNA assay, which might provide prognostic and predictive information. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01682083, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants.Between Jan 31, 2013, and Dec 11, 2014, 870 patients were enrolled in the trial. Median follow-up at data cutoff (April 30, 2018) was 44 months (IQR 38-49) in the dabrafenib plus trametinib group and 42 months (21-49) in the placebo group. Intrinsic tumour genomic features were assessed in 368 patients (DNA sequencing set) and tumour microenvironment characteristics were assessed in 507 patients (NanoString biomarker set). MAPK pathway genomic alterations at baseline did not affect treatment benefit or clinical outcome. An IFNγ gene expression signature higher than the median was prognostic for prolonged relapse-free survival in both treatment groups. Tumour mutational burden was independently prognostic for relapse-free survival in the placebo group (high TMB, top third; hazard ratio [HR] 0·56, 95% CI 0·37-0·85, p=0·0056), but not in the dabrafenib plus trametinib group (0·83, 95% CI 0·53-1·32, p=0·44). Patients with tumour mutational burden in the lower two terciles seem to derive a substantial long-term relapse-free survival benefit from targeted therapy (HR [versus placebo] 0·49, 95% CI 0·35-0·68, p<0·0001). However, patients with high tumour mutational burden seem to have a less pronounced benefit with targeted therapy (HR [versus placebo] 0·75, 95% CI 0·44-1·26, p=0·27), especially if they had an IFNγ signature lower than the median (HR 0·88 [95% CI 0·40-1·93], p=0·74).Tumour mutational burden alone or in combination with IFNγ gene expression signature or other markers for an adaptive immune response might be of relevance for identifying patients with stage III melanoma who might derive clinical benefit from targeted therapy.

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) obtained during invasive coronary angiography (ICA) has become the new reference standard for hemodynamic significance detection. Absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantification by means of dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) has high diagnostic and prognostic values. FFR is an invasive measure and as such cannot be applied broadly, while MBF quantification is commonly performed on standard vascular territories intermixing normal flow from normal regions with abnormal flow from abnormal regions and consequently limiting its diagnostic power.The aim of this study is to provide physicians with reliable software tools for the non-invasive assessment of lesion-specific physiological significance for the entire coronary tree by combining PET-derived absolute flow data and coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA)-derived anatomy and coronary centerlines.The dynamic PET/CTA myocardial blood flow assessment with fused imagery (DEMYSTIFY) study is an observational prospective clinical study to develop algorithms and software tools to fuse coronary anatomy data obtained from CTA with dPET data to non-invasively measure absolute MBF, myocardial flow reserve, and relative flow reserve across specific coronary lesions. Patients (N = 108) will be collected from 4 institutions (Emory University Hospital, USA; Chonnam National University Hospital, South Korea; Samsung Medical Center, South Korea; Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea). These results will be compared to those obtained invasively in the catheterization laboratory and to a relatively novel non-invasive technique to estimate FFR based on CTA and computational fluid dynamics.Success of these developments should lead to the following benefits: (1) eliminate unnecessary invasive coronary angiography in patients with no significant lesions, (2) avoid stenting physiologically insignificant lesions, (3) guide percutaneous coronary interventions process to the location of significant lesions, (4) provide a flow-color-coded 3D roadmap of the entire coronary tree to guide bypass surgery, and (5) use less radiation and lower the cost from unnecessary procedures.The DEMYSTIFY study has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with registration number NCT04221594.",R01 HL143350|NHLBI NIH HHS|United States,7/02/2020,D016428;D016448;D064888;D052061,10.1007/s12350-020-02052-0,NCT04221594,0,0,,

We collected blood samples for liquid biopsy at diagnosis, intermediate stage, and progressive disease. Tissue and liquid biopsies were examined using Cobas ® EGFR Mutation Test v2.Liquid biopsy detected EGFR mutations in 63.6% of the patients at diagnosis. The presence of metastasis in the extrathoracic, brain, and adrenal glands correlated positively with the detection of EGFR mutations. Patients with positive EGFR mutations at diagnosis had significantly shorter overall and progression-free survival than patients with negative EGFR mutations. Four of the 18 patients (22.2%) who reached progressive disease had positive EGFR T790M mutations. Three of 10 patients (30.0%) with progressive disease were positive and negative for T790M using tumor re-biopsy and liquid biopsy, respectively. The results of EGFR mutation by tissue re-biopsy were the same as those of liquid biopsy in the three patients who were positive for significant EGFR mutations but negative for the T790M mutation using liquid biopsy at progressing disease. Only two patients were positive for major EGFR mutations at intermediate levels.Liquid biopsy can be a prognostic factor in EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments at diagnosis.

Secondary outcomes included mortality, stroke, bleeding and adverse events.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Knowledge on 11 March 2019 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting treatment efficacy for NOAF in critically ill patients. Data were extracted, and quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Of 1406 studies identified, 16 remained after full-text screening including two RCTs. Study quality was generally low due to a lack of randomisation, absence of blinding and small cohorts. Amiodarone was the most commonly studied agent (10 studies), followed by beta-blockers (8), calcium channel blockers (6) and magnesium (3). Rates of successful rhythm control using amiodarone varied from 30.0% to 95.2%, beta-blockers from 31.8% to 92.3%, calcium channel blockers from 30.0% to 87.1% and magnesium from 55.2% to 77.8%. Adverse effects of treatment were rarely reported (five studies).The reported efficacy of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, magnesium and amiodarone for achieving rhythm control was highly varied. As there is currently significant variation in how NOAF is managed in critically ill patients, we recommend future research focuses on comparing the efficacy and safety of amiodarone, beta-blockers and magnesium.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) ResNet 18 and Pyradiomics were used to analyze gray-scale-ultrasonic images to predict the prognosis and degree of differentiation of HCC.This retrospective study enrolled 513 patients with HCC who underwent preoperative grayscale-ultrasonic imaging, and their clinical characteristics were observed. Patients were randomly divided into training (n = 413) and validation (n = 100) cohorts. CNN ResNet 18 and Pyradiomics were used to analyze ultrasonic images of HCC and peritumoral images to develop a prognostic and differentiation model. Clinical characteristics were integrated into the radiomics model and patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups. The predictive effect was evaluated using the C-index and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.The model combined with ResNet 18 and clinical characteristics achieved a good predictive ability.

Ultrasound parameters were assessed before treatment initiation, after 48 ± 24 h, and 6 ± 1 days. Treatment response was determined within 7 days by two outcome measures: 1] partial Mayo score reduction; 2] no administration of rescue therapy.Out of 69 recruited patients, 56 were included in the final analysis, with 37 responders. The colon segment with the highest baseline bowel wall thickness was analysed, being the sigmoid in all patients. There was no difference in baseline bowel wall thickness between responders and non-responders in the partial Mayo score outcome. At 48 ± 24 h, a significant difference between responders and non-responders was identified in both absolute bowel wall thickness [median 3.1 mm vs 4.9 mm; p <0.0001], absolute reduction [-1.9 mm vs -0.2 mm; p <0.001], and relative reduction [-35.9% vs -4.1%; p <0.0001].

In the multivariable analysis, a >20% reduction had the highest odds ratio (22.6 [4.2, 201.2]; p = 0.001) for determining response. Similar results were seen for the rescue therapy outcome.Changes in bowel wall thickness, after 48 ± 24 h following intravenous corticosteroid treatment in hospitalised patients with severe ulcerative colitis, identify responders with high accuracy and might be used as an early marker to guide accelerated rescue therapy.© The Author(s) 2022.

Physiological adaptations to pregnancy obscure early signs of sepsis and can result in delays in recognition and treatment. Identifying biomarkers that can reliably diagnose sepsis will reduce morbidity and mortality and antibiotic overuse. We have previously identified an immune-metabolic biomarker network comprising three pathways with a >99% accuracy for detecting bacterial neonatal sepsis. In this prospective study, we will describe physiological parameters and novel biomarkers in two cohorts-healthy pregnant women and pregnant women with suspected sepsis-with the aim of mapping pathophysiological drivers and evaluating predictive biomarkers for diagnosing maternal sepsis.Women aged over 18 with an ultrasound-confirmed pregnancy will be recruited to a pilot and two main study cohorts. The pilot will involve blood sample collection from 30 pregnant women undergoing an elective caesarean section. Cohort A will follow 100 healthy pregnant women throughout their pregnancy journey, with collection of blood samples from participants at routine time points in their pregnancy: week 12 'booking', week 28 and during labour. Cohort B will follow 100 pregnant women who present with suspected sepsis in pregnancy or labour and will have at least two blood samples taken during their care pathway. Study blood samples will be collected during routine clinical blood sampling. Detailed medical history and physiological parameters at the time of blood sampling will be recorded, along with the results of routine biochemical tests, including C reactive protein, lactate and white blood cell count. In addition, study blood samples will be processed and analysed for transcriptomic, lipidomic and metabolomic analyses and both qualitative and functional immunophenotyping.Ethical approval has been obtained from the Wales Research Ethics Committee 2 (SPON1752-19, 30 October 2019).NCT05023954.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Validation studies have mainly been performed in optimal settings in the young population.We aim to compare the yield of AF detection, compliance, and patient-based experience in an ambulatory elderly population by using intermittent electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings and continuous event recording simultaneously.The study participants were part of the STROKESTOP II study, a Swedish screening study for AF. All participants were 75/76 years of age, were clinically free of AF, and had N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptides levels ≥125 ng/L. AF screening was performed in parallel during a 2-week period, using a continuous event recording device (R-test 4; Novacor) and 30-second intermittent recordings using a handheld ECG device (Zenicor II) four times daily. Participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire with regard to compliance and ease of use of the devices.During continuous event recording, 6% (n = 15/269) were diagnosed with AF and intermittent ECG detected AF in 2% (n = 5/269) of the participants (P = .002). No new cases of AF were detected using intermittent ECG monitoring only, but some episodes were detected in parallel for patients. On a graded ordinal scale of 1 to 5, with 1 reflecting ""very easy to use"", continuous monitoring was graded 2 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1-3) compared to intermittent 1 (IQR: 1-1) (P < .001).Continuous event recording detected three times more AF compared to intermittent ECG in an elderly ambulatory population. Compliance and user-friendliness were rated higher for the intermittent ECG device.© 2020 The Authors.

Radiomics features were extracted from shear-wave elastography (SWE) and corresponding B-mode ultrasound (BMUS) images. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithms were used to select ALN status-related features. Proportional odds ordinal logistic regression was performed using the radiomics signature together with clinical data, and an ordinal nomogram was subsequently developed. We evaluated its performance using C-index and calibration.SWE signature, US-reported LN status, and molecular subtype were independent risk factors associated with ALN status. The nomogram based on these variables showed good discrimination in the training (overall C-index: 0.842; 95%CI, 0.773-0.879) and the validation set (overall C-index: 0.822; 95%CI, 0.765-0.838). For discriminating between disease-free axilla (N0) and any axillary metastasis (N + (≥ 1)), it achieved a C-index of 0.845 (95%CI, 0.777-0.914) for the training cohort and 0.817 (95%CI, 0.769-0.865) for the validation cohort. The tool could also discriminate between low (N + (1-2)) and heavy metastatic ALN burden (N + (≥ 3)), with a C-index of 0.827 (95%CI, 0.742-0.913) in the training cohort and 0.810 (95%CI, 0.755-0.864) in the validation cohort.The radiomics model shows favourable predictive ability for ALN staging in patients with early-stage breast cancer, which could provide incremental information for decision-making.• Radiomics analysis helps radiologists to evaluate the axillary lymph node status of breast cancer with accuracy. • This multicentre retrospective study showed that radiomics nomogram based on shear-wave elastography provides incremental information for risk stratification. • Treatment can be given with more precision based on the model.© 2021.

The Multicenter International Prospective Analysis (MIPA) study investigated this controversial issue.This observational study enrolled women aged 18-80 years with biopsy-proven breast cancer, who underwent MRI in addition to conventional imaging (mammography and/or breast ultrasonography) or conventional imaging alone before surgery as routine practice at 27 centers. Exclusion criteria included planned neoadjuvant therapy, pregnancy, personal history of any cancer, and distant metastases.Of 5896 analyzed patients, 2763 (46.9%) had conventional imaging only (noMRI group), and 3133 (53.1%) underwent MRI that was performed for diagnosis, screening, or unknown purposes in 692/3133 women (22.1%), with preoperative intent in 2441/3133 women (77.9%, MRI group). Patients in the MRI group were younger, had denser breasts, more cancers ≥ 20 mm, and a higher rate of invasive lobular histology than patients who underwent conventional imaging alone (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Mastectomy was planned based on conventional imaging in 22.4% (MRI group) versus 14.4% (noMRI group) (p < 0.001). The additional planned mastectomy rate in the MRI group was 11.3%. The overall performed first- plus second-line mastectomy rate was 36.3% (MRI group) versus 18.0% (noMRI group) (p < 0.001). In women receiving conserving surgery, MRI group had a significantly lower reoperation rate (8.5% versus 11.7%, p < 0.001).Clinicians requested breast MRI for women with a higher a priori probability of receiving mastectomy. MRI was associated with 11.3% more mastectomies, and with 3.2% fewer reoperations in the breast conservation subgroup.• In 19% of patients of the MIPA study, breast MRI was performed for screening or diagnostic purposes. • The current patient selection to preoperative breast MRI implies an 11% increase in mastectomies, counterbalanced by a 3% reduction of the reoperation rate. • Data from the MIPA study can support discussion in tumor boards when preoperative MRI is under consideration and should be shared with patients to achieve informed decision-making.© 2021.

A new deep learning method, temporal convolution network (TCN), makes it possible to deal with complex clinical time series data in ICU. We aimed to develop and validate it to predict mortality risk using time series data from MIMIC III dataset.A total of 21,139 records of ICU stays were analysed and 17 physiological variables from the MIMIC III dataset were used to predict mortality risk. Then we compared the model performance of the attention-based TCN with that of traditional artificial intelligence (AI) methods.The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUCROC) and area under precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) of attention-based TCN for predicting the mortality risk 48 h after ICU admission were 0.837 (0.824 -0.850) and 0.454, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of attention-based TCN were 67.1% and 82.6%, respectively, compared to the traditional AI method, which had a low sensitivity (< 50%).The attention-based TCN model achieved better performance in the prediction of mortality risk with time series data than traditional AI methods and conventional score-based models. The attention-based TCN mortality risk model has the potential for helping decision-making for critical patients.Data used for the prediction of mortality risk were extracted from the freely accessible MIMIC III dataset. The project was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA).

NCT03625349,NA,NA,NA,NA,35294784,0,NA,Reliability of the passive leg movement assessment of vascular function in men.,"What is the central question of this study? Use of the passive leg movement (PLM) test, a non-invasive assessment of microvascular function, is on the rise. However, PLM reliability in men has not been adequately investigated, nor has such reliability data, in men, been compared to the most commonly employed vascular function assessment, flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). What is the main finding and its importance? PLM is a reliable method to assess vascular function in men, and is comparable to values previously reported for PLM in women, and for FMD. Given the importance of vascular function as a predictor of cardiovascular disease risk, these data support the utility of PLM as a clinically relevant measurement.Although vascular function is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease risk, and therefore has significant prognostic value, there is currently not a single clinically accepted method of assessment. The passive leg movement (PLM) assessment predominantly reflects microvascular endothelium-dependent vasodilation and can identify decrements in vascular function with advancing age and pathology. Reliability of the PLM model was only recently determined in women, and has not been adequately investigated in men. Twenty healthy men (age: 27 ± 2 year) were studied on three separate experimental days, resulting in three within-day and three between-day trials. The hyperemic response to PLM was assessed with Doppler ultrasound, and expressed as the absolute peak in leg blood flow (LBFpeak ), change from baseline to peak (ΔLBFpeak ), absolute area under the curve (LBFAUC ), and change in AUC from baseline (ΔLBFAUC ). PLM-induced hyperemia yielded within-day coefficients of variation (CV) from 10.9 to 22.9%, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) from 0.82 to 0.90, standard error of the measurement (SEM) from 8.3 to 17.2%, and Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) from 0.56 to 0.81. Between-day assessments of PLM hyperemia resulted in CV from 14.4 to 25%, ICC from 0.75 to 0.87, SEM from 9.8 to 19.8%, and r from 0.46 to 0.75. Similar to previous reports in women, the hyperemic responses to PLM in men display moderate-to-high reliability, and are comparable to reliability data for brachial artery flow mediated vasodilation. These positive reliability findings further support the utility of PLM as a clinical measurement of vascular function and cardiovascular disease risk.© 2022 The Authors.

While primarily designed to rule out NSTE-ACS safely, these algorithms can also be used for rule in of NSTE-ACS in some patients. Still, in a substantial number of patients, these algorithms do not provide a conclusive work-up. These patients often present with an atypical clinical profile and low-range positive hs-troponin values without a characteristic rise or fall pattern. They represent a heterogeneous group of patients with various underlying conditions; only a fraction (30%-40%) will eventually be diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. Uncertainty exists about the optimal diagnostic strategy and their management depends on the clinical perspective of the treating physician ranging from direct discharge to admission for invasive coronary angiography. Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is a non-invasive test that has been shown to be safe, fast and reliable in the evaluation of coronary artery disease. In this study, we will determine the usefulness of CCTA in patients with acute chest pain and low-range positive hs-troponin values.A prospective, double-blind, observational, multicentre study conducted in the Netherlands. Patients aged 30-80 years presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain and a suspicion of NSTE-ACS, a normal or non-diagnostic ECG and low-range positive hs-troponins will be scheduled to undergo CCTA. The primary outcome is the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA for the diagnosis of NSTE-ACS at discharge, in terms of sensitivity and negative predictive value.This study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (registration number MEC-2017-506).

NCT04995640,NA,NA,NA,NA,33561198,0,NA,Implications of different definitions for aortic arch classification provided by contemporary guidelines on thoracic aortic repair.,"Contemporary guidelines on thoracic aortic repair provide inconsistent reporting standards for the definition of aortic arch classification in Types I, II and III. The different reported criteria cannot be used interchangeably, due to a very low level of concordance, and this finding has relevant implications for the comparisons between studies using different classifications, and between different datasets of multicentre trials, which are not consistently analyzed with the same criteria. Also, the reported definitions, which were originally proposed for predicting difficult carotid stenting and therefore were conceived for healthy aortic arches, can be influenced by the pathological derangements of the aortic wall, including aneurysms and dissections. In this respect, the Madhwal's classification, which is based on the diameter of the left common carotid artery, appears to be the more suitable one for aortic arch classification in patients with thoracic aortic disease because it provides relevant clinical information along with an adequate reproducibility.© The Author(s) 2021.

This prospective, observational cohort study will examine the ability of the Heart Attack Prevention Program for You (HAPPY) Hearts screening protocol, a series of non-invasive procedures to identify middle-aged and older women who are at an elevated risk for experiencing an adverse cardiovascular event in the 5-year period after screening. The predictive value of the HAPPY Hearts protocol will also be compared with the Framingham Risk Score to determine the sensitivity for estimating risk for an adverse cardiovascular outcome.One thousand women 55 years of age or older will be recruited to be screened by the HAPPY Hearts protocol. This involves the cardiovascular assessment of resting blood pressure, blood pressure response to 3 min of moderate intensity exercise and large and small arterial elasticity. The participants will be classified into risk categories based on these measures. The incidence of the following adverse cardiovascular outcomes will be assessed in the 5-year period after screening in both groups: ischaemic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary bypass surgery, congestive heart failure and new hypertension.Information gathered in this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented in a programme evaluation report to inform Manitoba Health and key stakeholders about the outcomes of the study.

NCT04407039,NA,NA,NA,NA,34098965,1,NA,Determining optimal clinical target volume margins in high-grade glioma based on microscopic tumor extension and magnetic resonance imaging.,"In this study, we performed a consecutive macropathologic analysis to assess microscopic extension (ME) in high-grade glioma (HGG) to determine appropriate clinical target volume (CTV) margins for radiotherapy.The study included HGG patients with tumors located in non-functional areas, and supratotal resection was performed. The ME distance from the edge of the tumor to the microscopic tumor cells surrounding brain tissue was measured. Associations between the extent of ME and clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated by multivariate linear regression (MVLR) analysis. An ME predictive model was developed based on the MVLR model.Between June 2017 and July 2019, 652 pathologic slides obtained from 30 HGG patients were analyzed. The mean ME distance was 1.70 cm (range, 0.63 to 2.87 cm). The MVLR analysis identified that pathologic grade, subventricular zone (SVZ) contact and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion status were independent variables predicting ME (all P < 0.05). A multivariable prediction model was developed as follows: YME = 0.672 + 0.513XGrade + 0.380XSVZ + 0.439XMGMT + 0.320XIDH + 0.333X1p/19q. The R-square value of goodness of fit was 0.780. The receiver operating characteristic curve proved that the area under the curve was 0.964 (P < 0.001).ME was heterogeneously distributed across different grades of gliomas according to the tumor location and molecular marker status, which indicated that CTV delineation should be individualized. The model could predict the ME of HGG, which may help clinicians determine the CTV for individual patients.

Labeling was performed by retina specialists from fundus examination, according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale. Three convolutional neural networks (ResNet50) were trained with a transfer-learning procedure for assessing gradability and identifying VTDR and RDR. External validation was performed on 4 datasets spanning different geographical regions.Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC); area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC); sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the DL system in gradability assessment; and detection of RDR and VTDR.For gradability assessment, the system achieved an AUROC of 0.923 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.892-0.947), sensitivity of 86.5% (95% CI, 77.6-92.8), and specificity of 82.1% (95% CI, 77.3-86.2) for the primary validation dataset, and >0.82 AUROCs, >79.6% sensitivity, and >70.4% specificity for the geographical external validation datasets.

Interventional meta-analyses were assessed separately.Results 156 meta-analyses of observational studies were included, investigating associations between adiposity and risk of 84 obstetric or gynaecological outcomes. Of the 144 meta-analyses that included cohort studies, only 11 (8%) had strong evidence for eight outcomes: adiposity was associated with a higher risk of endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, antenatal depression, total and emergency caesarean section, pre-eclampsia, fetal macrosomia, and low Apgar score. The summary effect estimates ranged from 1.21 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.29) for an association between a 0.1 unit increase in waist to hip ratio and risk endometrial cancer up to 4.14 (3.61 to 4.75) for risk of pre-eclampsia for BMI >35 compared with <25. Only three out of these eight outcomes were also assessed in meta-analyses of trials evaluating weight loss interventions. These interventions significantly reduced the risk of caesarean section and pre-eclampsia, whereas there was no evidence of association with fetal macrosomia.Conclusions Although the associations between adiposity and obstetric and gynaecological outcomes have been extensively studied, only a minority were considered strong and without hints of bias.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Two large randomized clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe conclusively demonstrate that annual low-dose chest CT (LDCT) scan screening reduces lung cancer mortality. Age and smoking are the chief risk factors tested in LDCT studies, but numerous risk prediction models that incorporate additional lung cancer risk factors have shown excellent performance. The studies of LDCT in asbestos-exposed populations shows favorable results but are variable in design and limited in size and generalizability. Outstanding questions include how to: (1) identify workers appropriate for screening, (2) organize screening programs, (3) inform and motivate people to screen, and (4) incorporate asbestos exposure into LDCT decision-making in clinical practice. Conclusion: Screening workers aged ≥50 years with a history of ≥5 years asbestos exposure (or fewer years given intense exposure) in combination with either (a) a history of smoking at least 10 pack-years with no limit on time since quitting, or (b) a history of asbestos-related fibrosis, chronic lung disease, family history of lung cancer, personal history of cancer, or exposure to multiple workplace lung carcinogens is a reasonable approach to LDCT eligibility, given current knowledge.

The Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red-Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES), a network of Spanish researchers to investigate in respiratory disease, commissioned the current proposal in response to the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) call.CIBERESUCICOVID is a multicenter, observational, prospective/retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Spanish ICUs. Several work packages were created, including study population and ICU data collection, follow-up, biomarkers and miRNAs, data management and quality.This study included 6102 consecutive patients admitted to 55 ICUs homogeneously distributed throughout Spain and the collection of blood samples from more than 1000 patients. We enrolled a large population of COVID-19 ICU-admitted patients including baseline characteristics, ICU and MV data, treatments complications, and outcomes. The in-hospital mortality was 31%, and 76% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. A 3-6 month and 1 year follow-up was performed. Few deaths after 1 year discharge were registered. Low anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody levels predict mortality in critical COVID-19. These antibodies contribute to prevent systemic dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. The severity of COVID-19 impacts the circulating miRNA profile. Plasma miRNA profiling emerges as a useful tool for risk-based patient stratification in critically ill COVID-19 patients.We present the methodology used in a large multicenter study sponsored by ISCIII to determine the short- and long-term outcomes in patients with COVID-19 admitted to more than 50 Spanish ICUs.Copyright © 2022.

NCT04460638,NA,NA,NA,NA,35710987,0,NA,Rapid evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants by analysis of genetic distance.,"Timely evaluation of the protective effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern is urgently needed to inform pandemic control planning. Based on 78 vaccine efficacy or effectiveness (VE) data from 49 studies and 1,984,241 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected from 31 regions, we analyzed the relationship between genetic distance (GD) of circulating viruses against the vaccine strain and VE against symptomatic infection. We found that the GD of the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is highly predictive of vaccine protection and accounted for 86.3% (P = 0.038) of the VE change in a vaccine platform-based mixed-effects model and 87.9% (P = 0.006) in a manufacturer-based model. We applied the VE-GD model to predict protection mediated by existing vaccines against new genetic variants and validated the results by published real-world and clinical trial data, finding high concordance of predicted VE with observed VE. We estimated the VE against the Delta variant to be 82.8% (95% prediction interval: 68.7-96.0) using the mRNA vaccine platform, closely matching the reported VE of 83.0% from an observational study. Among the four sublineages of Omicron, the predicted VE varied between 11.9% and 33.3%, with the highest VE predicted against BA.1 and the lowest against BA.2, using the mRNA vaccine platform. The VE-GD framework enables predictions of vaccine protection in real time and offers a rapid evaluation method against novel variants that may inform vaccine deployment and public health responses.© 2022.

Labeling was performed by retina specialists from fundus examination, according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale. Three convolutional neural networks (ResNet50) were trained with a transfer-learning procedure for assessing gradability and identifying VTDR and RDR. External validation was performed on 4 datasets spanning different geographical regions.Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC); area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC); sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the DL system in gradability assessment; and detection of RDR and VTDR.For gradability assessment, the system achieved an AUROC of 0.923 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.892-0.947), sensitivity of 86.5% (95% CI, 77.6-92.8), and specificity of 82.1% (95% CI, 77.3-86.2) for the primary validation dataset, and >0.82 AUROCs, >79.6% sensitivity, and >70.4% specificity for the geographical external validation datasets. For detecting RDR and VTDR, the AUROCs were 0.981 (95% CI, 0.977-0.984) and 0.966 (95% CI, 0.961-0.971), with sensitivities of 94.9% (95% CI, 92.3-97.9) and 87.2% (95% CI, 81.5-91.6), specificities of 95.1% (95% CI, 90.6-97.9) and 95.8% (95% CI, 93.3-97.6), and positive predictive values (PPVs) of 98.0% (95% CI, 96.1-99.0) and 91.1% (95% CI, 86.3-94.3) for the primary validation dataset, respectively. The AUROCs and accuracies for detecting both RDR and VTDR were >0.9% and >80%, respectively, for the geographical external validation datasets. The AUPRCs were >0.9, and sensitivities, specificities, and PPVs were >80% for the geographical external validation datasets for RDR and VTDR detection.The excellent performance achieved with this DL system for image quality assessment and detection of RDR and VTDR in UWF-SLO images highlights its potential as an efficient and effective diabetic retinopathy screening tool.Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

This study evaluated the association of genetic admixture and CVD in self-identified Hispanic women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).Data came from the WHI Observational Study and the Clinical Trial Components conducted among postmenopausal women. The CVD outcomes included coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The proportions of European (EUR), sub-Saharan African (AFR), and Amerindian (AMI) admixture were estimated using 92 ancestry-informative markers. Cox regression models were used to assess the relationship between genetic admixture and CVD adjusting for age, lifestyle risk factors, known risk factors, and neighborhood socioeconomic status.Among 5195 participants EUR ancestry was associated with a lower CHD risk after adjusting for age (HR 0.41, p = 0.02), and in the fully adjusted model (HR 0.40, p = 0.03). AFR ancestry was associated with a higher CHD risk after adjusting for age (HR 2.91, p = 0.03), but it only showed a trend in in the fully adjusted model (HR 2.46, p = 0.10). AMI ancestry was not statistically significantly associated with CHD and none of the genetic admixture proportions were statistically significantly associated with stroke (p > 0.05).EUR ancestry was associated with a lower risk of CHD in Hispanic women. This highlights the need to account for genetic admixture in future CVD studies to consider different heritage groups to understand the role that genetic, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and environmental factors contribute to CVD health disparities in Hispanic women.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The aim of this study is to explore main differences in the clinical response to CPAP treatment in OVS compared to OSA alone.Using prospective data from the French National Sleep Apnea Registry, we conducted an observational study among 6320 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA, available spirometry, and at least one follow-up visit under CPAP therapy.CPAP efficacy measured on the residual apnea-hypopnea index and median adherence were similar between OVS and OSA patients. In both groups, the overall burden of symptoms related to sleep apnea improved with CPAP treatment. In a multivariable model adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, adherence to treatment and residual apnea-hypopnea index, OVS was associated with higher odds for persistent morning headaches (OR: 1.37 [95% CI; 1.04; 1.79]; P = 0.02), morning tiredness (OR: 1.33 [95% CI: 1.12; 1.59]; P<0.01), daytime sleepiness (OR; 1.24 [95% CI: 1.4; 1.46]: P<0.01) and exertional dyspnea (OR: 1.26 [95% CI: 1.00;1.58]; P = 0.04) when compared with OSA alone.CPAP therapy was effective in normalizing the apnea-hypopnea index and significantly improved OSA-related symptoms, regardless of COPD status. CPAP should be offered to patients with OVS on a trial basis as a significant improvement in OSA-related symptoms can be expected, although the range of response may be less dramatic than in OSA alone.",NA,13/08/2021,D016428;D064888;D013485,10.1371/journal.pone.0256230,NA,NA,NA,,

Although a low LNY (less than 12) is associated with poorer outcome in some studies, its prognostic value is unclear in patients with early-stage colorectal or rectal cancer with a complete pathological response following neoadjuvant therapy. Lymph node ratio (LNR), which reflects the proportion of positive to total nodes obtained, may be more accurate in predicting outcome in stage III colorectal cancer. This study aimed to identify factors correlating with LNY and evaluate the prognostic role of LNY and LNR in colorectal cancer.An observational study was performed on patients with colorectal cancer treated at three hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, from January 2010 to March 2016. Association of LNY and LNR with clinical variables was analysed using linear regression. Disease-free (DFS) and overall (OS) survival were investigated with Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.Some 1585 resections were analysed. Median follow-up was 27·1 (range 0·1-71) months. Median LNY was 16 (range 0-86), and was lower for rectal cancers, decreased with increasing age, and increased with increasing stage. High LNY (12 or more) was associated with better DFS in colorectal cancer. Subgroup analysis indicated that low LNY was associated with poorer DFS and OS in stage III colonic cancer, but had no effect on DFS and OS in rectal cancer (stages I-III). Higher LNR was predictive of poorer DFS and OS.Low LNY (less than 12) was predictive of poor DFS in stage III colonic cancer, but was not a factor for stage I or II colonic disease or any rectal cancer. LNR was a predictive factor in DFS and OS in stage III colonic cancer, but influenced DFS only in rectal cancer.",NA,9/02/2019,D016428;D016448;D064888;D013485,10.1002/bjs5.96,NA,NA,NA,,
NCT04504890,NA,NA,NA,NA,35640787,0,NA,Methylphenidate remediates aberrant brain network dynamics in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A randomized controlled trial.,"Methylphenidate is a widely used first-line treatment for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but the underlying circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we investigate whether a single dose of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate can remediate attention deficits and aberrancies in functional circuit dynamics in cognitive control networks, which have been implicated in ADHD. In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover design, 27 children with ADHD were scanned twice with resting-state functional MRI and sustained attention was examined using a continuous performance task under methylphenidate and placebo conditions; 49 matched typically-developing (TD) children were scanned once for comparison. Dynamic time-varying cross-network interactions between the salience (SN), frontoparietal (FPN), and default mode (DMN) networks were examined in children with ADHD under both administration conditions and compared with TD children. Methylphenidate improved sustained attention on a continuous performance task in children with ADHD, when compared to the placebo condition. Children with ADHD under placebo showed aberrancies in dynamic time-varying cross-network interactions between the SN, FPN and DMN, which were remediated by methylphenidate. Multivariate classification analysis confirmed that methylphenidate remediates aberrant dynamic brain network interactions. Furthermore, dynamic time-varying network interactions under placebo conditions predicted individual differences in methylphenidate-induced improvements in sustained attention in children with ADHD. These findings suggest that a single dose of methylphenidate can remediate deficits in sustained attention and aberrant brain circuit dynamics in cognitive control circuits in children with ADHD. Findings identify a novel brain circuit mechanism underlying a first-line pharmacological treatment for ADHD, and may inform clinically useful biomarkers for evaluating treatment outcomes.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

However, data correlating resistance genotype with quantitative phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) are scarce.In a prospective multicentre observational study, 900 clinical M tuberculosis complex isolates were collected from adults with drug-resistant tuberculosis in five high-endemic tuberculosis settings around the world (Georgia, Moldova, Peru, South Africa, and Viet Nam) between Dec 5, 2014, and Dec 12, 2017. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and resulting binary phenotypic AST results for up to nine antituberculosis drugs were determined and correlated with resistance-conferring mutations identified by WGS.Considering WHO-endorsed critical concentrations as reference, WGS had high accuracy for prediction of resistance to isoniazid (sensitivity 98·8% [95% CI 98·5-99·0]; specificity 96·6% [95% CI 95·2-97·9]), levofloxacin (sensitivity 94·8% [93·3-97·6]; specificity 97·1% [96·7-97·6]), kanamycin (sensitivity 96·1% [95·4-96·8]; specificity 95·0% [94·4-95·7]), amikacin (sensitivity 97·2% [96·4-98·1]; specificity 98·6% [98·3-98·9]), and capreomycin (sensitivity 93·1% [90·0-96·3]; specificity 98·3% [98·0-98·7]). For rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, the specificity of resistance prediction was suboptimal (64·0% [61·0-67·1], 83·8% [81·0-86·5], and 40·1% [37·4-42·9], respectively). Specificity for rifampicin increased to 83·9% when borderline mutations with MICs overlapping with the critical concentration were excluded. Consequently, we highlighted mutations in M tuberculosis complex isolates that are often falsely identified as susceptible by phenotypic AST, and we identified potential novel resistance-conferring mutations.The combined analysis of mutations and quantitative phenotypes shows the potential of WGS to produce a refined interpretation of resistance, which is needed for individualised therapy, and eventually could allow differential drug dosing. However, variability of MIC data for some M tuberculosis complex isolates carrying identical mutations also reveals limitations of our understanding of the genotype and phenotype relationships (eg, including epistasis and strain genetic background).Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, German Centre for Infection Research, German Research Foundation, Excellence Cluster Precision Medicine of Inflammation (EXC 2167), and Leibniz ScienceCampus EvoLUNG.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

We first aimed to validate the BEST-J score at four hospitals not specialized in performing ESD and then aimed to identify other risk factors for post-ESD bleeding.We evaluated the incidence of post-ESD bleeding in 791 cases of early gastric cancer (EGC) between October 2013 and December 2020 as a retrospective, multi-center observational study conducted at four hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression models to examine the effect of independent variables on post-ESD bleeding firstly included ten possible factors raised by the BEST-J score and secondly included statistically significant (p < 0.01) in univariate analysis. The prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic analysis and the areas under the curve (AUC).The incidence of post-ESD bleeding was 4.8% (38/791, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4-6.5%). On multivariate analysis, the risk factors were P2Y12 receptor antagonist (odds ratio [OR]: 5.870, 95% CI 1.624-21.219), warfarin (8.382, 1.658-42.322), direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (8.980, 1.603-50.322), and tumor location in lower third of stomach (2.151, 1.012-4.571), respectively. When we categorized cases into low-risk by BEST-J score, intermediate-risk, high-risk, and very high-risk groups, the bleeding rates were 2.8%, 7.3%, 12.8%, and 19.0%, respectively. The AUC for our cohort was 0.713 (95% CI 0.625-0.802) for the BEST-J score. In the multivariate analysis in our cohort, the risks were age, body mass index, P2Y12 receptor antagonist, warfarin, DOAC, respectively.The BEST-J score is equally accurate in risk stratification of patients with EGC for post-ESD bleeding at non-specialized facilities for ESD as in specialized hospitals. BMI and age may be helpful additional risk factors at hospitals not specialized.© 2022.

However, current evidence is inconsistent, especially in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. This meta-analysis aims to identify whether CEC is impaired or altered by drug therapy in RA.The PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were browsed to identify studies on CEC in RA patients. The searches mainly focused on studies in human subjects that were published before November 14, 2020, without any language restrictions. The effect size was pooled by the standardized mean differences and mean differences (SMD & MD) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in a random or fixed effect model. Heterogeneity across the studies was tested using Cochran's Q test and I2 statistic. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Downs and Black scale (D&B) were applied to evaluate the quality of included studies. The GRADE-system with its 4-grade evidence scale was used to assess the quality of evidence.A total of 11 eligible articles, including 6 observational and 5 interventional studies, were retrieved. The pooled results showed that in patients with RA, CEC was not significantly different than in healthy controls (SMD: -0.34, 95% CI: - 0.83 to 0.14), whereas the plasma HDL-C levels was significantly lower (MD: -3.91, 95% CI: - 7.15 to - 0.68). Furthermore, in the before-after studies, the CEC of RA patients (SMD: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.37) increased, but the plasma HDL-C levels (MD: 3.63, 95% CI: - 0.13 to 7.39) remained at a comparable quantity after anti-rheumatic treatment comparing with the baseline. In addition, the funnel plot of included studies displayed a lightly asymmetry, while Egger's and Begg's test did not suggest the existence of publication bias. The quality of evidence was rated according to GRADE as moderate to very low.The current meta-analysis demonstrated that HDL-mediated CEC can be improved by the early control of inflammation and anti-rheumatic treatment in RA patients, which is independent of the plasma HDL-C levels. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of low-quality and limited quantity of evidence. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether therapeutic strategies to enhance CEC in RA patients have beneficial effects for preventing CVD.",No.81903294|National Natural Science Foundation of China||No. A2018342|Medical Science and Technology Foundation of Guangdong Province||NO. 2018030310412|Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities||NO. 2018030310412|Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province||No. 21617352|Jinan University|,23/02/2021,D016428;D017418,10.1186/s12944-021-01444-6,NA,NA,NA,,

Asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 from nursing facility staff and residents is a major accelerator of infection. Facility-wide point-prevalence testing is an emerging strategy in disease mitigation. Because time is not available to await the results of randomized controlled trials before implementing strategies in this high-risk setting, an expert Delphi panel composed of experienced long-term care medicine professionals has now met to provide testing guidance for SARS-Coronavirus-2 to NFs. After many email and telephone discussions, the panel responded to a questionnaire that included six different scenarios, based on varying availability of Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing and personal protective equipment (PPE). The panel endorsed facility-wide testing of staff and residents without dissent when diagnostic RT-PCR was available. While the panel recognized the limitations of RT-PCR testing, it strongly recommended this testing for both staff and residents in NFs that were either COVID-19 naive or had limited outbreaks. There was also consensus on testing residents with atypical symptoms in a scenario of limited testing capability. The panel favored testing every 1 to 2 weeks if testing was readily available, reducing the frequency to every month as community prevalence declined or as the collection of additional data further informed clinical critical thinking and decision-making. The panel recognized that frequent testing would have consequences in terms of potential staff shortages due to quarantine after positive tests and increased PPE use. However, the panel felt that not testing would allow new clusters of infection to form. The resulting high mortality rate would outweigh the potential negative consequences of testing. The panel also recognized the pandemic as a rapidly evolving crisis, and that new science and increasing experience might require an updating of its recommendations. The panel hopes that its recommendations will be of value to the long-term care industry and to policy makers as we work together to manage through this challenging and stressful time.",NA,9/06/2020,D016428,10.1007/s12603-020-1401-9,NA,NA,NA,,
NCT04933890,NA,NA,NA,NA,35239105,0,NA,Global Longitudinal Strain Monitoring to Guide Cardioprotective Medications During Anthracycline Treatment.,"Anthracycline chemotherapy carries a risk of myocardial dysfunction and heart failure even at relatively low doses, and the clinical prediction of cancer treatment-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is inexact. Careful imaging or biomarker surveillance during chemotherapy can identify CTRCD before the development of heart failure. Currently, this surveillance is performed using ejection fraction (EF). While this is a reliable and reproducible test with three-dimensional techniques, the most widely used imaging technique is two-dimensional echocardiography, for which EF measurements have broad confidence intervals.The use of global myocardial strain (GLS) provides a more reliable and reproducible means of assessing global cardiac function and shows meaningful changes before a significant change of EF. Observational studies have shown that although absolute measurements of GLS, both at baseline and during therapy, are predictive of CTRCD risk, the most reliable approach is to assess the change of GLS with therapy - a meaningful relative change of 10-15% being significant. A clinical trial comparing GLS to EF surveillance did not show a significant change of EF in the overall study group, but did show that patients managed with a the GLS-guided approach were less likely to develop a meaningful change of cardiac function to an abnormal level. In at-risk patients, there is good evidence for the protective value of neurohormonal antagonists and statins: the use of GLS enables these benefits to be directed to those most likely to benefit, while minimizing their use in the majority of people, who do not need them. Although GLS requires an element of training and efforts to ensure uniformity, it has proven to be a feasible, robust, and reproducible technique, ready for wide adoption.© 2022.

Oral anticoagulation can reduce stroke risk but is limited by complication risk and non-compliance. Left atrial appendage exclusion (LAAE) is a new surgical option to reduce stroke risk in AF. The study objective was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of standalone thoracoscopic LAAE in high stroke risk AF patients.This was a retrospective, multicentre study of high stroke risk AF patients who had oral anticoagulation contraindications and were not candidates for ablation nor other cardiac surgery. Standalone thoracoscopic LAAE was performed using 3 unilateral ports access and epicardial clip. Periprocedural adverse events, long-term observational clinical outcomes and stroke rate were evaluated.Procedural success was 99.4% (174/175 patients). Pleural effusion occurred in 4 (2.3%) patients; other periprocedural complications were <1% each. One perioperative haemorrhagic stroke occurred (0.6%). No phrenic nerve palsy or cardiac tamponade occurred. Predicted annual ischaemic stroke rate of 4.8/100 patient-years (based on median CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4.0) was significantly higher than stroke risk observed in follow-up after LAAE. No ischaemic strokes occurred (median follow-up: 12.5 months), resulting in observed rate of 0 (95% CI 0-2.0)/100 patient-years (P < 0.001 versus predicted). Six all-cause (non-device-related) deaths occurred during follow-up.Study proved that a new surgical option, standalone thoracoscopic LAAE, is feasible and safe. With this method, long-term stroke rate may be reduced compared to predicted for high-risk AF population.© The Author(s) 2021.

Non-contact infrared thermometers could reduce both the distress of the child and the risk of cross-infection.The objective of this study was to compare the use of non-contact thermometers with the use of electronic axillary and infrared tympanic thermometers in children presenting to primary care.Method comparison study with a nested qualitative study.Primary care in Oxfordshire.Children aged ≤ 5 years attending with an acute illness.Two types of non-contact infrared thermometers [i.e. Thermofocus (Tecnimed, Varese, Italy) and Firhealth (Firhealth, Shenzhen, China)] were compared with an electronic axillary thermometer and an infrared tympanic thermometer.The primary outcome was agreement between the Thermofocus non-contact infrared thermometer and the axillary thermometer. Secondary outcomes included agreement between all other sets of thermometers, diagnostic accuracy for detecting fever, parental and child ratings of acceptability and discomfort, and themes arising from our qualitative interviews with parents.A total of 401 children (203 boys) were recruited, with a median age of 1.6 years (interquartile range 0.79-3.38 years). The readings of the Thermofocus non-contact infrared thermometer differed from those of the axillary thermometer by -0.14 °C (95% confidence interval -0.21 to -0.06 °C) on average with the lower limit of agreement being -1.57 °C (95% confidence interval -1.69 to -1.44 °C) and the upper limit being 1.29 °C (95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.42 °C). The readings of the Firhealth non-contact infrared thermometer differed from those of the axillary thermometer by -0.16 °C (95% confidence interval -0.23 to -0.09 °C) on average, with the lower limit of agreement being -1.54 °C (95% confidence interval -1.66 to -1.41 °C) and the upper limit being 1.22 °C (95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.34 °C). The difference between the first and second readings of the Thermofocus was -0.04 °C (95% confidence interval -0.07 to -0.01 °C); the lower limit was -0.56 °C (95% confidence interval -0.60 to -0.51 °C) and the upper limit was 0.47 °C (95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.52 °C). The difference between the first and second readings of the Firhealth thermometer was 0.01 °C (95% confidence interval -0.02 to 0.04 °C); the lower limit was -0.60 °C (95% confidence interval -0.65 to -0.54 °C) and the upper limit was 0.61 °C (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 0.67 °C). Sensitivity and specificity for the Thermofocus non-contact infrared thermometer were 66.7% (95% confidence interval 38.4% to 88.2%) and 98.0% (95% confidence interval 96.0% to 99.2%), respectively. For the Firhealth non-contact infrared thermometer, sensitivity was 12.5% (95% confidence interval 1.6% to 38.3%) and specificity was 99.4% (95% confidence interval 98.0% to 99.9%). The majority of parents found all methods to be acceptable, although discomfort ratings were highest for the axillary thermometer. The non-contact thermometers required fewer readings than the comparator thermometers.A method comparison study does not compare new methods against a reference standard, which in this case would be central thermometry requiring the placement of a central line, which is not feasible or acceptable in primary care. Electronic axillary and infrared tympanic thermometers have been found to have moderate agreement themselves with central temperature measurements.The 95% limits of agreement are > 1 °C for both non-contact infrared thermometers compared with electronic axillary and infrared tympanic thermometers, which could affect clinical decision-making. Sensitivity for fever was low to moderate for both non-contact thermometers.Better methods for peripheral temperature measurement that agree well with central thermometry are needed.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN15413321.This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 24, No. 53.

However, long-term outcome data after introduction of genomic testing in the treatment decision-making process are limited.In the prospective RASTER study, the tumours of 427 patients with cTanyN0M0 breast cancer were tested to assess the 70-gene signature (MammaPrint). The results were provided to their treating physician to be incorporated in the decision-making on adjuvant systemic therapy. Here, we report the long-term outcome of the 310 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative tumours by clinical and genomic risk categories at a median follow-up of 10.3 years.Among the clinically high-risk patients, 45 (49%) were classified as genomically low risk. In this subgroup, at 10 years, distant recurrence free interval (DRFI) was similar between patients treated with (95.7% [95% CI 87.7-100]) and without (95.5% [95% CI 87.1-100]) chemotherapy. Within the group of clinically low-risk patients, 56 (26%) were classified as genomically high risk. Within the clinically low-risk group, beyond 5 years, a difference emerged between the genomically high- and low-risk subgroup resulting in a 10-year DRFI of 84.3% (95% CI 74.8-95.0) and 93.4% (95% CI 89.5-97.5), respectively. Interestingly, genomic ultralow-risk patients have a 10-year DRFI of 96.7% (95% CI 90.5-100), largely (79%) without systemic therapy.These data confirm that clinically high-risk, genomically low-risk tumours have an excellent outcome in the real-world setting of shared decision-making. Together with the updated results of the MINDACT trial, these data support the use of the MammaPrint, in ER-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative, clinically high-risk breast cancer patients.ISRCTN71917916.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

We analyzed post-PCI OCT images and calculated OCT-FFR to identify independent factors associated with target vessel failure (TVF) after PCI.Among 364 enrolled patients, 54 experienced TVF during a median follow-up of 36 (IQR: 26-48) months. Vessel-level OCT-FFR was significantly lower in the TVF group than in the non-TVF group (0.87 vs 0.94; P < 0.001). In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, low vessel-level OCT-FFR (HR per 0.1 increase: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.29-0.49; P < 0.001) and thin-cap fibroatheroma in the nonculprit lesion were independently associated with TVF. The TVF rate of vessels with both low vessel-level OCT-FFR (<0.90) and thin-cap fibroatheroma in the nonculprit lesion was 8.1 times higher than that of all other vessels (69.3% vs 12.4%; HR: 8.13; 95% CI: 4.33-15.25; log-rank P < 0.001). Furthermore, adding vessel-level OCT-FFR to baseline characteristics and post-PCI OCT findings improved discriminatory and reclassification ability in identifying patients with subsequent TVF.Vessel-level OCT-FFR was an independent factor associated with TVF after PCI in patients with ACS. Adding the OCT-FFR measurement to post-PCI OCT findings may enable better discrimination of patients with subsequent TVF after PCI for ACS.

An EACMFS position paper.,"Metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to the cervical lymph nodes has a significant impact on prognosis. Accurate staging of the neck is important in order to deliver appropriate treatment for locoregional control of the disease and for prognosis. The management of the neck in early, low volume disease (clinically T1/T2 oral cavity tumours) has long been debated. The risk of occult nodal involvement in cT1/T2 OSCC is estimated around 20-30%. We describe the natural evolutionary history of OSCC and its patterns of spread and metastasis to the local lymphatic basins. We discuss most published literature and studies on management of the clinically negative neck (cN0). Particular focus is given to prospective randomized trials comparing the outcomes of upfront elective neck dissection against the observational stance, and we summarize the results of the sentinel node biopsy studies. The paper discusses the significance of the primary tumour histological characteristics and specifically the tumour's depth of invasion (DOI) and its impact on predicting nodal metastasis. The DOI has been incorporated in the TNM staging highlighting its significance in aiding the treatment decision making and this is reflected in world-wide oncological guidelines. The critical analysis of all available literature amalgamates the existing evidence in early OSCC and provides recommendations in the management of the clinically N0 neck.Copyright © 2020 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

We investigated the value of interim brain PET/CT (I-PET/CT) for monitoring the response to intensive methotrexate-based chemotherapy in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Of the 76 PCNSL patients treated with intensive methotrexate and cytarabine chemotherapy between September 2006 and December 2012, 66 patients with DLBCL were included in this study. The patient cohort of 66 individuals comprised 43 men and 23 women with a median age of 59 years (range, 17-75 years). During chemotherapy, 36 patients (54.5%) showed a negative metabolism on I-PET/CT, and 47 (71.2%) were negative on final (F) PET/CT. The baseline characteristics were similar between I-PET/CT-negative (n = 36) and I-PET/CT-positive patients (n = 30) except ECOG performance status. After a median follow-up of 27.5 months, there was no difference in the progression-free survival (PFS; P = 0.701) or overall survival (OS; P = 0.620) between the I-PET/CT-negative and I-PET/CT-positive groups. However, PFS in the F-PET/CT-negative group was significantly longer than that in the F-PET/CT-positive group (P < 0.001) without a significant difference in OS (P = 0.892). I-PET/CT may not predict the survival outcome of PCNSL patients with DLBCL treated with intensive methotrexate and cytarabine chemotherapy. Prospective trials are required to fully evaluate the role of I-PET/CT.",NA,21/07/2017,D016428,10.1007/s00277-017-3068-9,NA,NA,NA,,

Emergency health care workers are particularly exposed to stress because of the intrinsic characteristics associated with the job (i.e., life-threatening emergencies, overcrowding, lack of bed spaces). However, these attributes have never been studied using the Karasek model.An observational, prospective, multicentric study in French Emergency Departments will be conducted using a cohort of emergency health care workers. Four questionnaires before a control day and after a nightshift will be assessed every 5 years in the same emergency departments. Also, the Karasek questionnaire, a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory scale, the Hospital Anxiety, Depression Scale, and a food intake questionnaire will be evaluated. Salivary biomarkers (cortisol, immunoglobulin A, lysozyme) will be collected from every emergency health care worker who consents to participating in the study.This study will provide a point of care for the emergency health care workers' stress situation every 5 years.

Biomarkers for sexually transmitted infection (STI) were used to validate self-reported behavior by interview mode. As part of a parent study evaluating home versus clinic screening and diagnosis for STIs, 818 women aged 18-40 years were recruited in 2004 at or near a primary care clinic in São Paulo, Brazil, and were randomized to a face-to-face interview or audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. Ninety-six percent of participants were tested for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis. Reporting of STI risk behavior was consistently higher with the computerized mode of interview. Stronger associations between risk behaviors and STI were found with the computerized interview after controlling for sociodemographic factors. These results were obtained by using logistic regression approaches, as well as statistical methods that address potential residual confounding and covariate endogeneity. Furthermore, STI-positive participants were more likely than STI-negative participants to underreport risk behavior in the face-to-face interview. Results strongly suggest that computerized interviewing provides more accurate and reliable behavioral data. The analyses also confirm the benefits of using data on prevalent STIs for externally validating behavioral reporting.",R01 HD047764|NICHD NIH HHS|United States|R01 HD047764-01A1|NICHD NIH HHS|United States|R01 HD047764-04|NICHD NIH HHS|United States|R01-HD-047764-01|NICHD NIH HHS|United States,6/06/2008,D003160;D016428;D016449;D052061;D013485;D013486,10.1093/aje/kwn113,NA,NA,NA,,

One the one hand, for proper diagnosis, the analysis of molecular factors, especially mutation status of isocitrate dehydrogenase and 1p/19q status in the tumor status needs to be done in addition to classical neuropathology. Further, the high clinical and prognostic value of a maximal safe resection requires a profound knowledge of presurgical diagnosis and surgical as well as imaging techniques to ensure optimal outcome for patients. Also medical treatment may be more intensive than previously believed, with randomized trials providing evidence for a benefit in overall survival by combined chemoradiation versus radiation alone. A critical problem concerns the considerable undesirable effects of therapeutic interventions on long-term health-related quality of life, cognitive and functional outcome as well as future developments in this still difficult disease that will need to be addressed in future trials.© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aimed to assess whether real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted optical diagnosis is accurate enough to implement the leave-in-situ strategy for diminutive (≤ 5 mm) rectosigmoid polyps (DRSPs).Consecutive colonoscopy outpatients with ≥ 1 DRSP were included. DRSPs were categorized as adenomas or nonadenomas by the endoscopists, who had differing expertise in optical diagnosis, with the assistance of a real-time AI system (CAD-EYE). The primary end point was ≥ 90 % negative predictive value (NPV) for adenomatous histology in high confidence AI-assisted optical diagnosis of DRSPs (Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable endoscopic Innovations [PIVI-1] threshold), with histopathology as the reference standard. The agreement between optical- and histology-based post-polypectomy surveillance intervals (≥ 90 %; PIVI-2 threshold) was also calculated according to European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and United States Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) guidelines.Overall 596 DRSPs were retrieved for histology in 389 patients; an AI-assisted high confidence optical diagnosis was made in 92.3 %. The NPV of AI-assisted optical diagnosis for DRSPs (PIVI-1) was 91.0 % (95 %CI 87.1 %-93.9 %). The PIVI-2 threshold was met with 97.4 % (95 %CI 95.7 %-98.9 %) and 92.6 % (95 %CI 90.0 %-95.2 %) of patients according to ESGE and USMSTF, respectively. AI-assisted optical diagnosis accuracy was significantly lower for nonexperts (82.3 %, 95 %CI 76.4 %-87.3 %) than for experts (91.9 %, 95 %CI 88.5 %-94.5 %); however, nonexperts quickly approached the performance levels of experts over time.AI-assisted optical diagnosis matches the required PIVI thresholds. This does not however offset the need for endoscopists' high level confidence and expertise. The AI system seems to be useful, especially for nonexperts.Thieme.

We evaluated the extent of cardiac sequelae 6 months after hospital discharge in patients surviving ICU hospitalization for COVID-19.All survivors of Maastricht-ICU were invited for comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation 6 months after discharge from ICU. Cardiac screening included an electrocardiogram, cardiac biomarkers, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and, wherever indicated, cardiac computed tomography or coronary angiogram.Out of 52 survivors, 81% ( n  = 42) participated to the cardiovascular follow-up [median follow-up of 6 months, interquartile range (IQR) 6.1-6.7]. Eight patients (19%) had newly diagnosed coronary artery disease (CAD), of which two required a percutaneous intervention. Echocardiographic global longitudinal strain (GLS) was abnormal in 24% and CMR-derived GLS was abnormal in 12%, despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction in all. None of the patients showed elevated T 1 relaxation times and five patients (14%) had an elevated T 2 relaxation time. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) reflecting regional myocardial fibrosis was increased in eight patients (21%), of which three had myocarditis and three had pericarditis.Cardiovascular follow-up at 6 months after ICU-admission for severe COVID-19 revealed that one out of five invasively mechanically ventilated survivors had CAD, a quarter had subclinical left ventricular dysfunction defined as reduced echocardiographic GLS, and 42% of the patients had CMR abnormalities (reduced LVEF, reduced GLS, LGE presence, and elevated T 2 ). On the basis of these findings, long-term cardiovascular follow-up is strongly recommended in all post-IC COVID-19 patients.Trial Register number [NL8613]) https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/8613Video abstract:http://links.lww.com/HJH/B899 .Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

These include: Celiac Disease (CeD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). All of these have intestinal microbiomes that are different from healthy controls.
