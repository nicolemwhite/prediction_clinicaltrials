Theclinical consequences of MDS are bone marrow failure and a predisposition to develop acutemyeloid leukaemia (AML). Patients with &#39;low risk MDS&#39; have less than 10% myeloblasts in themarrow and include the World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes refractory anaemia (RA);refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory anaemia with excess blasts-I(RAEB-I). This group of patients has a relatively low risk of leukaemic transformation andthe major clinical problem is the manifestation of bone marrow failure. Up to 80% of thesepatients become red cell transfusion dependent. To date; the only curative therapy isallogeneic stem cell transplantation. Unfortunately; a median age at <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnosis</span> of &gt; 65 yearsexcludes this type of therapy for most patients with MDS. The aim of treatment is; therefore;supportive therapy. Long term red cell transfusion therapy carries the problems of acutetransfusion reactions: iron overload; alloantibody formation; poor venous access and the riskof transfusion transmitted infection. With time; such patients require increasing frequencyof transfusion and obtain decreased length of benefit from transfusion. The quality of lifeof such patients is significantly reduced. Alternative therapies; therefore; aimed atpromoting more effective haemopoiesis and reducing the need for red cell transfusion mayimprove quality of life; reduce the use of expensive resources such as red cells and ironchelation; and perhaps enhance survival.Combined darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) plus G-CSF (Neupogen; filgrastim) in low risk MDS isbetter than best supportive care; with respect to haemoglobin and quality of life. The studywill assess:-the costs of this approach-long-term outcomes-clinical/laboratory parameters allowing early cessation of therapy in patients destinednot to respond; <br><br>STUDY OBJECTIVES:Primary objectives:-To compare the Quality of Life of Low-risk MDS patients randomised to receive prolongedtreatment with EPO alone; EPO with G-CSF or best supportive care alone.Secondary objectives:-To compare the haemoglobin response and transfusion requirements of patients in each ofthese arms.-To compare the economics costs of treating patients in each arm; in order to derive acost:benefit analysis.-To assess the utility of <span style="background-color: #E0B0FF; color: black; font-weight:bold;">prognostic</span> factor and predictive factor assessment; inparticular against the <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">predictive model</span> proposed by Hellstrom-Lindberg.<br><br>STUDY DESIGN:This trial is a multi-centre; randomised; triple arm; open-label trial of EPO alone (withbest supportive care); EPO plus G-CSF (with best supportive care) and best supportive careonly in patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome with symptomatic anaemia and/or redcell transfusion dependence. Screening procedures will take place within 42 days ofrandomisation.Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to EPO and best supportive care; EPO with G-CSFand best supportive care; or best supportive care only. Patients randomised to drug therapyarms will receive EPO subcutaneously every fortnight Â± G-CSF at least weekly; together withred cell transfusions and other supportive care if required. Patients randomised to &quot;bestsupportive care&quot; only will receive red cell transfusions and supportive care as required.Study visits and selected study investigations will occur every 4 weeks for the first 24weeks; then at 36 and 52 weeks.Quality of life (FACT-An and EQ-5D) measures will be used for all arms of the study.Analysis &amp; Reporting:Data will be analysed and reported for all endpoints after the final patient has completedthe 52 week follow-up.Data Monitoring Committee:An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will ensure the safety of patients enrolled inthe trial. This group will be the MRC Leukaemia LDMEC (Chair: Prof. Gordon Murray). The DMCwill meet at the commencement of recruitment and will formulate its guidelines for safety andefficacy monitoring. The DMC will provide a report of their meetings to the TSC. The DMC willmeet at least annually and more frequently if needed.Central Morphology Review:Bone marrow biopsies/aspirates for all patients will be sent for central morphology review todetermine eligibility for the study. All screening aspirates and biopsies will be reviewedcentrally to confirm the <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnosis</span> of MDS and the categorisation of the WHO/FAB subtype.On-study and end of study bone marrows will also be reviewed. In addition; centralisedtesting of specialist investigations will be performed.<br><br>STUDY ENDPOINTS:Primary end point:-Quality of life at 24 weeks (FACT-An &amp; EQ-5D - the latter for use in health economicanalyses)Secondary end points:-Quality of life at 12; 36 and 52 weeks (FACT-An &amp; EQ-5D)-Overall erythroid response (major and minor) at 24 weeks (main analysis point) and alsoat 12 and 52 weeks; as defined by the International Working Group (IWG) criteria-Incidence of disease progression (i.e. to RAEB or AML)-Overall survival-Economic costs of managing anaemia in each arm of the study.<br><br>STUDY DURATION:Patients will be monitored for all study endpoints up to 52 weeks.

The study has two elements: a screening study and asubsequent intervention study.In the screening study; the feasibility and results of country specific models to identifyun<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnosed</span> individuals with Type 2 diabetes will be evaluated.In the treatment study the effects of routine care in general practice according to local andnational guidelines will be compared with an intensive ADDITION protocol; includingstructured lifestyle education (dietary modification; increased physical activity and smokingcessation) and intensive treatment of blood glucose; blood pressure and lipids; andprophylactic aspirin with or without motivational interviewing; on mortality; macrovascularand microvascular disease. Furthermore the impact of treatment on health status; treatmentsatisfaction and health service costs will also be assessed.Methodology - Screening study:In Denmark &gt; 300 primary care physicians from 5 different counties (Copenhagen; Aarhus;RingkÃ¸bing; Ribe and SÃ¸nderjylland) participate in the study. Diabetes-related information issent to all individuals aged 40-69 years enrolled in their practice. A questionnaire(diabetes <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk score</span>29) including age; gender; family history of type 2 diabetes; obesity;physical activity and previously <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnosed</span> hypertension was used. Individuals scoring high onthe questionnaire are encouraged to contact their physician for an examination of randomblood glucose (RGB) and HbA1c. A step-wise strategy based on RBG; HbA1c; FPG and OGTT is usedto <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnose</span> diabetes In the Netherlands all people aged 50-69 years and listed with theparticipating primary care physicians is invited to fill in a diabetes risk questionnairebased on the same risk factors as in Denmark. Those at high risk of having type 2 diabetesare requested to come for a screening visit at a centre set up near the general practice. Astepwise screening strategy based on RBG; FPG and OGTT is used to <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnose</span> diabetes In UK;different strategies are used in Cambridgeshire and Leicester. In Cambridgeshire a search ofcomputerised general practice records is performed; using a simple validated <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk score</span>;based on routine general practice data (age; gender; prescribed medication and body massindex); to identify people in the age of 40-69 years at high risk of having un<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnoseddiabetes</span>30. Those with a high score undergo a stepwise screening strategy based on RBG; FPGand OGTT is used to <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnose</span> diabetes In Leicester all white European subjects aged 40-75years and Asian; black or Chinese subjects aged 25-75 years are invited in a restrictedgeographical region within Leicester. All attendant undergo an OGTT as the first screeningstep (unless FPG &gt; 7.0 mmol/l)Diagnostic procedures:The <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnostic</span> procedure includes a stepwise procedure minimizing the work-load on thegeneral practitioner and includes the questionnaire; random capillary blood glucose and HbA1cas screening instruments followed by fasting capillary blood glucose (FCBG) and an oralglucose tolerance test in everyone with marginally elevated FCBG. The <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnostic</span> criteriafollow the most recent World Health Organization guidelines (31) and are based on two<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnostic</span> glucose values measured on independent days.Exclusion criteria:Participants are excluded if they already have diabetes; are pregnant or lactating or have asevere psychotic illness; are house bound or have an illness with a likely survival of lessthan one year.Outcome measures:Outcome measures from the screening study include measures of the efficacy of the screeningcampaign; the objective health status of patients newly identified by the campaign;feasibility as reported by the primary care physician; and the economic impact or benefit ofthe a programme. Furthermore a substudy explores the psycho-social and ethical aspects of thescreening programme.Methodology - Intervention study:All patients <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnosed</span> as part of the screening programme are invited to enter theADDITION-study. The study will include a minimum of 3000 patients with screen detecteddiabetes. The general practices are randomised to the routine care group (standard care asgiven by the GP) or to the intervention group which features a target driven; intensivemultifactorial approach to treatment. The study is an open; multicentre; parallel group trialwith randomisation of general practices. Patients are screened and recruited during theperiod January 1st 2000 and June 30th 2006. The end of follow up is by July 1st 2009.Participation is based on informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Intensive Treatment strategy:The intensive multifactorial treatment includes lifestyle advices (concerning diet; physicalactivity; medication adherence and tobacco cessation); prescription of aspirin and stepwiseincreases in pharmacological treatment of blood glucose; blood pressure and lipids; accordingto strict targets (appendix 1). The treatment targets are as follows:-HbA1c &lt; 7.0-Total cholesterol &lt; 5.0 mmol/l (4.5 mmol/l if CVD present)but statin to everyone withtotal cholesterol &gt; 3.5 mmol/l-Blood pressure &lt; 135/85-Aspirin 75- 150 mg/day to everyone on antihypertensive treatment Behavioural advicesinclude-Smoking cessation-Physical activity 30 min./day-Healthy diet (low fat; 600g of fruit and vegetables/day)The treatment targets may be intensified during the study according to the results of otherclinical trials published during the study period; as the aim is to strive for treatmenttargets based on the most intensive guidelines available.Within the intensive group a further randomisation allocates 50% of the patients to countryspecific interventions concerned with improving adherence to lifestyle changes andmedication. This intervention; including the use of motivational interviewing) is deliveredeither by a trained facilitator (UK and The Netherlands) or through training of practitioners(Denmark); and is based on a client-centred non-directive counseling style to help patientsexplore and resolve ambivalence and stimulate lifestyle changes; appropriate diabetesself-care and adherence to medical treatment 32;33.Pharmacological treatment:The decision on which pharmaceutical drug to use for the individual patients with is made bythe clinician as the study is target driven and not a trial comparing different specificdrugs. The clinician is provided with recommendations for a treatment strategy (appendix 1);which should be based on balancing treatment effect; side-effects and cost. The main priorityis achievement of treatment targets with a flexible lifestyle and low rates of side effectssuch as hypoglycaemia and weight gain.Therapies are adjusted at 2 to 4-weekly intervals until targets are reached; thereafter every3 months. HbA1c is taken every third month; in between antidiabetic drugs are adjustedaccording to blood glucose measurements in the interim.Outcome measures: see other section.Sample size and statistical power:Based on levels of risk in the conservative-treatment arm of the UKPDS; the expected eventrate is 3% per year for the combined endpoint (all-cause mortality; nonfatal myocardialinfarction; stroke; revascularisation or amputation). With a sample size of 1350 patients ineach arm (standard versus intensive treatment) the study will allow the detection of a 30%risk reduction in the intervention group at a significance level of 5% with a mean durationof follow-up of 5 years.Timescale:The screening study began in late 2000 and will end by June 30th 2006. Patients are enrolledinto the treatment study following <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnosis</span> in the screening study: thus the treatment studyproceeds along with the evaluation phase of the screening study. The follow-up will continueuntil July 1st 2009.Ethics and safety:The Scientific Ethics Committee in the involved counties in Denmark and the MultipracticeStudy Committee have accepted the project; and the study has been approved by the ethicalcommittees in UK and the Netherlands.A data safety and monitoring committee will have access to all end point data (unblinded)after 1; 3 and 5 years; and the study will be terminated if the composite end point(including: Cardiovascular death; non-fatal MI; non-fatal stroke; revascularisation andamputation) should demonstrate a clear advantage of intensive versus standard treatment(p&lt;0.001) or a clear advantage of the standard versus intensive treatment (p&lt;0.01).Perspectives of the trial:The results of the study will be of immediate national and international relevance to policydecisions about screening for diabetes; and subsequent intensive treatment. If the studyshows that screening and early intervention markedly reduces the risk of developing prematureCVD; then the study will have potential important impact at the individual patient level aswell as on the societal level. If the study fails to show an effect of screening and earlyintensive treatment then this would have direct impact on future recommendations forscreening and treatment regimens; and the study could lead to significant savings if it showsthat strict treatment targets are not essential in the early phase of the disease. Theresults of the sub-study will inform approaches to health promotion to the management ofchronic disease and risk; and to strategies to support adherence applicable not only todiabetes but also to other chronic diseases.References and Appendix 1 on www.addition.au.dk<br><br><br><br>####################<br><br><br><br><br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:; <br><br>SUMMARY:Roughly thirty percent of people that undergo open heart surgery get an abnormal heart beatafterwards known as atrial fibrillation (AF). While not life threatening; this abnormal heartbeat increases the likelihood of stroke and delays recovery. There are strategies to preventpost-operative AF; but they are costly and sometimes have undesirable side effects.Therefore; it would be best if we use these preventive treatments only in high risk patients.We intend to develop a <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk prediction</span> model based on demographic and electrocardiogram (ECG)findings that will predicted who is likely to get AF. We will develop this model using dataalready available on patients who have undergone cardiac surgery. The development of thismodel will use the latest mathematical algorithms similar to those used to study geneticevolution. This type of model is capable of looking at many parameters in an unbiased way; sothat only the strongest; independent predictors remain in the final model. Once; the model isdeveloped; we will validate the model by comparing our predictions to actual outcomespreviously recorded in the database.; 1.0 Background Currently; roughly thirty percent of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)patients develop atrial fibrillation (AF) in the five days following surgery; increasing therisk of stroke; prolonging hospital stay three to four days; and increasing the overall costof the procedure [1; 2]. According to some sources; over $1 billion is spent annually on thisproblem in the US alone [2]. Current pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic means of AFprevention are suboptimal; and their side effects; expense; and inconvenience limit theirwidespread use in all patients [3].Though many methods have been presented touting high predictive value in terms of sensitivityand specificity for post-operative AF; none are reliable enough for use in a clinicalsetting. This may be due to the lack of a standardized method for the measurement of certainmorphological P wave features in ECG analyses [4]. Furthermore; the medical community hasrelied on limited variable combination methods for much too long; especially while there areadvanced methods of data mining and decision-making to be harnessed. A Bayesian network (BN)is an excellent tool for making decisions based on collected information and is even able tohandle missing data points well [5]. By combining more types of data and expert knowledgeinto a BN with a Bayesian statistical approach; better accuracy is the likely result.2.0 ObjectivesThe main objective of this research is to develop a Bayesian network (BN) classifier whichcan model/predict/assign risk of the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in coronary arterybypass graft patients through the incorporation of different types of patient data. Expertknowledge coming from doctors in the field will be combined using Bayesian statistics withpatient data and electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis; improving on the Frequentist methodscurrently used. We intend to investigate profit or loss due to the inclusion of the followingdata types:-Collected Data- Risk factors and other medical indicators recorded in the hospital-ECG Features- Time; frequency; wavelet; and nonlinear domain features derived from theECG signal showing AF prediction potential-Expert Knowledge- Cardiologist modified probability distribution and frequency beliefsof input data based on past experience This study will analyze data from patients whounderwent cardiac surgery at Emory University Hospital; Crawford Long Hospital; or theAtlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The collected data will include demographic;pre-operative; operative; and post-operative all taken from the patient&#39;s chart. ECG andavailable telemetry data will also be collected and analyzed for morphological features;which may yield AF predisposition clues.Following development of the AF prediction algorithm; this will be tested on a subset of thedata points extracted from the database. This study is a feasibility study for further fundedresearch.3.0 Patient Selection 3.1 Eligibility criteria:1. All patients that patients who underwent cardiac surgery in the Emory University Hospital;Crawford Long Hospital; or the VA Medical Center.3.2 Ineligibility criteria:1. Emergent operations.2.

The presence or absence of atrial fibrillation will be<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnosed</span> on the basis of an electrocardiographic recording and confirmed by a cardiologist.Data collected will include: age; race; sex; body mass index; blood pressure; NYHAclassification; Killip classification; and the history of previous myocardial infarction;hypertension; diabetes; smoking; alcohol use; antiarrhythmic drug use; presence and type ofpacemaker if any; history of AF or Aflut; previous cardiovascular events; type of operation;and length of operation. Patients enrolled in this study will be given unique study numbersand all identifying information will be removed after correlation between telemetry and chartdata are established. No follow up data will be required from patients.9.0 Statistical considerations: This study design is a retrospective chart review of a cohortof patients undergoing cardiac surgery to determine variable combinations that predict atrialfibrillation following cardiac surgery. Within the cohort; those patients with AF will becompared to those without these atrial arrhythmias in the post-operative period. Probabilitytables will be developed using both groups; thereby populating a predictive Bayesian networkstructure. Many different structures will be evaluated using an <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">artificial intelligence</span>technique (genetic algorithms); which will evolve the structure to its optimal form. K-foldcross-validation will then be used to validate the predictive ability of the Bayesian networkstructure. Sensitivities; specificities; and positive predictive values will be reported onthe results of this validation.<br><br><br><br>####################<br><br><br><br><br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Recurrent; symptomatic venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism); <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Major bleeding All-cause mortality Patient satisfaction with care Medical resource utilization; <br><br>SUMMARY:The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether outpatient treatment isas effective and safe as inpatient treatment among low-risk patients with pulmonary embolism.; Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a worldwide health problem; with an estimated incidence of up to69 cases per 100;000 persons annually. In the U.S.; 101;000 patients were hospitalized with aprimary <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnosis</span> of PE in 2002; resulting in direct medical costs of $720 million. There isgrowing evidence that outpatient treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is aneffective and safe option for up to 50% of patients with non-massive PE. Despite thisevidence; outpatient treatment of PE is uncommon because (1) explicit criteria that identifypatients who are at low-risk of adverse medical outcomes have not been available; and (2)randomized trials demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of outpatient treatment have notbeen performed. We developed a clinical <span style="background-color: #E0B0FF; color: black; font-weight:bold;">prognostic</span> model that accurately identifies patientswith PE who are at low-risk for short-term mortality; symptomatic recurrent venousthromboembolism (VTE); and major bleeding. This model provides clinicians an easily applied;explicit risk stratification tool for patients with PE; addressing a key barrier tooutpatient treatment. The broad objective of this clinical trial is to address the othermajor barrier to outpatient treatment of low-risk patients with non-massive PE; theeffectiveness and safety of outpatient management. We will randomize low-risk patients(identified using our <span style="background-color: #E0B0FF; color: black; font-weight:bold;">prognostic</span> model) with PE from hospital emergency departments toreceive outpatient or inpatient treatment with LMWH for â‰¥5 days; followed by oralanticoagulation. The specific aims of the project are to compare (1) the frequency ofrecurrent VTE; (2) the frequency of major bleeding and all-cause mortality; and (3) medicalresource utilization and patient satisfaction with care among patients randomized to receiveoutpatient or inpatient treatment with LMWH. The primary study outcome will be the rate ofsymptomatic recurrent VTE at 3 months after randomization. The secondary outcomes will be therate of major bleeding and all-cause mortality. The ancillary outcomes will be medicalresource utilization and patient satisfaction with care. The hypotheses guiding this trialare that outpatient treatment with LMWH is as effective and safe as inpatient treatment withLMWH; and is also associated with reduced medical resource utilization and increase patientsatisfaction with care. This study is innovative because it translates a validated <span style="background-color: #E0B0FF; color: black; font-weight:bold;">prognosticmodel</span> into clinical practice and represents the first direct comparison of outpatient versusinpatient treatment of low-risk patients with PE. Successful completion of this project willprovide a strong scientific basis for treating low-risk patients with PE in the outpatientsetting. Outpatient management of low-risk patients with PE is likely to improve quality andefficiency of care by reducing resource utilization and increasing patient satisfaction withcare. Our findings will have importance to physicians; hospitals; and policy-makers who arecommitted to optimizing patient safety and providing high-quality; cost-effective care.<br><br><br><br>####################<br><br><br><br><br><br>PRIMARY OUTCOME:Hospitalization; <br><br>SECONDARY OUTCOME:Death; myocardial infarction Death; myocardial infarction; postdischarge revascularization or readmission by unstable angina; <br><br>SUMMARY:The investigators&#39; objective is to compare a new strategy combining clinical history andNT-proBNP levels versus the usual care; consisting of early exercise testing; for decisionmaking in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain;non-<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnostic</span> electrocardiogram and normal troponin. The investigators hypothesised that thenew strategy combining clinical <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk score</span> and NT-proBNP will reduce the number ofhospitalisations without increasing the number of events during the follow-up.; In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain; the observation ofischemic changes in the electrocardiogram or troponin elevation prompts hospitalisation and;generally; invasive management. However; decision on admission or discharge is uncertain inthe remaining patients. The spectrum of these patients spans from individuals withoutcoronary artery disease to some with high risk unstable angina. An early exercise test isusually performed with the aim of guiding the decision. However; the exercise test is notavailable 24 hours per day/ 7 days per week; around 40% of the patients show contraindicationto exercise and there are inconclusive as well as false-positive results. The limitations ofthe exercise test can lead to unnecessary hospitalisations. Therefore; there is room foralternative tools. Our objective was to compare a new strategy combining clinical history andNT-proBNP levels versus the usual care; consisting of early exercise testing; for decisionmaking in these patients.We will randomly compare a new strategy combining a previously published and validatedclinical <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk score</span> (number of points according to pain characteristics and risk factors)along with NT-proBNP levels; versus the usual strategy using exercise test; for themanagement of patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain; withoutischemia in the electrocardiogram and with normal troponin. In the new strategy; high riskpatients (clinical <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk score</span> =&gt;3 points) as well as low risk patients (clinical <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk score</span>&lt;3 points) but with NT-proBNP &gt;110 ng/L; will be hospitalised; on the other hand; low riskpatients (clinical <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk score</span> &lt;3 points) with NT-proBNP &lt;110 ng/L will be discharged. In theusual strategy; all patients will be allocated to early exercise test; patients will behospitalised in case of a positive result; inconclusive result &lt;7 METS or contraindication toexercise; whereas they will be discharged in case of a negative result or inconclusive resultwith &gt;7 METS without ischemia induction.

This may be due to multiple reasons suchas a higher presence of diabetes; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; obesity; and lowerlevels of physical activity.This program will bring together the Calgary Indo-Central-Asian communities and the CalgaryHealthcare community to help reduce the rate of heart disease and stroke through asupportive; culturally-sensitive program that is community-based through the following steps:1. Increase awareness of heart disease and stroke through education among the CalgaryIndo-Central-Asian population.2. Identify early; the risk factors related to heart disease and stroke through screeningprograms.3. Provide appropriate follow-up care to the population at risk for heart disease andstroke.; Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.Various studies have confirmed that individuals of SE Asian descent have a higher prevalenceof cardiovascular disease compared with other ethnicities due to higher prevalence ofmetabolic syndrome; diabetes; insulin resistance; central obesity; dyslipidemias (lowerhigh-density lipoprotein; increased lipoprotein[a]; higher triglyceride levels); increasedthrombotic tendency (increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and decreased tissueplasminogen activator levels); and decreased levels of physical activityHypertension; in particular has become one of the leading causes of mortality among Asians.Projected figures suggest that in Indo-Asians hypertension prevalence will increase from16.3% to 19.5% between 1995 and 2025. Despite increased prevalence of hypertension amongIndo-Asians; the majority of cases remain undetected and poorly managed.Disparities in health system utilization are associated with a high prevalence ofhypertension leading to increased numbers of patients presenting with target organ damagesuch as stroke; heart failure and renal insufficiency. Epidemiological studies havedemonstrated that high-risk ethnic groups have access barriers to mainstream programs and maybenefit from targeted and culture specific interventions. Given that Indo-Asians represent anincreasing proportion of the Canadian population and are at higher risk of cardiovasculardiseases and experience health care access barriers; the initiation of an tailored riskfactor screening and intervention program is timely.The collaborative effort between the target communities and the healthcare system provides anunique opportunity to develop and evaluate a sustainable screening; early detection andintervention program in hypertension and other CVD risk factors; tailored to meet the uniquecultural needs of the target population. Only an all encompassing program of this scope willreduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases in this highly susceptible population.The project objectives are as follows:-To increase Indo-Central Asian community awareness of cardiovascular risk factors-To develop and implement a community based; culturally sensitive and self-sustainingcardiovascular risk factor screening and management program.-To increase early detection of modifiable; un<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-weight:bold;">diagnosed</span>; and uncontrolled cardiovascularrisk factors-Using a partnership-based; culturally appropriate and integrated approach; provide asustainable and cost effective intervention program for optimal management of riskfactors in the Indo-Central Asian population utilizing existing health region andcommunity resources.-To develop a continuum of care that addresses the needs of Indo-Central Asian Calgariansand that tailors the intensity of intervention to the perceived risk-To validate the &quot;Continuum of Care&quot; processThe project components are as follows:* Screening sessions: The project will utilize a previously developed Indo-Asian DiabetesInitiative methodology to recruit and train volunteers from the target community. Usingstandardized interview questions; the following information will be collected: age; gender;family history (first degree relative with premature cardiovascular disease); and othercardiovascular risk factors. Trained volunteers would administer the questions during one toone interviews in English or a common language used by the participant in the community.Blood pressures will be obtained using a validated Bp assessment tool (BpTRU). All thosescreened that have either high blood pressure (â‰¥140/90 or â‰¥130/80 with diabetes) or at leastone risk factor (positive family or personal history of cardiovascular disease; diabetes;smoker; known elevated cholesterol or on medications for HBP; lipids or diabetes) will thengo on to have capillary measurements of random TC/HDL performed by the Cholestech desktopreflometer (Hayward CA).Based on health history and assessments obtained; the total CVD risk (coronary heart diseaseand stroke) will be predicted using the Joint British Societies Cardiovascular Disease RiskPrediction Chart. Those participants found to be high risk (&gt;20 % 10 year CVD risk) will bereferred; via the family physician; to a HRIC clinic. Those at moderate or low risk (â‰¤20% 10year CVD risk) will be referred to the CDM program. All participants that are screened willreceive the adapted and culturally sensitive versions of the 2007 Canadian PublicRecommendations education booklet (adapted by Blood Pressure Canada) that includeshypertension; dietary; alcohol and smoking cessation information.-Intervention: All qualifying participants will be assessed by a volunteer pharmacist;nurse; physician; or other health care professional who will review the participants&#39;current medications and provide education around adherence and adverse events. Thecompleted assessments and the predicted <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk score</span>s will be reviewed with theparticipant. The predicted <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk score</span> will facilitate the participant&#39;s enrolment in theappropriate follow up program. Participants will be re-directed back to the familyphysician for BP monitoring and medication initiation or adjustment as required.Participants will be provided with a &quot;Health Report&quot; that will include their currentmedications; blood pressures; TC and HDL results; predicted CVD <span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: black; font-weight:bold;">risk score</span> and follow-upinstructions. Interventions will be as follows:-High CVD Risk Intervention: Individuals at high risk will be referred to a HighRisk Intervention Clinic for full cardiovascular evaluation. This includes ahistory and physician exam by an Internal Medicine Specialist or alternatespecialist with similar cardiovascular training and experience An ECG will beperformed and likely either a stress test or nuclear cardiology study. Risk factorswill be aggressively managed.-Low and Moderate CVD Risk Intervention: Individuals at low or moderate risk will bereferred to a convenient and culturally appropriate CDM community program(culturally sensitive education and physical activity programs).-Follow-up Sessions: Consenting participants will be contacted by a project volunteer andbe invited back for reassessment one year after initial evaluation. Reassessment willentail a work-up similar to that conducted during the initial screening session.</body></html>
